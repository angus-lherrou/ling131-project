wow\nDid you know and I found this out when I saw a headline last night was online that YouTube had some service disruption last night\nAnd yet it showed users of blank website frame instead of uh all the videos and I guess it went on for a while to the point where people panicked\nSome of them even may have called nine one one in their panic over what this is the son of the apocalypse holy mackerel you can't live without YouTube so you can start panicking what else am I going to do with my life see Deborah there are people in worse shape than you I I went on the air\nI and I look at it don't matter only occasionally but not in any and a lot of people have hooked up to their TV so they just sit there and they can watch videos and scroll through all the YouTube content but apparently the Philadelphia police how to put out a special message please do not call nine one one for a YouTube service disruption we don't deal with that\nThis story though I I Love this story because uh have you ever been in a whale watching boat yes right so that's what the the background of this story is on a whale watching voted Washington's Puget Sound\nAnd apparently while they're on the whale watching boat you know what happened the wells came in they came close to the boat so somebody whipped up their phone because apparently there was a woman freaking out\nAnd and she coast nine one one on the whales I pledged whether she's supposed to see them\nOh yeah that's why when does the stupid let's play the clip\nYou guys rolling\nBy John Mazie visors another one time [noise]

belief drive away from Boston rivalry for Israel saying\n[noise]\n[noise]\nUh yeah apparently someone whipped up their phone and what you're hearing it sounds like they're together a couple with a husband sounds like a first he's just very impressed is three humpback whales\nWho apparently swim up right next to the boat but you can hear her in the background she actually does call nine one one explains their position and says they're going to kill us I I I'm afraid we might get flipped over I'm really scared because apparently a couple of them went under the boat\nNow I've been on the whale watching trips and the wheels came up to the boat and I don't remember anybody Iraqi like this this is like the craziest amount of panic I think it's like one of the funniest stories of the week it's somebody called nine one one on whales on a whale watching trip\nOr she's got to be out of her mind she said they'd been watching\nFor about an hour and then they were they were right underneath us she wanted us to know just in case the boat capsized said she wanted authorities to know exactly where there were were they were so they could be saved\nWhat would you do if you if you will meet on your will watch it go Deborah called nine one one only\nBack I'd say lady get real this is what we're here for a week came to the way it was what's the problem it has\nHappened apparently a whale oh just a couple of months ago surfaced under twenty foot fishing boat and did capsized it it could happen it could be not intentionally there because the will\nYou'll hear somebody else in the background say they're not gonna kill you or hurt you they're just going to they just want to check you out and then they usually go away because they're curious they're mammals they came up you know you might be something interesting you might be worth eating might be worth just smelling a they're they're very curious it's not\nReally likely like I thought if you went into will watching trip that'd be the cool thing to happen in the wells come on by and I swim under the boat and they're checking the out who would take a selfie yeah instead or you know there's all sorts of crazy people in the world who just freak out over anything\nBy coming up next first of all talked to called the ... special event yes on prop six going on in Pasadena this afternoon you have a chance to get there and

living homes good talk to them what to say about how important it is good You're welcome back to the ... show\nHow low rider or if you talk to you again\nYes nice to talk to you All right so explain to our listeners exactly what you're doing here with regulating sober living homes\n[noise] we have a situation where a halfway houses are allowed to be open and operate in residential neighborhoods completely without any knowledge by any government agency\nAnd the people that run these facilities I have no background checks so we ended up having ex convicts running halfway houses are that are bringing a calm addicts into our neighbor\nAnd it has resulted in a just a really bad condition for a lot of our city\nWhy was this unregulated I mean does anybody oversee this anywhere in any form of government\nIt is a loophole in the law where halfway houses are not supposed to provide any in residential treatments and so they set them up as halfway houses but then since they're not regulated there are services are being provided on site and\nThen turn them into it really illegal operation but the d._a. ... because these halfway houses are not register with anyone there's no way to to even go to monitor and check out the situation and see what's going on and and more important to see who are the operators are at these facilities\nYeah I mean we should distinguish this from license to rehab centers of which apparently a press releases and you've got this from the on the register there's over a thousand license rehab centers but that doesn't kill these unlicensed sober living homes and these are probably the ones that a lot of our listeners complained about because they do bring problems\nTo the neighborhood and they only they make good money for who's ever ...\nOh absolutely because when you're talking about you know people paying ten thousand dollars a month per person or to live in these halfway houses and six people in a child think about it that sixty thousand dollars a month or that they get payment from insurance companies\nFrom family and and importantly they generate a tremendous amount of service calls throughout police department um for instance Franklin many they have nine hundred and twenty six calls for service to the police department that come from just six addresses\nWas okay it was an old one what was that\nUm that storm and says a drug sales or you name it wow well and in theory and when you have these addicts right they're supposed to be in recovery\nLiving in these halfway houses that are unsupervised and no license or no license or treatment provider on site by law that can be there right so then\nThey really are vulnerable to the drug dealers in the community by the temp these guys with with drugs and so they they go out of control son one coverage grow into another example that these are mostly coastal city right um they got six hundred and sixty seven calls coming from just panic dresses\nAnd the thing that makes you really are offensive to me as a kind of choice or is it people a lot of them come from outside of our county\nOkay you have insurance coverage that come from other states they see the ads you know to be able to live in Costa Mesa in the beach city and they like the temperature that like the climate or the Bible and so they come here and then these facility just drain their insurance coverage quickly\nAbout it at ten thousand dollars a month bill ... they'll point to that in within six months and then guess what there's absolutely no criteria that these halfway houses have to achieve a certain level of success and so they burned the ripple through their coverage and then get what they stuck here in orange county then they become\nHomeless homeless right exactly\nYeah I mean you are right and you reference to send your press release the Orange County register I mean they should have won in ...\nNight so they lead the brewers three to two in the national league championship series game six of tomorrow Milwaukee they just need one more one more wind to move on to the world series or see if they can take on the red Sox are the Astros and the red Sox won last night so their head in that series three games to one and then LeBron is making his debut as a Laker tonight they're up in Portland\nOr to take on the trail blazers the first home game for the brawn as a Laker will be against the rockets coming up on Saturday well we've been doing some weird science stories scientists have noticed that a fish have been exposed\nTo Prozac and when the fish are exposed to Prozac they get a little bit horny ...\nUniversity has done a study animals were given the drug in a tank in a lab and they spent more time chasing females than those\nThat were not exposed to Prozac and the water now this is an issue because we talked about how drugs that our drugs wouldn't we flush them or get rid of them through our normal waist across seas end up in the fish\nSo I suppose this makes this the fish should just a bit a horn here because of the levels of antidepressants in the water the Antarctic shelf ice shelf is singing which is weird\nThey're talking about a journal physical geophysical research letters which which Nick brought into work today\nOr they have found that the ice shelf which floats on the southern ocean next to the Antarctic continent researchers found dozens of seismic sensors they buried them under the shelves surface but when they went about to analyze more than two years of data they discovered that the rough surface which they call a fern layer\nIs constantly vibrating because of the wind it's vibrating in response\nSo the changing weather conditions and when the temperatures rise or fall for instance when storms re scope the snow dunes et cetera the fern is alive with vibration which actually sends out a tone that it's\nThat it's almost singing very very strange\nAnd then someone actually did a scientific study as to why we hate hearing about other people's vacations why we hate hearing about them which is funny because we love telling people about them at the same time first\nIt's under ... it would they wanted to understand why people value and experience okay as opposed to stuff\nPeople value experiences because they believe those experiences are more reflective of who they are so if someone talks about a recent trip they took their actually talking about\nThemselves which proves to them to be more rewarding Harvard did a study and it talked about the when you talk about yourself and an experience that you've had it causes neural activity in the area of the brain that's associated with sex cocaine and good food\nGood like it's like in a scene from nine and a half weeks when you start talking about your own experiences it feels that good but they also found that it was irrelevant whether you were actually talking to anybody who is listening\nKind of like this show because talking about yourself is inherently enjoyable regardless of whether or not the audience even exists\n\nOkay the study also shows\nThat those who had an extraordinary experience ultimately wish that they had an ordinary experienced instead so they'd be able to relate to their parents for example you go whale watching and an orca\nOr I don't know flops itself onto the deck of the boat that's an extraordinary experience and when you relate that story but people look at you like that that could never happen\nThere's zero relation there\nWhat I thought was most interesting is people never predict correctly when asked if they think others would be interested in that extraordinary experience\nIf you ask me about my whale watching trip and if Deborah would be interested that the killer whale flopped itself onto the deck of the boat and then flopped off I go oh yeah she totally want to hear oh would want to hear that reality proves the opposite\nStory tellers often think that people enjoy being told new information in reality people are more likely to enjoy story if they're familiar with the subject matter if I tell you this great\nStory this great story about my ... in central California caverns you'd say that doesn't have never I don't think that's the thing I said oh that's nice [laughter]\nA a relationship psychologist as people are generally pretty self absorbed which was why it doesn't register that nobody wants to hear every single detail of their recent vacation\nImagine the old the old image that you have about your parents setting up the slide projector and talking about their experience on their vacation when everybody else is really only there for the ... they could care less about the actual vacation\nMy wife says this every time when I wake up and I go\nI had the weirdest dream and I just her eyes glaze over because I always assume she'd be interested in hearing about my crazy dream meanwhile she has she's only smiling and laughing thinking about uh uh what she's going to do for the rest of the day and not registering one word of what it is that I'm saying about it\nBut when you take an informal survey of friends um you can\nYou can eat very different reasons about why you don't want to hear someone else's vacation I don't want to hear about your dream vacation because it's not mine maybe it comes off as a you're bragging\nWent to Costa Rica and spent two weeks and the men will Antonio national\nFor owes or it's a way to get attention from the opposite sex but\nAny other reason uh is probably just inherently annoying the reason why you would tell a story about your vacation and expect other people do enjoy it All right a reminder we have a thousand dollars that John Kennedy going to going to be giving away just after the top of the hour in tomorrow's news and Bruce is still

because you're bothering these residents right next door every night\nUm we we wanted to do it and then there might be some credibility but at the moment they're not enforcing anything here\nThat's really very reasonable mark you're absolutely right and again there's two sets of laws\nIn in California right now the launch for the homeless which they get to break many of the rules in any of us trying to do we'd be hauled away fine but not not because they have such sympathy and tolerance for this situation they forget that the residents have to live with this I don't think our city has that many homeless people camped outside the home probably bone and either\nHe tried to maintain that there there was somebody down the block from the from the ...\nMayor's mansion that occasionally makes too much noise or something like that\nI did they say anything that appealed to you [noise] um [laughter] yeah you have to stop all he was I\nI I was impressed by how guards city handled um the opposition the boisterous\nCrowd shows some boys um [laughter] it was completely on hinged by it oh yeah and almost\nUnable to speak on occasion and I think the new chief is just getting to the ranks right out doing with this kind of a of opposition um but he he did step up to the plate or in a couple of places one is that he said that he is directing his officers to go back\nTo enforcing the beach curfew between twelve and five AM and that they will start removing the something like forty tense and encampments that are now out on the beach\n[laughter] um so\nLet's see if that happens and the other one is\nHe said I hear that you want to talk about crime and problems in Venice we will have a a crime a public hearing or a town hall for you to ... just discuss those matters\nAnd I've already gotten an indication that they're looking at the first or second week in November So this was very um useful in other ways to\nI'm getting the cities to deal with the deterioration of quality of life and safety in Venice\nWhich has really amped up ever since my father he got elected 'em they're just as bad I mean the cops will tell you that it was office and he personally has told people to back off on enforcing a variety of different laws and it's really created a a very dangerous situation for many people here\nAnd what does it seems I heard from them montage we played more can they be given more details that a lot of residents have been and feel like we've done enough we have enough homeless people we have enough services why are you doing this to us I mean it sounds like you guys are the most impact in outside of Skid Row in the city of LA\nAre I think along with Hollywood we are um we went um from four years ago with about four hundred homeless up to over a thousand and uh the other ... the myth that they keep putting out is these are Venice homeless or these are\nThat way home with me I'll just\nTheir neighbors right\nRight sure um you know one of the fellows quoted a part of a scout I'm a filmmaker who went out and just a random interviews with the home and he produced a video that you played a yesterday\nI Know about all those people that route to do that said they came over the country they one by one you know I came from Texas like April Kansas the country\nWhen I'm a young fellow name or Tim part was running the teen project down here on when we're I

Missouri um how many of those folks um are from LA and he said\nWell my experience is it over Seventy percent of them are from out of state\nUm and that was the same experience DePaul had when he made his his film um and I don't know who is down down on Skid Row and I don't know who's in Hollywood but I'm clearly here we've been attracting um homeless from all over and part of it is because of these very public\nPronouncements that have gone nationwide about we're going to spend one point two\nBillion dollars you know housing for the homeless right\nWe're going to spend another three

laws and you have a voters bought is is to tell you why do you [noise] but until you have that voters box chain we will not enforce laws that are unconstitutional\nLook for more appropriate site we

city's not spreading out the services to other places they're dumping them all here in benefits or accept in the past three years the crime in our city out of control if there's no law enforcement or\nOne of the things that I hate the most about the spin that I'm seeing coming from up here is the way that pitch the opponents of this empty a lot of people who don't get\nHomeless that's not fair

and these are three strikers\nWow isn't that horrifying we'll talk about it was showing Hoffman legislation director for the California district Attorneys Association after the news at three o'clock\nOr so about an hour ago I was faced with a rather pale faced rather upset Deborah mark who talked about not coming to work today what's this about\nOh you know I I'm having a really hard time I almost want to cry yes yesterday with your motor cyclists\nYeah this is worse than I Am having a really bad months I don't know what is going on\nLeno I run a rhythm I Am I to check your horoscope yeah and it said it wasn't a terrific month either see right don't buy lottery tickets\nI Know it's this one's a bad when I was driving to the doctor today to get my flu shot on civil I was very responsible\nGoing fine I see this man walking his three tiny little white dogs he's on a cell phone and he's he's going the opposite direction so I'm leaving my house and he's kind of going towards that way and I see all of a sudden\nA pit bull broke through the gate\nOf the house I started running after these dogs oh lamb on my breaks in the middle of the street I throw my my door open and I'm screaming I Hope nobody seriously caught this on any kind of video based on past no I mean my throat is hurting I'm Serious I could hardly talk I screamed so loud\nI'm screaming that I'm trying to help this guy and I'm screaming at the pit bull the pit bull stops and looks at me and then I'm thinking in a split second well what do I do if the pit bull strike wish right\nYou're right you can have my spray because I was on the way to the doctor and you have your shocker no no\nAnything on ... you know I didn't have that so so I knew I had a feeling\nI knew where this is the dog owner lived in the guy who's poor dogs are getting attacked told and he also so Iran and I'm banging banging on the door and I'm reading the doorbell he comes to the door yeah [laughter] I said\nYou know was attacking three tiny dogs really you've got to come out\nQuickly so that all of a sudden you see that you know so it runs in one of the little tiny dogs with so spooked somehow it got off the leash and the pit bulls changing the ... it was the dog's screaming [laughter]\nI'm Serious I'm so upset about this and so the owner of the pit bull grabs the dog\nAnd I think the owner of the tiny little dogs was in such shock yeah so the owner the pit bull says well did my dog bites your dog and the other guy says well I don't know if any skin was broken I\nStart screaming at the owner of the pit bull and I said you know what you have a pit bull you have no color on your dog and it broke through your yard and I said you know I Walk my dog by your house and I'm scared\nDon't walk your dog by my house that lady oh really and then at the aggressive dog here I said I obviously you're pit bull know who's the aggressive dog hear your pit bull [laughter] he says no you can comment on that\nOh I Wish we had video of this I got in my car and I drove away shaking and I've been so upset and I'm I'm doing some things are not going to say on the air but uh\nWhat do you mean well the reporting of ... something something like that oh did you what you said the two dogs right three dogs yeah you know little little finger jugs\nYeah and that these three dogs they the irony is they don't like my dog they always bark at my dog they scream at my dog let's not do these are my favorite talked and I want people sending me emails telling me that I'm this horrible person that I don't like pit bulls I I don't have anything really against pit bulls I have some against some not all\nAnd you always always look for what was going to criticize me and why\nShould if first of all it's a pit bull coming after door ripping up three small dogs\nYou have a right to be angry about it oh I Know but you know a lot of tension emails and they'll say it's not just switch it or delete I Do I Do read them I trust me I just I okay if I read them because you're looking for information and lights just in case the emails like a good one exactly like the like I Do like me but like I Do\nLike I made it All right but I don't like the dislikes and I just well that comes with it but this guy was such a jerk can I not once did he say to the owner of these poor tiny dogs I Can't get the screening out of my head it's so horrible not want to say I'm so sorry\nA few years ago in the same thing happened to me I was in my house when I heard all this noise and it sounded like a small dog and I ran out and sure enough\nI was too late though the woman's already holding a dinner and oh you got much to go through like the ... broken by just a vicious and\nIt wasn't a pit bull and what the heck it was a mixed but I did find them on the street and I did try to color them oh there was nice whoever they broke out of the yard and they found a small dog and they just jumped on it [noise] yeah\nBut to see the dog and the lady was oh and it wasn't her dog she was taken care of it for somebody else which really traumatized her 'cause it's like you know what do you do now when they come home to do\nThat in fact later on the day the guy on the dog walking up and down the aisle and asked me if I saw anything so I only saw the aftermath I really can't give you a much help as to whether how exactly unfolded but it was a sad tragic\nVery ... I don't know how these three survive I mean I watched it I couldn't believe my eyes and this poor guy is is trying to corral his three dogs and the pit bulls going after it in the when the one got loose in the pit bulls chasing it oh it was just one of the worst things I've experienced and I and\nI'm not trying to be a snowflake or over drama fight is but\nI'm traumatized I'm not going to lie I really am I I've had a really hard time getting over this to that you need some pills\nWell making its way through the appellate courts where they use the same logic to apply for fifty seven relief to sex offenders and I I don't see how you can distinguish between the two based on the rationale of of the court in this case don't\nYou know there'd be a non violence sex offender would [laughter]\n[laughter] it it it there are a non violent sex offenses I mean they're not things that I I think the average person would think of as being non violent\nRight but you know raped by intoxication that's right under the code right\nAnd um you know human trafficking involving sex with a minor lewd acts against a fourteen or Fifteen year old these are by definition under California law non violent\nI remember Jerry Brown saying oh don't worry sex offenders there the other side is just trying to sell you would make you a fearful sex offenders are not going to be released into prompted the seven I Believe you said that\nYeah yeah we were accused of fear mongering and using scare tactics that we were fact mongering we're telling people what was going to happen and you know it's it's one of those cases where I Wish we'd been wrong yeah fact\nWe were we were right on the money and it's it's taken you know two and a half years for this to to work its way through the court but the fact of the matter is\nThis was a fatal flaw in ... fifty seven uh it was something that\nBecause of the process by which prop fifty seven made its way to the ballot with um you know coming into into print after the public comment period it was something that they didn't get a thorough vetting a before it ended up on the ballot let's\nTalk about a three striker is because I think a lot of our listeners know there is it that makes sense to them but it may be some listening don't just because someone\nThird since resulting in the three strikes sentence was considered and non violent and we know that there were some offenses that are quite nasty invited but they are not labeled as a violent do sense but we could also the first two strikes could've been very ugly right\nAbsolutely that it that is you know sort of by definition how you get to a third strike 'cause you have to prior convictions for serious or violent felony\nRight so but this doesn't necessarily mean but I mean this is going to be up to a parole board to make these decisions for these three strikers\nCorrect so ... fifty seven doesn't guarantee parole for anyone it guarantees them a\nAn opportunity for Pearl so they go through a public safety screening through CDC are and then the people who make it through that have a parole board here now with the non violent second strikers to prop fifty seven has already applied it's not an in person parole hearing\nIt's a it's a paper review the board reviews their file and then makes determination\nOh okay so the the process for the non violent third strikers it it sort of remains to be seen what that's going to look like my understanding is the administration is drafting now new regulations to comply with this\nUh this recent court decision that says you have to give these are these folks an opportunity now whether they give them whether that looks the same as it does for all of the other people under ... fifty seven or whether they come up with something more rigorous for this particular population remains to be seen but\nYou know really the the rationale underlying this this decision was you can't treat the non violent third strikers differently than the other non violent offenders so you know it remains to be seen if you can even do something different for for these guys\nMight be three to four thousand inmates\nAre that's yeah those are the numbers that that I've seen as well\nHoly mackerel well you guys called it you said this will be coming to know you do believe that eventually this little apply to the sex offenders\nI don't see how it wouldn't um I I think\nThat the non violence sex offenders and certainly there are also violence sex offenders their their sex offenses that are violent\nRight about fifty seven wouldn't apply but for those other ones\nLike the one you mentioned rape and until they were unconscious person rape of a\nOnly talked about trying to beat this ballot initiative back in twenty sixteen we had that list exactly of the senses are considered non violent like some of us just shook her head and so you gotta be kidding me justice theories dangerous things\nYeah and those are those are non violent by by definition and so you know if the determination as far as who gets ... fifty seven relief that hinges on whether you're a current events is violent or non violent I think the non violence sex offenders have a very good\nA good argument as to why they should be eligible for ... fifty seven relief and in fact when they when they filed their uh their case earlier in the year\nThey won in in February it's something the administration is continuing to fight but I just I don't see how in light of this decision I don't see how that how that a prohibition stands up\nI mean wasn't just really just the way for Jerry Brown to sell this to the public don't worry it's only going to be nonviolent offenders didn't really know though in the end the courts would make these decisions because it seems like the agenda is due to empty the prison since we've been seeing for the last seven eight years I mean I I\nCan't say what was in the what was in the governor's head but uh certainly we had told him well in advance hey this is this is a serious problem this is going to be a a a you know horrific consequences of\nYou know what you're trying to do under under prop fifty seven so ah he can't say that he wasn't worn a he he disagreed with us at the time and and certainly um you know I think that showed in the\nThe campaign on ... fifty seven\nWe were uh you know painted as the a boogie man will join you were scaring the your tactics right yeah\nUm you know but at the end of the day that\nYou know the people who who sat in that room with them are very smart prosecutors they know the law and uh as as much as we wish we hadn't been right we were\nAll right thanks Shawn Austin for coming on I appreciate it hey thanks\nBut showing hopping legislation director for the California district Attorneys Association this will be the legacy of Jerry Brown\nTrust me all this prisoner release stuff to preserve dumping ... forty seven fifty seven this is the legacy an alliance he told a couple of oh don't worry a three striker is in sex offenders that doesn't apply to them ... yes\nDuring a news conference this morning the suspects had been identified and they've been taken into custody Nicholas ruse release twenty six and Larry Corinne oh twenty six both from LA\nSo I'd like to also now we're going to do some digging into this what are their backgrounds this is what cops you're facing this is what you're hearing\nDistrict attorneys deputy district attorney speak out against all these prisoner release spills ... forty seven fifty seven ab one oh nine this legacy it's gone back seven years now is releasing and putting dangerous people back into play\nWell remember what happened officer Keith Boyer in Whittier couple of years back he was shot to death by a guy who benefited from a be one of mine because under a B. one and only the prisoner dumping bill the idea was don't send them back to state prison whenever you have to do we don't want to see them\nThey're going to be under local probation or watch and\nThat doesn't necessarily work out over well very well and then when there are violations it's like well no not serious enough you're not sending them back for that but in the case of officer boy or a guy wouldn't have been on the streets we had a different rule then we got more are coming up on the Johnny can't show here on KFI Deborah marked with a new something\nAnd as you heard contests talking about San Bernardino county sheriff's deputy has been shot at an apartment in Adelanto where\nThe two suspects in custody we

into what's going on in some of the local politics leading up to the election on November six to\nBe talking elements sort\nThese needle exchange programs\nThe update is\nThat looks like to get some really far left progressive is trying to push policy on a very peaceful pleasant place of Costa Mesa which of course has had many issues to deal with including rehab homes and homeless population itself or he'll update is coming up after the news at four o'clock and don't miss for thirty\nHomeless apparently have taken over a park in West covina\nWhich of course are among other things little leaguers play in the park but just to give you an idea it's so disgusting they're apparently I mean there's feces\nPeople open drug use dug out so regularly covered in urine and feces are going to be talking to the little league president in West covina Adam homes\nAfter four thirty also play a news report earlier a montage of people complaining about this and what is the police chief and the mayor say all that coming up in the big four o'clock hour you're on a KFI or an update now on\nThe disappearance of the journalist from Saudi Arabia Jamal ...\nAh he disappeared earlier this month when he went to the Saudi embassy in Turkey to fry to obtain a marriage license\nIt looks like at least if you believe these stories and my problem with this from the beginning has been turkey Saudi Arabia you know runs those countries even though they're quote allies of the U.S both of them\nIt's a very tenuous situation there and that I don't think yet you know we got the royal family running Saudi Arabia and we got this Turkish president to appear was almost going to be overthrown a couple of years ago and there's a lot of dissent in that 'cause I just don't know what to trust\nNow the hurry you got the daily news\nHave you read that ever Deborah more could hurry up the only news now I have it it's a Turkish newspaper they're\nThe ones that claim that they've gotten a hold of the audio of the execution of cash Yogi inside this consulate\nNow there are also reports and I've seen the photos of passports scans and what was supposed to be the Fifteen member hit team that landed in Istanbul into private jets from Saudi Arabia on October second and headed to the conflict so I'm guessing if the stories all true her she'll give me some kind of appointment and once they found that out word got back\nArabia to like go get that guy we don't like him and the case you don't lose a journalist\nAnd ah I guess he's written some pretty nasty stuff about a life in Saudi Arabia I must be real bad I I don't know much about it my he Washington Post apparently used him he's appeared on some of the cable news networks I don't follow that closely Saudi Arabia news I Know\nI Know it's not exactly the most free is placed on the planet that I Know but of course you know they still do beheadings and it's not bad when you have a murderer and that's a nice quick way to execute them\nSo ah the story according to this hurry it daily news is\nThat on this end it there claiming it's a video recording of ... being killed in dismembered the Saudi council Mohammed al ... is a speaking in the audio recording and apparently he says we have to do anything to get rid of the evidence\nOf what happened here or it says he's caught on audiotape during the interrogations during which the journalists fingers were cut off and then he was beheaded\nSo they weren't trying to do a harsh interrogation by telling them you know they do that in the movies you don't tell us finger and then that finger and then that hand and maybe that arm eventually though I guess you didn't tell them what they wanted to know because they took his whole head off according to the story\nOr he was saying do it somewhere else outside or I Will be in trouble\nHe returned to Saudi Arabia this week before Turkish police searched his surveillance video shows conflict vehicles a diplomatic plates arrived at the council's home about two hours after ... walked into the consulate so\nThis guy knew pretty quickly that he that he had to get out of there you want to be a part of this well the twist today is actually a couple of them\nAre one of the members of this a legit hit team that I mentioned before who's passports were scanned is must show cited out bus Donny thirty one year old lieutenant in the Saudi Royal Air force is um he died in a suspicious traffic accident in Saudi Arabia this week\nSo this is somebody that they didn't want to talk they want anybody to catch them I Know it was going on is this like this is right out of a movie script like you've got to cover up what you did and then you have to knock off ... maybe the whole team is going to eventually be or\nBe killed so that they don't say anything and telling tales about what happened to touch Yogi or the other thing we're hearing is\nAnd perhaps what's gonna happen here is the Saudi Arabian government to venture going to need cash Yogi was killed but it was some sort of ...\nBy somebody inside the Saudi Government that the crown prince did not\nAuthorized this has nothing to do it there's somebody went off on their own I think that's going to be a collective story that comes out whether or not it's believed\nRight when we come back we'll be talking elements or about what's going on in Costa Mesa especially with a needle exchange program is being pushed by the activists Johnny can't show KFI am six forty Deborah mark how's the news now\nWeekends KFI are a little bit different for sure you know Neal what do you what do you grill it well I'm whipping up some cured more silly and fried ... goals so bacon and eggs\nAbout starting to see how that will always believed in fact today the drones you probably know that handled the lawyer but did you know he wears robes and aware ... when he does handle\nPhone and I'm like okay we're\nNot we're going we're got news indeed talk that would surprise you weekends on KFI struck by any\nCuts hey Angela in orange county and I already officer involved\nShooting on Deborah Martin live from the KFI twenty four hour news ruined the sheriff of San Bernardino county says it is not known if a deputy who got shot in Adelanto was ambushed\nThere's a slate of candidates running for city council in Costa Mesa that are being back by pro needle distribution organizations and by Katrina Foley who voted on February twentieth to look for more locations uh for the portable toilets for transients\nNow now she's backing candidates who are backed by pro needle distribution groups is our revolution I don't know if you've heard of it is a hard left Bernie Sanders socialist movement and they're backing Moore Reynolds and Chavez and our revolution publicly support needle distribution\nAnd there are also other organizations that have a endorses needle exchange program and their members are walking in support of these candidates and this is all documented the candidates\nThe candidates that have come out clearly against needle distribution\nOur mayor Sandy Guinness radicals and Michelle Figaro Wilson and myself\nAnd so what you have going on now is basically political double speak and the same way that Katrina Foley says she didn't support the original portable toilet proposal what she doesn't say is that she put forward her own proposal for for portable toilets and so now these candidates\nThey may say they don't support needle distribution but when pressed to my knowledge they've never given a clear no answer to supporting a different version and the groups that are supporting them are publicly saying they believe that these candidates will support a different version of needle distribution and solve documented on my Facebook page\nIt does cause I looked up our revolution and American progressive\nPolitical action organizations banana Bernie Sanders twenty sixteen presidential campaign and they're they're basically trying to take over the ... government\nThey've endorsed all these candidates and they clearly state publicly that they back this needle distribution program and that has me concerned\nAnd um before I forget I Want to let you know we're we're we're going to keep speaking up on this we're going to hold another rally to set out a clear no to this needle distribution I Want to encourage everyone to come on out to the original to the original proposed location that seventeenth and Whittier on Tuesday October twenty third at four pm\nWhat is the situation with drug use in homeless these days and coast may says it's centered in certain parts of the city\nOr you know as far as homelessness goes we actually have a network for homeless solutions in Costa Mesa we're trying to help people up and out of homelessness which is a good thing and I wish other cities would replicate that we've helped to almost three hundred people\nUp and out of homelessness we're really trying to do our part we're trying to find housing for them the problem is when people don't want help and then the same thing with this this needle and drug use\nWe want to help people up and out of drug addiction so let's help them let's get them connected to the resources they need\nBut let's not enable and encourage them by handing out needles I have three small children for two and one I Do not want them stepping on needles in the parks or anywhere there's absolutely no way they can pick up all these needles from everywhere this is ridiculous\nCindy in as you said gave up on this needle exchange program they kicked it out right\nThat's right they were the Santa Ana initially welcome them they want it to to say hey you know we'll we'll try to help you out and they did it and it was a failure the needles were all over the place people were stepping on him first responders were were\nGetting pricked and they were finding them in the libraries I mean every place that the kids go in the parks and so they kick them out so these people went to the state and said hey can you give us a permit and so state in all their wisdom said yeah we'll do that\nAnd of course we're stuck stuck with the effects there's no way you can make this a better program\nUh it it it's just it just got got got bad news written all over it\nI mean the line I always say well it's a needle exchange programs you're supposed to come with the use needle to get the fresh needle but apparently if you're finding all these dispose needles that's not happening people are just leaving the old legal blind just going to get a new one isn't it sounds like\nRight and they want to hand them out at a rate of twenty to one and so now the these these groups are being backed by this our revolution is Bernie Sanders hard left group and\nThis is all public information and these groups are organized and they're publicly supporting this needle distribution program and that has me concerned for the safety of my kids and the people and they are like people who have kids I'm concerned about their safety as well\nOriginally it says to the program is allowed to operate for two years in certain areas of close to me as long as the Anaheim orange and soon as you mentioned Santana which drew a permission for the uh the needle exchange but now what you're doing is you got some sort of a court hearing coming up next month overall this\nWell we we've been in court and we hope to have an answer a mid November ah hopefully it's a it's a good answer that takes public safety into account takes into account the safety of the kids in our community\nAnd takes common sense and into account we're all for helping people up and out of homelessness up and out of addiction but we don't want to enable or encourage and give out needles and I certainly don't want to know pro needle distribution a groups coming into play in Costa Mesa politics yeah\nI think if you if the ... the ... going down to the needle exchange program and goes to me you're probably going to draw a larger number of them to come there for their free needles\nIt would be a draw and that's you know and I'm I'm thankful for the leadership of mayor Sandy Ghana she has really been a at the front end of this radicals has been speaking up about Michele Figaro to Wilson and myself have been clear that we do not support needle distribution in Costa Mesa and we're going to do everything we can to stop it\nBut what's your Facebook again I don't I just uh they search for my name's I'll find it okay how long or elements or thanks for coming back on the show and tell us about this All right thanks can really appreciate it that's\nThe mayor pro tem of ... bringing us up to date of politics in that city but yeah it's something you have to be careful as we focused a lot about the progressives\nIn Sacramento dominating the legislature not all of them are Bernie Sanders type left wing or but you know we're talking about the Kevin dealing owns right now how the Sarah's\nAnd and now we got a senator Kamala Harris local politics too young to be careful because we've been trying to take over the city government next thing you know homeless needle exchange programs everywhere right more coming up with a Johnny can't show your kids would have thousand dollars right now\nThe or shot at one thousand dollars now the nationwide keyword bills to two hundred
