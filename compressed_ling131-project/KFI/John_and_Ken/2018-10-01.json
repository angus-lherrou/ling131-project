{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "During Shannon [noise]\nTrying to catch up it was coming up in a few minutes when we were talking about this study that shows from the bureau of Labor Statistics that shows the third leading cause of workplace deaths behind falls and crashes happens to be homicide shooting stabbing cutting slashing piercing poisoning that sort of thing\nAnd then a lot of times the two traits most correlated with white collar violence narcissism and psychopathology\nAnd Shannon of course\nFound a site coffee and I'm ... wait don't tell anybody [laughter]\nYou took this one already I look at any one right yet whether it'll in little bubbles or that's all right so are you there is questions you're used to rate of someone's psychopathic or antisocial tendencies and I'm supposed to ... each personality trait on how it applies to me so it either\nDoes not apply applies to some extent or it applies perfectly so we'll go down the list you're right mhm glib and superficial\nOr like I'm insincere or shallow you can be that way some I Would say some extent yeah a grandiose exaggerated Lehigh estimation of myself I'd say applies to some extent extent a need for stimulation like I'm prone to board them yes I Would say I wouldn't say perfectly\nBecause I'm pretty good about finding stuff to do a little ... and stuff to do because you're bored\nYou need to do to plays perfectly yeah oh okay a pathological lying I lie to make things go more smoothly yes supplies to some extent yeah I had you lie to me and no ... no that's not [laughter]\nNow you're lying [laughter]\nI'm\nHunting and mean manipulative I cheat and manipulate people now that does not apply to me or that I have a lack of remorse or guilt\nThat does not apply to ... uh that I'm a shallow or I have a shallow aspect applies to some extent superficial emotional responses I rarely connect with others emotionally emotionally I think applies to some extent um callousness and a lack of empathy\nSometimes oh wow well because I was supposed to fill this out remember how you went after Adam about his shorts\nAnd then he found out in his feelings for her and you daily hair hurt he didn't care\nEither obviously sorry a parasitic\nLifestyle I'm able to work but instead I live off of other does not apply okay a poor behavioral controls I pour control over my behavior I can be short tempered hothead suddenly irritable annoyed and or ...\nTo some extent okay I Will give you a [laughter] we're taking those passed\nOn whether or not I am a psychopath or sexual promiscuity applies does apply to some extent or does not apply I didn't know you before I don't know how or miss you if you are but you do have a long list of of ex girlfriends with weird names\n[laughter]\nEarly behavior problems like under the age of twelve I had serious behavioral problems such as persistent lying cheating theft fire settings cruelty to animals truancy drug use vandals and violence running away and or\nFree conscious sex before twelve cloud does not apply does not apply lack of realistic long term goals I never really gave much serious thought to the ... not apply um impulsivity I'm impulsive I don't think before\nI act I would say to someone like that yeah\nIrresponsibility I have little to no sense of duty or loyalty to family friends\nI may engage in behavior that puts others at risk ... high finance was poorly does not apply okay a failure to accept accept responsibility for my own actions I make excuses where I rationalize behavior I blame other in our circle now not at all um many short term marital relationships\nSo there were there was definitely more than three marital relationship so marital really oh\nSorry my answer that one wrong of\nPsychopaths can't read a juvenile delinquency I bet they just sent relationship before you're married no no no short term marathon and have a juvenile delinquency\nIf you have a history of serious antisocial behavior Seventeen and younger\nOr or some formal contact with the criminal justice no no\nReplication of conditional release violated probation now and then the last one criminal versatility that sounds like if you're a criminal in adulthood um does not have different types of crimes et cetera so it does not apply you got so you and I we had the same you took the same thing you know during the break I take\nI took the same thing and we had probably almost nearly all of the same answers\nAh okay so ... when I push submit an figures out my test I Hope this isn't one of those things like what flavor ham sandwich would you be\nA says I'm a nine well that's good so on that test a typical psychopath would get a maximum of forty someone with no psychopathic trades were tendencies would get a zero above thirty you have a severe psychopathology\nA but people with no criminal backgrounds usually score about a five\nNon psychopathic criminal offenders about a twenty two so a total score what was yours mine was nine out of forty nine\nWas fourteen but I answer that one wrong so I'm going to go with twelve a total\nAnywhere between ten and Nineteen on this psychopath test would place in individual as mildly psychopathic\nI like things to go smoothly\nRemember if you followed along and kept scored home this is not a diagnosis\nThis is this something on the Internet\nThe toll to the gym and was a psycho paying a ... mile high up yet only a doctor or qualified mental health professional can make an actual diagnosis of psychopathology and recommend treatments\nUm but that is a a that is a little eye opening was it\nWell but you would be somewhere between twelve and a fourteen on the cycle all psychopaths or bad\n[noise] [noise]\nI mean if I Wish you could see Deborah phase right now 'cause that always joke that was the last topic I don't think all murderers or bad you know that's not the same thing\nI Want to know where you're going with this I don't think I don't think all will pass or bad John all agree with\nMe she said do you think have you wait a minute this is a good one I think he would get\nThe same score I got on the test or a and John not a bad\nPerson you'll have to send the link to him so that he can take that test 'cause that's\nWhat a it's a psychopath test and I got ... [laughter]\nThat's miles [laughter] festival are like\nThat and I my my backup is I like things to go smoothly so you know so times\nYou have to to be not completely honest oh right\nYeah lie to yes you lied to smooth things over yeah yeah but you you're psychopathy tendencies run\nDeeper than that I was going to be on social lives [laughter]\nOut of order [laughter] out of or have you ever get it back out drawn senator\nUh sometimes I fell asleep [laughter] that his answer that I didn't pass out I felt [laughter]\nSo I fell asleep on a staircase and admissible [laughter] I'm All right well you notice when you don't remember anything right yes I'd like I was telling generally I had to explain that to my daughter the difference between\nPassing out blacking out and just going to bed 'cause you're tired right did you give example of the ... you said I said if I stop\nDrinking now I'll just go to bed but if I have three more older pass out right after that I'll blackout right something like that\nThat's a that's a progression it's good that you're teaching your children and then I made her go get me another beer [laughter] how do you what are you guys have ... very soon we're going to be a releasing the voter guide\nOh that's right yeah it's it's a ... we were working furiously to just not what Ken was I was watching the baseball EEO but he was and we were going to do ours and\nCry on [laughter] yeah I Do this to do a voter guide I Know what the hell for their well there is a vote coming up and I'm like well I Know that [laughter]\nWell if you you know you don't want to take the word of a mild psychopath [laughter] who's going to do that I don't want her to vote to\nHave the higher score you or me\nI think we would you know I'm going to send you a link All right and you take it [laughter] it's a quick minute taking well Ken's talking about the voter\nGuy [laughter]\nAll right John it came up next we'll see you tomorrow they drive everybody to know next\nWeek for the whole area's so dog Jerry and Shannon\nK pacify Angela in orange county and I already had another\nOne I'm Deborah Martin live from the KFI twenty four hour news from a person has been killed in a small plane crash and burn KFI is Andrew Mullen back reports live it's the second fatal plane crash in the area in two days\nThe latest crash was a beach bonanza plane that went down to your bracket field airport firefighters the the plane went down a little before noon today the FAA says early reports are that the plane may have a tree and approach to the airport a pilot was killed last night flying into the same airport\nOfficials say the pilot was practicing landings and crashed into a plant nursery\nThe NTSB is going to investigate both crashes recording live Andrew Wellman back KFI new\nAmtrak has ruled out the first in its new fleet of electric diesel locomotives\nI don't know I don't think it's open I mean if it's an open air slide outside the bill no it's not an open air salon oh okay I think it's enclosed and trying to find the picture here I went to this\nBuilding once like a year ago but I didn't go in the sky so I went to a restaurant there so I ...

Kavanaugh investigation which are really just got underway all they have until friday right so weak\nOr they spent the weekend they did calling classmates\nIncluding this guy's making headlines

are probably a drunk out of their mind and now now we're going to analyze this\nIs so so so absurd\nAnd that's what I like Trump started and now it's become well what if we find out the judge capital this characterized his drinking habits wouldn't that be considered deception to the Judiciary Committee wouldn't that be reasons to withdraw the nominal like really withdraw the nomination go there because he missed characterize the level of drink and get out\nOf the hour network I could open the door to other lives\n... it never ends that Obama admitted in his book that he did cocaine and

there\nThere's simply no information like when we come back we'll play some of that we'll talk about this prosecutors report and the one thing that Trump said today that got a lot of attention is he

tables\nBecause she's taking photos\nAnd she went to Facebook and she's actually a recovering addict herself Jessica wait a minute\nBut she says there's black marks on these changing tables and that is probably leftover residue from drug use see the black marks these are from Bert spoons addicts use these tables while they shoot up there could be residue from heroin meth whatever and other harmful bodily fluids\nOh they're cooking yeah they they hold on me they bring the table down when they say harmful bodily fluids yes on the diaper changing\nTo see that so she's warning people if they're gonna use to make sure you're really clean them first thought the baby keepers ah keep his name was dirty low yeah\nYou have said they're hooking drugs on the changing team yeah because it's a it's probably along a bigger space for them\nTo just ... and it's more private yes\nEspecially if you're doing it later at night when there's not a nobody else in the restroom you just go in there and you pull down the diaper changing table and you set up the drug like really hard to share the\nWorld with these disgusting drug addicts um because I mean they're really gross they throw needles all over the place they ... they found the baby changing tables\nMean there there really is ... ... you know it's probably blood stains there [noise] uh yes I mean it's really a foul group of people to

KFI news\nAmtrak has a next generation locomotive that will start pulling trains in Southern California seem and vice president Armand kicks as the charger locomotive runs almost entirely on electricity\nIn a while there's ... there there are a bunch of crazy leftist on the Ninth Circuit court but what what's going to be their cover argument\nTo try to give this a legitimacy\nThere they'll probably they'll come up with something um in terms of [noise]\nWhether it be discriminatory or um you know they'll go back to something very probably set during the campaign or something you know what what they get to shut down some of its schools you know I I\nCould tell you the truth I'm not quite sure because the laws very very clear it for anybody who is a public charge or is deemed to potentially become a public charges in physical it's pretty straight forward in\nA while the early ... the law was straight forward on his travel ban to that the president has the right to limit what he wants from coming into the an edge that still took a what a year to sort out\nRight right but what did we see we alternately thought the Supreme Court overturned it so I'm you know if it does get challenged in court or will probably get challenged in a more friendly circuit like the Ninth Circuit court of appeals I guess is that you would be something that again would\nWork its way up to the Supreme Court and I would I Would guess that the Supreme Court would uphold it because again it was pretty clearly written that that public charges and that's all\nSo this would probably we'll just have a big impact on on people seeking green cards would we say there's a high percentage of people that see green cards and in that have become that are public charges\nFrancis is not who's the director of US citizenship and immigration services that each each charged with with adjudicating green card application\nYou spoke earlier today and and he was asked that very question he thought it would maybe impact you maybe a few hundred thousand I Believe this is the number that he used\nBut remember there's a waiting in line for green carts of about four and a half million so if if one person is deemed to be a public sharks and and and get ruled in admissible there's got to be somebody else waiting in line right behind them ready to come into your ...\nAre they going to base it on whether you're taking welfare benefits now or killed path if you if you've been off taking benefits for two years or ... and you can get a green card and they can hold it against you\nKnow yeah it it's your current\nSo when you get a green card or what they're judging is once you get your green card will you accept welfare about a bully you lean heavily on welfare um if that's what they're looking at so they're looking at at that time that you are issued your green card and get US citizenship or about a five year span are you going to access\nPublic gets dry five yeah you can't be on
