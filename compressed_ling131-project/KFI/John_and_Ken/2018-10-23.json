assemblyman can since you wrote their property says voters should look to the ocean\nProbable cause to get a search warrant probable cause to do a search um it really is not the same as having enough evidence to make an arrest me you're going to arrest somebody on probable cause but ah but if the if you don't have the evidence of it doesn't hold up a there a time limit for those people are going to get a ... there'll be set free\nUm where they like to join the guns wouldn't have to do something where they illegal drugs were the illegal guns\n\nWhether the drugs were illegal guns weren't a man that the reason that the guns and the drug charges because the\nA there's a law against against a illegally possessing drugs with guns together so that that so that is a church so there\nAre so right where they I mean if you if you really thought they were a high risk possible sexual predators shouldn't have you and the Newport Beach pleased on where you could take 'em off the streets no\nWe we did all we could have taken one of the streets and we were working to get a you know to get what we needed from the from the Newport\nAren't ... why would you leave the part right well just explain this because there's there's a gap here and I'm trying to understand it maybe it's me if you find the drugs and the guns and the money\nIn January and there is strong\nSuspicion as it sat in the search warrant that these were high risk sexual predators\nWouldn't that be enough in January to arrest them just on the drugs and the guns\nAnd then give Newport Beach the time it needs to process all the terabytes of photo and video information that they also sees and all you needed was a little bit of that you didn't need all let's say they did five hundred women oh you you just need it you know five women and then you'd have enough to start\nPricing felony charges on the sex assault\nAs well I mean the sex assault would be there live on video live on camera I couldn't take that long to view a few of them and they just add more charges along the way but the key here is to get them off the streets in January well now tell me why that couldn't have been done\nSo first of all it was not our tastes in January was Newport Beach police departments case in January they were not bringing it and and asking us to review the case they were telling us what the evidence was in the area to review the case and they were telling us that they needed a better a cooperation from the victims and and uh then they simply were not ready to\nPlay what about what about the journals and the guns do you do need cooperation on that directly also have it in crime\nOh we don't we're not we're not in the business of piling up a little part of the case may be losing a the evidence on the rest\nOf it are in my mind that you need to have the evidence together to bring that to\nBring that if you have a strong suspicion that women are getting sexually attacked and raped wouldn't you use drugs as a hook to get them off the street and stop grapes\nSo we did not have the evidence to to uh to bring those charges to court and make them stick at that point was born in January rent but\nThe drugs were there there were some drugs there\nBy somebody with possession of cocaine all you need is the cocaine you don't need anything else\nWell you know you don't bring a case like that and then unravel the rest of it because uh because of making a premature a raft we needed the information we needed to gather up or to put\nThe ... but it's you know there may see it you realize it could have another victims during this time period that elapsed\nNo responsible a district attorney would have would have brought the case without having they without having the evidence for the\nRape charges I don't understand why you couldn't separate the drugs and the guns from the rapes\nIf we bring the case to begin with but we're going to unravel the case for the for the rapes and those are those out and poured and that's important part of the cave understand you know possession of drugs with a misdemeanor it's a misdemeanor professional firearm or in your own home is a is nothing the chances of them getting out on\nLooking at the videos you don't ... you don't have to look at terabytes of terabytes you need to look at a few examples to set\nSet the precedent for the case you know with no later on you could add you know a hundred or a thousand other charges if there's that many victims it said something in the story that they were also sidelined by because he's a surgeon\nBy patient confidentiality when they were sorting through the computer files in an slowed them down and ... should confidentiality if you're breathing somebody know that but it could have been they were trying to get into files it could have been his patience and they can't do that\nThat they probably didn't know what they were looking into they're trying to find the video and the photographs of the women

authorized bonds to fund the specific housing assistance programs and two is authorized bonds to fund existing housing programs for individuals with mental illness\nAnd we didn't really find anybody but we will\nHave joined more lock the state senator on after three o'clock he is and no one one but a yes on to how 'bout that we're no on both on our voter guide we a general war is no more borrowing money\nFor anything that's how we feel yeah well you know what because we just saw the ... report that came out a few or how many billions banned the state is in a ... long term debt obligation I on top of that\nThe horrific pensions and health care we're going to all these government worker and I don't trust\nAny anybody in Sacramento to spend the money right away right so you don't want these are going to pass easily because bonds always people pay no attention\nTo they don't know what the word bonds means they don't care they don't look at it I Know they don't barring its principal interest pay back its load it'll get they pass the tax oh it's not a tax on me it's just borrowing sure yeah you you wonder why they keep jacking up the taxes\nA lot of it's the pay back all the old debt ... or ... humiliates Everytime you vote yes on a bond\nWell know there's still about proposition to this is not going to be what you think it is what what they just want to do is they want to use existing monies for mental illness and they want to build some homeless housing\nRemember that leaves sued and I thought it was a good point you know the tax on millionaires than Darrell Steinberg got past years ago that's an extra income tax they collected for the for the mentally ill yeah well I wanted to use some of that money not just to give the mental illness treatment I think to build them housing and she sued saying no that's not what it was four\nBut that's what this got caught up in I think probably what John ... pointed after a\nThree o'clock ... looks like they found the cut up remains\nOf Jamal ... the Saudi journalist\nWho went into the Saudi embassy in Turkey and uh did not come out\nAnd according to the Saudis are we were having a chat or there was a disagreement there was a fist fight and we had to December him really that last part seems a little arch yeah yeah he was resisting that's there's two Oh yes you got to choke hold and then he died and then we cut 'em up\n[noise] [laughter] well they they believe that things happen to ruin it somebody pulled out a bone saw\n[laughter] your favorite but I Know I read a\nHorror movie I cannot get that phrase out of my head bones well it's to cut through bones somebody somebody wrote today that's ... that's one of the reasons that this has become such a big story is that somebody used above and saw and that just really captured people's attention because I read that the Saudis started a war in Yemen\nThat's going on a day have yes they hugged they've killed a hundred thousand ... they're fighting to another Muslim faction kind of thing right so the guy running 'cause it's it's clear that a hundred thousand dead ... a A R are worth less than one Washington Post called just getting all the attention addict [laughter]\nWell here's the deal they believe reports say his remains have been found in the garden of the Saudi council general home with his temple ... that apparently is where the specialists team took it\nReally that was good thinking we're going to take this you guys were hiring you to dispose of the remains of ... All right we'll take them over to the garden of the they probably figured that the Turks can't search or or well I Would not be one of the places they might look I'm guessing these they do these kind of a it was rolled up in a carpet you did they do these ... things in Saudi Arabia because\nThere is no one to call Monica in court so somebody steps out of line you get out the bones saw yeah come up you throw the body parts in the garden and who's going to say otherwise right there's no free press there there's you know the the Saudi kingdom runs everything but now they they got outside\nOutside they're a little bubble right there in Turkey turkey is not the freest nation in the world but there's there's well that but you're right that's probably why they picked the Saudi councils property 'cause they thought well the Turks can't necessarily march right any right\nThey might not find it here but someone else might think that might be where they cook it then because they bought a safer there the guy is fairly well known in his circles so he walks into the into the consulate and doesn't walk out\nWell yeah people are going to know the body double walked out you had a buddy the other part of the point I was just really like something out of an old this Keystone Cops yeah and now the debate is whether or not it was a plane killing it was spontaneous said death\nWhich do you pick a ... you know somebody brought a baseball team there somebody brought the bones saw\nThey planned right they set the team there they were just there to interrogate the journal it I mean I don't walk around with ... with one of those interrogation went awry and ended up in a chokehold and ah after we killed them while we had to cut them into pieces apparently his face was very disfigured too which means yeah they probably work them over yeah\nI don't know what what does he want to know from these did they did he have a secret or they were just at the crown prince to like the guy he fed by the way we cancelled our anti Saudi Arabia our that we normally run oh yeah a Tuesday Afternoon out of respect for the bones so that's right it's like okay you guys when\nI well riots or ourselves will go through ... wanted to they're not very exciting will get through them quickly with state senator John more lock Johnny can show Deborah Marquez news campfire six forty\nListen to KFI pocket a cold Grant's pass a lot of LA marketing their next chance to win happens within twenty minutes\nOkay bass\nThan her radio\nPlane crashes on the one on one and I'm Deborah Martin live from the KFI twenty four hour news from a vintage plane had crashed on the north bound one on one free way and if we're a hills it's in North bound lanes that part of the wing hit the center divider\nThe traffic has been stopped in both directions the plane did catch fire the flames are out now and the pilot was able to get out and is not hurt we'll have more on how this is affecting traffic in a few minutes fourteen more people have accused a former USC gynecologist sexual misconduct\nLaw says it took visits to other doctors to figure out that her treatment by George tend to all was off at ...\nAnd that protocol and gave him the benefit of the doubt because he was a doctor\nLawyer Gloria already now represents fifty women who accused of Dr of misconduct she claims USC knew about the abuse in the early nineties\nUSC failed to protect students from Dr ... and dead conceal the fact that they had received complained about him and for Mullen back KFI new\nVideos the sheriff's department and Mexican consulates said public safety is more important to then immigration status\nFree thirty second public service announcements have been produced in Spanish telling people sheriff's deputies do not enforce immigration law while on patrol we\nBuilding like really really cheap housing in an expensive area\nOr a building housing but having it subsidized so that a a good part of the cost is ... is paid for by the tax payers so that the a return on investment can be taken care of with lower rent by individuals that are below certain income up\nSo you are against this one\nWell I'm against the fact that when we don't need to add more debt you sort of already made my point that you know when you borrow for building and they're saying it's going to cause six billion an interest in principle but it's probably more closer to a like you said eight billion or the state doesn't need to take on another general obligation bond which\nIs a fix payment that's payable in good times and bad times and you you already said if it's bad times you know Sacramento is going to look to to to have a tax increase to make the payments and that's just not a smart financial move\nBut there's every year and there's a new set of proposals to borrow more money and more money more money and and and most of the time it seems people do for it\nWell they pass Ninety percent of the time actually that's why Arnold Schwarzenegger when he got frustrated by losing all of his ballot measures for got up and said that I say built it let's just start issuing bonds like crazy but we have twice the amount of debt load of any of the state of any state\nCompared to the average or we have a four point seven percent that low compared to two point five around the country we have a debt per capita twenty three hundred and twenty three dollars versus a thousand twenty five and the rest of the nation and and we're about four percent of GDP while the rest of the country as a to point to one percent\nSo that just too many numbers for the average person\nIt is it may go thing but we ... my eyes glaze over a but when you look at our balance sheet ... we have the largest unrestricted net deficit of a hundred and sixty eight point five billion dollars that doesn't include our retiree medical liabilities and Ninety One point five billion so when you see the next\nComprehensive and you'll finance report from the state of California it'll have an under will be underwater quarter trillion dollars so I'm just saying it's not a good time to be borrowing money\nRight now let's move over to prop to authorizes bonds to fund existing housing programs for individuals with mental illness now apparently you are a yes on this John and explain what this one is doing\nThis is a a a a bond that would be taking a revenue stream\nWe have the mental health services act which was approved by the voters in two thousand four with prop sixty three this is known as the millionaires tax I don't see that tax being eliminated or or or removed or in the near future even in the long distance future because the millionaires or only one percent of us\nSo you take that income stream and you say let's borrow against it we're just going to use six percent of that revenue and you don't have a new tax you don't have a new that you're actually you have a debt but but you have it paid for with an existing revenue stream\nAnd so we need to house mentally ill homeless people before we can\nDo any diagnosis and then do any treatment and and we have such a major need especially in LA county and Orange County and this is an opportunity to build immediate housing with support services for those that are homeless and mentally ill I think it's a compassionate and it's an affordable thing to do and\nThey can't do that already they need this particular proposition to pass I\nI think you could say that about ... one as well because we just had a twelve billion dollar surplus theoretically but um this this right now the mental health services act the money is not being used barely at all everybody's sort of\nA ... got a analysis paralysis and they're not spending it and about two and a half billion is\nSo then I have a few related but they they pass the tax Thirteen Years ago and to this day and they really understand the purpose of the decks\nRight and so now we're saying here let's at least allocate six percent of that I'm Out to some things that get the ball rolling\nYou know it's hard to believe that this was Darrell Steinberg millionaires tax write for mental illness programs\nCorrect right but there weren't any mental illness programs that ever\nWell they tried to spend some time in housing I think somebody sued isn't it won't happen saying you can't spend that money on housing for the mentally ill\nCorrect there's it's tied up in Sacramento superior court and so senator Kevin de Leon and myself we joined authored Senate bill\n... six this year to put ... two on the ballot for Republicans and Democrats can work together to try and meet a a need that's a growing need and and the homeless ... in LA county alone the last year\nHas gone up fourteen percent so this is this is something that would would fit into compassionate you\nKnow component of your portfolio\nAll right John ... thanks for talking to us about these two propositions\nThat You're welcome Johnny can't hope

say it's are you\nTrying to you know it's not my act together our look describing don't you think if your average\nThe IQ of all the people who bought the lottery tickets versus the average IQ of

becomes like\nYou know some stupid number that you would never spend any way so why does he get more interest to me if it was it if it was it you know fifty million right fifty million is\nGood yeah no you're right as a billion and a half because it's just why on the money you're never going to spend that's why they tweaked the game a couple of years ago so they can entice the idiots who I Am not gonna do it if it's five million dollars for three hundred million yeah now you got me interested yeah you're right it's like who's the Jack\nCalling us and you know billions not enough for me I'm wait until it gets about a billion six ... and then I'll jump\nIn well it's more monkey see monkey do they get caught up in the excitement other people to buy a ticket they want to buy the ticket you if you see monkeys buying lottery tickets no\nI Know that we're going to want to mess morning yeah there was there was a guideline is through animal [laughter] it's an ape on line to us now the deal I had a draft in front of me at seven eleven yeah ah if you take the cash lump\nSum it's nine hundred and five million dollars the one thing I didn't know about this and it's about the only good thing that can be said for California you don't have to pay state income tax on the lottery prize California does not\nAdd they miss that I I don't know why somebody must have said well you know a lot of people bought out or anything that's Thirteen percent they could detail exactly right that's the high end of the bracket\nUm other states so do the right not all states do that other states do take their share of course she didn't have to pay\n... see that they they think it's that they're entitled to their\nShare I Know that your money or the federal you're not going to get away from the federal taxes though and you're in the uh thirty seven percent bracket which kicks in it five hundred grand for singles in six hundred thousand dollars for couples this year\nSo according to a couple of resource sources the IRS will his whole twenty four percent of the winters lumped check what is the issue that's two hundred and Seventeen million dollars if you win the whole thing\nThan another hundred and Seventeen million will be do by the end of the year\nSo that's what you've got to pay the feds if you were to win this prize yeah because you'd be in the forty percent tax yeah it's the the three hundred and thirty four million dollars you have to hand over there now the other thing that was uncovered a pretty good story\nIn Fox News is that what happened and it was an age old question to the judge and Ken show John ... remember what about the lottery money\nYeah always been sold as it's going to go to education for the schools for the ... ...\nWell they started in California the California lottery over Thirty years ago and we didn't live here than but they must have made some kind of a whopping promise because for decades that stuck in people's heads the lottery money was going to transform the school system right but\nIt was over they spend fifty sixty billion dollars on schools mostly on the lottery money was always just a small fraction of that\nI Know but it must have been way over sold in the campaign to legalize the lottery [noise] well it must have been at the like the issue that convince people to go for it\nAll of them\nTo grand next hour

so close everything down again pick up all the debris and move that thing out of the way they put out the fire quickly the pilots okay\nBut ah yeah more than one was through said that the the small plane was meant to resemble like a World War two German plane\nNow was that I don't know does that it's got that cross on the wings that you know who who who paints their plane to look like a German World War two\nWas trying to what was it Snoopy and the red Baron kind of doing that red beret and I said I don't know what's wrong\nYou argue at a plane first of all ... fly a plane from the Nineteen forties [laughter] no but if you did have a plane from Nineteen forties would you paid it like something from the German army he's a World War two buff [noise]\nNow one of those things it's coming out of the bay area besides stinky homeless problems and this is hysterical San Francisco chronicle recently did a story about how not to be a gentle fire in the bay or do you know what did I went to a fire is\nI saw this I Can't believe this is like that arise a concept this is a debate well the problem now for the progressive\nIn the bay area is it all the rich tech people\nWant a place to live and they're moving into San Francisco neighborhoods and driving out the poor folk and the middle class folk so so that's called gentrification\nSo what the rents go up because the bumper person owns a building thinks I got a better chance to make more money with the rich tech people so you know what I'm going to drive out below renters I just what I Would do\nWell yeah I had a victim of losers that's why they started firing braille millionaires\nNow I get rich wouldn't do that every person of bitches about this stuff would do it themselves if they could Oh absolutely yeah but this is a phony issue\nOf all the phony PC issues out there this idea of who you're a judge or a fire and then throw a long\nTime residents are getting pushed out of the city because of rent hikes F. and you so ... so they [laughter] they talk to a oh a organizer for a housing advocacy group called Y. A. H. yeah\nYes to affordable house very few people self identify as a gender fire but if you're moving into historically this invested neighborhood\nDid he didn't vested disinvestment not or I mean for I mean pork everything's gotta be you'll from is that what this crowd\nYou don't want to say pour it just nobody invested in the neighborhood for a long time and so and if you have economic educational end or racial privilege you may be taking part in the process of privilege gentrification ...\nThat's another word that has white privilege has to be flushed down the toilet privilege I don't want I don't want to hear anybody carry it out about well\nYou've got a certain privilege don't show it to you don't get your own privilege they'd be alone with just oh privilege privilege educational privilege no people people work to get their kids good education people work to make money so they could live in nice neighborhoods\nSo Anna cash says oh Anna cash\nAssociate director of UC Berkeley urban displacement project that's another word displacement displacement socio economic status plays a big role if your income a significantly higher than those living in the neighborhood that's a sure fire assign you a gentle fire my God they have all kinds of weird names to call people\nGender fires are often but not always white\nOh there you go that's the root of this isn't it another way to take a whack at the white guy\nRight or she said oh another the activists says this is Megan for work would or would Russell\nAn organizer with she said there's no getting out of jail card you can't do all the right thing to absolve yourself so that you're no longer a gender fire just because you know or no you can't just like you can no longer be a white person but you can check your biases acknowledge your privilege and fight the system as it creates gentrification\nIf I make money and there's a new neighborhood I Want to move into I'm going to do it this what is her name making or would wrestle or one of those hyphenated names God river you see a person with a hyphenated name often they're headache current events\nAnd in the story which is the only true line well when rich people moving into a neighborhood their money comes with them which could revitalizing area the problem with justification isn't that the neighborhood is changing per se it's not that everyone gets to stick around to reap the benefits in many cases longtime residents were asking for these kinds of changes\nAnd they were ignored well wait a minute left at work if you're going to have you got to make your money\nWhat's wrong with these people she claims\nEven if you're priced out of your own neighborhood you could still end up being a judge for fire which is the first thing that occurred to me it's like well people are moving\nTo these poor neighborhoods because they can't live in the wealthier neighborhoods right correct so they do what is normal which everybody ought to do go wherever you can afford it they they're not standing room whining I well I Want to live here it's not fair that I Can't live here so you got to go find them they've already can afford\nAnd so they moved to a poor neighborhood and they ended up changing it making it nicer because this crowd was always saying well how come nobody invest money in this neighborhood wiser now people are now that's no good so which do you want\nSo if you want your fire they included a slide show to tell you things you could do like smiling at your neighbors and thinking twice before calling the [laughter] the most important thing to do was to recognize the history of your neighborhood in city don't treat the place like it was a blank slate before white people are gentrifying hydrogen\nGas just as racist stuff so this is classic stuff as racist so wow you know people can live wherever they want to live and they don't have to clear it with her or anybody else on moving here because I Want to live here and I already are in the money I didn't steal it from you store your own money\nThis is like saying you know we want the place to continue to look like crap\nI don't come here I I have no God I Swear to God like I'm a list of a thousand things I Want to hear about that is number one thousand to make a new shoe at everything I've often said that Southern California has a really nice places but a ... I'm hoping ginger fires take them back\nTo the places that have gone to talk of hell yeah I Know absolutely it was nice places to visit again those people are responsible for having\nA having a crappy neighborhood you got to go in there and money\nTo do something valuable ... brings something of value back to your neighborhood whining about everybody else might come and go to ... and his name is mark June is I mean one of the big U.S Supreme court victory some months ago he was a government employee non union though in the state of Illinois\nJohn and Ken show Denmark has been ... KFI am six forty\nPaul Hi [laughter]\nHow old are you\nKidding me that kind of joy and your life when a thousand dollars on your next shot happens within twenty minutes Kay ... with the loss angel in orange county and I are really small plane\nCrashes on the one oh one I'm Deborah Martin live from the KFI twenty four hour newsroom traffic on the one oh one freeway is a mess throughout Bora hills because of a vintage plane that crashed\nOn the freeway both sides of the one uh one have been shut down and federal investigators have been called out the C. H. B. says the plane flew out of ... airport this afternoon and started having trouble this guy says he saw the plane smoking\nIt was a freeway and the [noise]\nAnd I found liberty Justice Center he is staying the record or vice president\nWhere the conversation on their their public entity meaning that they're not in it for the money I'm there for the principle which I Believe them and uh we filed a case in two thousand Fifteen and the rest is history we've we want our case we made a point\nAnd it's what what is it what does it mean to the average union worker now what what is it that well ...\n... adds up December you know the the I'm Sorry June twenty seven you know I'm I'm jumping ahead sorry um the ... the Supreme Court decision said that as the twenty seventh\nNobody should be and the union unless they affirmatively declare but they want to be in a union and in that sense\nYou know declare that they're waving their First Amendment rights and of course the Indians are pushing back saying oh no no no he signed the card or Twenty years ago you know you're still and you're still valid well the question that I always raise is how many people that are now working at the public sector actually voted on union\nAnd ask for that representation\nAnd where is the green certification if you will of that union to cover that group of employees and I wouldn't venture to say that probably close to Ninety percent of them because of natural turnover retirement and so on\nNever voted to say the ... union wanted to be represented you know for an individual\nHey is this ended up costing in reality a lot of money to the unions\nWill that has yet to be seen 'em we'll have to wait and see now in the state of Illinois or I'm a native born and raised a our governor declared that are on the day of the ruling and executive order that no more a fair share or agency fees are taken out of paychecks\nI'm somewhat immediately stopped in Illinois but in other states uh you know it's a fight because people are saying I don't want to pay these fees anymore\nBut they're still having to pay unions are providing much a misinformation about you know case in fact there was a lot of people that don't even know about the case and obviously the unions are not going to provide that information and so you know that's what I'm doing now is I'm kinda touring the country\nTrying to get their information out to people let's say look you have a choice you have a right to decide for yourself whether you want to be part of it or not part of it\nHow does and that's all we're saying does this work then with respect to the collective bargaining if you decide not to be a part of the union not to pay to see are you still covered by their negotiations\nAbsolutely yes because you have to remember that and it varies by state to state um but the unions the public sector unions whether it be asked me sci you whoever they went in and got legislation passed and asked for that exclusive fed exclusivity\nSome bargain for all those people so they asked for it\nAnd now that you know we have this ruling now they're saying that oh well you know now we have a you know we we've got to include everybody and you guys have to pay for 'em but in reality of the decision you don't have to pay for\nAnd that's the crux of the matter and that's why the unions are providing this misinformation\nMark we appreciate you coming on and then having those included in your tour around the country you informed\nLook employee union members that didn't have to pay these fees\nWell here's the thing\nYou know the answer out there and that if you're not a part of the Indian or a member of again and you're going to lose your pension well that's false because ... the pensions are provided by the employer have nothing to do with union right they say you're going to lose your health care okay well that also because the employer provides health care about him\nAnd I could go on and on but uh you know there was a um individual I ... a day at a meeting um that he wants out of the union are saying oh no you have the voluntary thing that you have to pay and then you look at the Sacramento beat\nA newspaper out of Sacramento the story in there a ... that was the talks about it\nRational reason for the rest of the leadership not authorized WWW dot congressional leadership on TV [laughter]\nThey October twenty third what's new today on the free I our radio I heart\nVery it's on the radio ads on radio film is a million of reaction between the Dodgers and White Sox\nWith the higher radioactive ESPN Radio wherever you are you a story may fall in love with words history fainting and tell her in the championship for the first time in more than a century World Series on ESPN Radio he's on the\n[laughter] we're going to have you read the details because I'm a lady in weight because you're a lady cut off the air and chanted weekdays at ten am on camera\nJohnny Cash or John ... okay I Am seeing more and that will give you the full run down about tomorrow's show and active auto body coming up after the news at five o'clock the yes\nOn six proposition six\nReally if you're only going to vote on one ballot measure the skip the governor's race and everything else please just vote yes on six the other ballot propositions\nI wouldn't say there's a lot of kids ... to them but six repeal the gas in the car tax\nWill talk about it we'll talk about what we're up against two forty three million dollars in growing coming from the no side talking about all this in the five o'clock hour along with that caravan the only other Side Story to the caravan of John I were talking about it briefly off the air one listed sent the link\nWill it get wiped out by a hurricane [laughter] yeah the odds of that although it's probably not hurricane Wilma\nIs making its way we're still in hurricane season so October but this is a this is a citizen or a storm yeah exactly and it's going to a smash into the Pacific side of Mexico it's already apparently affecting a cluster of Mexican islands\nAnd one of the island tests of prison colony that's exciting\n[noise] ah it's got a hundred and twenty five miles per hour winds are high waves are affecting the beaches there will be like a hurricane can blowed out of prison\nNo I I don't think so but it's just exciting for them to to the prisoners get to watch to see the island what if the island just goes under out how bad can go can those guys bake considering what they tolerate in Mexico\nOh in a prison ... with the drug cartels right I mean the drug cartels run the whole country who ends up getting in prison what do you have to do for you end up at a Mexican prison ooh yeah and I don't know\nThey they were very odd system of trials remember we covered that would demand that killed his wife yeah in Mexico and it took months for a decision remember that the strange\nPass to get there to rise not similar to what we do here you always told me that you liked the British system where like both sides work together to find the truth I always like that [noise]\nYeah I mean not that I've ever seen a British trial up close but it seemed like that that that's the idea that was a more on a system that there's this idea where both uh you know the defense allies like held to confuse the stupid some the jury just seems like really ... ... dumb\nSystem and they all stand behind this idea well yes it's a it's a jury of peers you know it's a it's a very traditional and it's the best is that like this is not the best system possible no I mean we've seen it over and over again I had no way did you have any idea as a kid how bad it was\nThat everything they taught us about the justice system was just a load of crap [laughter]\nIt's based on how we went to trial seeds of human nature yeah and he can't understand modern life like this they can't understand DNA silence complex business law and and the complex medical and psychological problems that\nThey get to buy a fancy talker yeah you know open the door to the you know mark and mark Garrett Ghost World yeah but he largely loses anyway\nIt's got to think of it that's how bad they lost the Peterson case I Know because they lost that other case involving the guy that took bribed some contract remember the defense contractor who also he's lost his watch a lot of cases uh yes I he sees the fast track to death row\nAh according to the a meteorologist who are looking at a hurricane Willa it'll probably miss\nThe migrants caravan likely a ... there there are too far east to feel the direct effects of hurricane Wilma it's coming in of course on the Pacific on the western side of Mexico if they take the shortest route which\nIs up towards Texas they could see some rain but we understand they're they're headed for the one they're headed for your ... for the California border is what I what I understand they're trying to do\nIf they take a western track and head for the California border they will have to deal with what the storm left behind because remember there walking largely we're not going to take another month to month and a half for them to get to the California Boy we've got fourteen miles of fence on our side\nOr we do yeah yeah didn't they fortify send you see drop and yeah they were they were rebuilding sense that's right that's\nBeen up since the mid nineties now that you know they're going to go to the office right and tried to claim asylum but I think they should just shut the off the stores and sad nobody home out of business yeah counter [laughter] it's like an actual downtown El Paso I always bring up where nobody's home\nIt says here though they may have to move through a wind damage and washed out roads on their journey but likely 'cause I'm looking at the hurricane map and it does move across the country towards the Texas state but as far north of them she thought I heard that the the the caravan is way down there\nIs one in particular the whole scam is like really clear to me the whole scam is that the activists are going to tell the media these are desperate people who else would walk for weeks and weeks a thousand miles less they were desperately poor\nAnd then in the real story is the left is who are selling the message have financed these people so they could take a walk for six weeks they so they can charge the thousand miles and get bad and they're given water and they're given the change of clothes so\nThey could keep going and make a political points on behalf of the leftist organizations that this is all you know a paid for scam it's a racket\nAnd as you said ... Carter said yesterday reporting for us the most of these are young guys that families is not women and children it's young guys they're desperate situation some of them are here", "year": "2018", "show_name": "John and Ken", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "23"}
