{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "Some of the audio from the debate because we're pretty sure most of you missed any of the Monday what what else would you have to do\nWhat is it this is a great story to illustrate something that I have my hand feeds my aunt uh we were talking earlier in the show that California has become this futile society but the very poor in the very wealthy the small amount of wealthy people but man they control so much wealth that when they were capital gains drops new taxes\n... we're in trouble and then we have a twenty five percent or more the poverty rate so John Cox has been trying to point that out in the race or trying to saying well Gavin Newsom kind of represents these very wealthy elite liberal democratic progressive\nWhich has a stranglehold on our government and they feel isolated from the problems in terms of well you know a little more taxes I make a billion dollars what's the big deal is homeless people I'm dumb sheltered from them and and the crime on my mind you know my son\nSo now we take all the way across the country the New York state\nWhere obviously there were a wealthy people wants one place in the New York area where a lot of wealthy people hanging out [noise] that would be the Hamptons out on Long Island where a lot of celebrities have homes a lot of wealthy people go there they somewhere in the Hamptons it's a classic thing to do\nAnd there's another problem that President Trump amplified that's going on in Long Island a problem we're all familiar with the NS Thirteen gang member\nScourge Marcel Patricia from El Salvador yeah so are are they are among the nastiest\nGangs and the world despite the fact that the wealthy think that they want to isolate themselves from all the problems whether it's a crime or high taxes or\nThis story and the New York post is about how residents of the Hamptons or building luxurious panic rooms in case they have to hide from MS Thirteen

Bond carried\nOh it's done he ran for governor didn't you Jon Katz is kept him ... ... ...\nYeah but what we I interviewed and I think so yeah he he ran for mayor of New York my wife prefers the shotgun anyway why\nThey are so shaken up over concerns that the vicious MS Thirteen gang is too close for comfort because members of the gang massacred for young men behind a soccer field in central islip and April three months later a Hampton bays rubble rated by police was found to be tagged with an M is Thirteen game\nAnd a couple of years ago a man with him MS Thirteen connections broke into a South Hampton home and sexually assaulted a woman\nI forget what town this happened but they also might have happened in ah Maryland area they chopped up two sixteen year old girls would be says and left their body parts in the woods oh to raping and murdering them\nOh yeah they they it it it's it's obscene so Savage violence that they commit\nHome security businesses are taken off one
