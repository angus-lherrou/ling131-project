yes it's what do you think we're six yeses\nYeah the propositions I disagree with one of them wait a minute wait a minute or just talking about prop six ... six of which we have at the top of the voter guide it's out of order because there's only one thing you do an election day you vote yes on prop six the gas in the car tax repeal\nAs rewrite we'd been waiting for this for well over a year now in the day is finally coming we have to make this happen\nAnd of course it is a constitutional amendment so we get to vote in all future gas and car taxes that they've proposed because in in this context today the Sacramento beat\nHas the story how fighting climate change will raise California gas prices even higher now this isn't new to the Johnny can't show in our listeners recovered this big time but a year ago right after they pass the gas in the car tax the next thing they did was they passed the climate change tax\nOr whatever you want to call it but it's another gas tax and this was to affect what they believe is going to be big changes in California's climate emissions but all it is is it's going to raise your gas prices it's not going to change anything in the atmosphere at all and if it's gotten it could be up to sixty three cents a gallon\nOver the next three years right the sec be puts it this way\nConsiderably less fanfare the state's air pollution agencies and acted a regulation that will raise gas prices as much as thirty six cents a gallon by twenty thirty and diesel by forty four cents now in this story there only crediting right now you are high price of gas from this carbon tax\nAt ten to twelve cents a gallon\nBut it's going up it's going to go up incrementally for years in years because they voted and do nothing do absolutely I make no difference right 'cause California's too tiny to make any difference in the world right\nIt's hard for the a bone headed ego maniac idiots in Sacramento to understand this but we're a tiny little speck on the planet\nAnd once again gas prices are headed towards four dollars a gallon in most places\nWe know where you live and may not be but uh and we're talking about enough to\nThe ... the gas stations that charge like five dollars a gallon because they don't really care if you\nIf you buy their gas we're talking about if you really look around you know the average price right is getting your four

which sounds kind of I blazing\nBut buried in here and there's some good stuff in your explains exactly how few taxpayers are holding the stayed up from financial ruin three\n[laughter] it mentions a a ZIP Code like Palo Alto it's nine for three or one that ZIP Code and a handful of other affluent ZIP codes will determine California's financial fate we're not going to you you have to get to page Thirteen\nWhere the good stuff is so there's the stories they talk to people that live in Palo Alto in places where the rich people are in Silicon valley but listen to this the vulnerability stems from the states lopsided reliance on the personal income tax including taxes on capital gains to fund the budget\nNearly Seventy percent of California's revenue comes from personal income tax according to the legislative animals office okay do we start with that Seventy percent of the Sacramento revenue comes from just the personal income tax think of all the other ... and I know that the sales tax sent it to the gas to act with your number one in the country\nAnd and total all the other taxes only account for thirty percent\nOf the overall hall at Sacramento takes in\nThat share has steadily risen since the Nineteen fifties\nAnd personal income tax revenues especially concentrated among the state's top earners in twenty sixteen\nThe top one percent of the states ... paid more than paid about forty six percent of the total income tax revenue\nOkay so think about the two tracks to this Seventy percent of the money they get statewide is coming from the income tax and nearly half of that is coming from ... the one percent top five dollars right isn't that mind blowing which means which means thirty five percent\nAll the money is coming from one percent of the tax filing yeah and what happens if they have a really bad year or two\nAnd most of them we lunge coming from stock sales yeah they got out of Iraq and they keep the profits that's where the capital gains are\nAnd ... the year that the stock market takes a dump and it it will take a dump maybe soon because the record eyes you know how this goes nope but it's not going to be Trump's fault but it's going to take a don't\nRemember the dot com boom that was a great example\nNot Jerry Brown's been better if there's some Gray Davis was I got to say that Gray Davis was an idiot he gave up those pension deals remember all that in Nineteen Ninety nine as he was in the legislature went along with it and then we crashed and we were running big deficits and then we bring them out of office Jerry Brown's tried to put a little bit of way and that's why you hear about the surplus in the rainy day fund but believe me\nIf the stock market really really dives California will have another big deficits situation they mentioned back in twenty twelve an example when Facebook went public\nThe resulting surging capital gains revenue injected at least one point four billion dollars in revenue directly associated with the ... and the next three years thinking about that one company goes public and it's almost a billion and a half dollars in tax money comes into Sacramento\nThat's the very thin ice we're we're walking on the articles trying to point out that again whatever happens with the state's next governor a lot will depend on what happens to this a one percent of ... and\nTheir financial fate here's an example of what could happen and this is from the non partisan legislative analyst office a mild recession in California would be forty billion dollar decline in revenue or twenty billion dollar deficit\nA moderate recession slash revenues by eighty billion of forty billion dollar deficit and there's no rainy day fund or savings account that's going to handle that kind of craft show no\nI'd probably want to hear them running around in Sacramento oh we're in a surplus would spend the money on the poor people or whatever else they want to do which is going to get a bigger hole guy told you're already hundreds of billions of dollars of long term debt and I'm planning for that imagine when we have this big recession how much just trying to keep up with the year's spending is

I mean there there that the story is true as far as her involvement in this research paper\nAbout hypnosis yeah whether she used it to retrieve a fake memory of her getting attacked by Brett Kavanaugh there's no evidence of that were big believers in evidence there was this article doesn't say that either just says though there were accusations that Ford was under hypnotic trends during her testimony\n... little ... that that's what I'm saying they caught him merged emerged in right wild speculation All right so here this is from the federal is or someone in Shawn Davis and it says Blasey Ford\nCoauthored an academic study that's cited the use of hypnosis as a tool to retrieve memories and traumatized patience\nThe academic paper and we're not making this up is entitled meditation with yoga group therapy with hypnosis and psycho education for long term depressed mood a randomized pilot trial\nIt's a study that tested the or\nAdvocacy advocacy of certain treatments in forty six depressed individuals and it was published by the journal of clinical psychology in May of two thousand and eight so the paper by Ford and several other co authors focused on whether various techniques including hypnosis alleviate depression whether you could use hypnosis\nAh therapeutically to assist in the retrieval of important memories and listen to this create artificial situations to assist in treatment\nAnd that's the one that got everybody well up yeah artificial situations like some believe the cabinet accusation is yeah you you wonder since she's a researcher\nYou know how much she bought into this\nOr whether she experimented on herself because it is self hypnosis that that ah that is one of the factors here right but I never said many testimony we know of that you know says to get her mowing which nobody asked her because nobody knew about this in fact she said it's haunted her her whole life so she wouldn't need hypnosis she's always said that she\nCould not get this out of her mind she told me to share it with anybody so she just conveniently forgot all the details that could help a robbery story no she doesn't run home put her diary\nA forged papers cited a controversial Nineteen sixty four study on the use of hypnosis to treat alcoholics\nAnd her paper claimed hypnosis could be used to improve or poor in the therapeutic relationship system the retrieval of important memories ... artificial situations that were permit the client to express ego dice sonic emotions in a safe manner wow\nThey used self hypnosis to treat their randomize sample of patience\nAnd it goes on to a more ... more ... I I've never seen the phrase ego die static\nNo and she dropped a few\nAnd it's not known whether she underwent hypnotic therapy because she and her attorneys have refused to provide detailed notes from therapists\nThey gave portions to the Washington Post\nAnd remember in uh the original notes from the first therapist\nIt didn't mention the name Kavanaugh at all and it also claimed that four boys had raped her right and then that change and then she blamed it on the therapists taking bad notes so um\nI I doubt if she's refusing to provide therapists notes\nUh then um you have to wonder what kinds of treatments he's trying to hide it she feels would open her to a ridicule when they're dry leaf confidential well yeah but you just made public and a ruined another guy's wife so you don't get any more privacy here\nAnd I I mean I Hope the FBI starts are questioning about their this hypnotic stuff\nLike when we come back we'll be talking to Andrew Mullen back from KFI news he was covering this news conference which began about an hour ago\nA which is talking about and arrest or maybe more than one in these breaking a robberies and to the homes of famous people including us feel pretty good the Dodgers and Robert Woods with the LA Rams unreal anyway they have a they have news on that front we'll talk about\nNext with him John and can show Deborah mark has more care if I Am six forty\nK pacify them less and I already have\nRevealed on Deborah Martin live on the KFI twenty four hour news round like Johnny can't talk to about ... have been arrested for a series of burglaries targeting the labs and athletes\nInvestigator said the crew hit homes of Riyad al ... and Robert Woods LAPD captain ... says the suspected gang members knew when the homes were empty\nVictims home had been selected based on social media posts things and touring what travel schedules of the owners\nShe says the burglars went right to the bedroom and left with the loot in a few minutes\nWatches jewelry designer person another luxury items\nShe says the group had a list of more than a dozen new targets adorable and back KFI now in\nAndrew will have much more on this with John and can after the news California's voter registration has hit an all time high secretary\nOf state Alex the DEA reports more than Nineteen million people are registered to vote with nearly Seventy six percent eligible to hit the polls in November that's a new record California hasn't hit those numbers since the Nineteen Ninety six presidential election\nOfficials say more people are turning away from the two major political parties and registering as no party preference and but he didn't give an explanation for the registration boost but the state did implemented program this year that allows people to sign up at the DMV deadline to register to vote is October twenty second Monica ...
