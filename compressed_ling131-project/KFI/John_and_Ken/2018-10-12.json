us stealing our money\nWe need you to tell your friends yes on the gas tax repeal don't be fooled by the ballot title no that is the product is tax repeal you have to go yeah and that's why\nWe're being very very creative with our marketing or they get that uh or to cry and and to make sure that people do that there's an error on the ballot they gotta they gotta look carefully at what they're about to vote on and if they they'll notice that prop thick\nAppeal road repairs it actually repeal the gas tax\nYeah the bullets weren't wanted to ask you what can our listeners do\nIn order to try to have an effect\nOn this obviously what you're doing with the mailer and the robo call is certainly going to help spread the word but what can your average person listening do to help\nWell the most important thing they can do is they can take their email and go into their address book and copy all their friends that they do live in California and put on the subject line error on your ballot or\nCarefully read crops that and then in the message tight and say you should vote yes on prop because the gas tax repeal that's all you need to do a simple email\nWill do the trick a also tell your

think it was around thirty percent we're still on shore on ... even when they were read deceptive lying language from the ballot title in summary let me ask you this did you did you challenge that when you saw that coming months ago\n[noise] no because we we know the case law the Howard German taxpayers association is our partner and they handle a legal fight and ah we decided that given a past court decision\nThat that the justices of the Supreme Court in California\nWho are pretty left leaning they weren't going to challenge the politician\nRight and so we knew that we would have to make sure that we made as much noise as possible and drew attention to that now I Will tell you I then I didn't mention this yesterday a or shy on Wednesday when I was on but\nI have a mall in now on the campaign oh yeah and they they had a a a a a coalition call with Governor brown on a Wednesday and they're panicking because\nThey said that the mailer and the robocalls and the immediate attention is starting to show and their whole\nOh good they are now a running neck and neck with us again in their own internal polling they say that this is now a coin toss it could go either way and they're now panicking and that shows\nThe power of the people and the people start talking to each other and emailing each other and calling each other and telling their friends around the dinner table that that is more powerful than millions of dollars in TV ads and that's why we need people to actually get engaged getting this cafe\nAbsolutely All right Carl thanks for coming on again a good job with the

last night into today major projects at risk if voters kill California gas tax hike comma officials say\nThis story is unbelievable Chicken Little more than four hundred transit infrastructure projects would be jeopardized if California's gas tax hike gets killed in November we plan shelled construction frozen in place and millions of taxpayer dollars polarized she actually used the word vaporized according according to officials well\nYet with state and transportation agencies buried in the article when you find it later on and Carl does a little talking\nYou will see this is the part where it gets very tricky but they've done a good job raking in all of your gas tax money and using it for other purposes because it's a gold mine they do this and other places\nOr for instance in New York City area we have to pass bridges and tunnels to get new Manhattan and they charge an outrageous amount for that they siphoned off that money for mass transit\nBecause there's really not a lot of expense\nTo maintaining highways in rows there is not\nGet out of my close at the end of the day and not smell smoke [noise]\nI Would tell anybody who's even considering to try the

continues including four\nCases in willow Brooke you didn't wear will broke his all explain all this coming up after the news it's three o'clock the typhoon zone has come this is what it's about\nThirty stinking problem that can't be cleaned up please everywhere with type ... uh you know it's been a year since the Harvey Weinstein ... story broke which led to the me too movement and then that got amped up again with the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing\nThis was going to want to leave a lot of nutty people it just has to and you know this belief\nOr they're with or without that many women\nAre afraid to declare that they've been sexually assault leads us to this story but that wasn't the case however was this woman sexually assaulted it comes from New York City oh Brooklyn all day go dig as like a little corner grocery store so this lady you're going to hear\nOn this audio her name is Teresa ... she's at the counter something called the Sahara daily market Flatbush, Brooklyn and she buying two bags of cat litter that ought to be a tip off\nBut you can't let her DNA now many cats do you have at home well apparently she's convinced that while she was waiting in line for behind was grabbed by a boy I think it's a ... a nine year old boy\nAnd that leads to someone whipping up the phone because she decides that she's going to call the police on this kid let's roll this Facebook video\nMother and I think\nThat and I was going to show crowd\n\nCome the little share brushed up against as strong as what we call it totally\nAnd\nFine or a no brainer\nWell no no no\nNo they don't then I'll tell you what I'm saying that what you can't\nBut I don't know why you know I don't mind\nHere's why step in and try to\nSort through this madness first of all this has gone viral and the social justice warriors are leading the charge because the nine year old is a black child and this is a white woman and it's assumed that she's racist because she thinks she got her but pinched by a nine year old black child probably because he was a black child\nI think we're talking about a ... person and not necessarily a racist person it turns out when they took a closer look at the surveillance video the kids backpack Russia's against her\nBut you know here's the vacuum were caught in today in the Netherlands ... whatever it is it's probably just a crazy person he could have been a white kid or anybody where she just overreact\nBecause she's loopy but they will play this war there it is racist\nShe's just assuming 'cause he's a nine year old black child that he would do something like this and that's why they're yelling at her and trying to shame or and she's kind of fighting back but she's kind of nuts and I go back to the cat litter\nThat's all I Need to explain their so that's my objection to this even though it was kinda funny that she's that worked up over a backpack brushing up against her but\nVery sensitive but the the I mean there's no proof that she did this and thought this just because the child was black\nIt could've been a different story to different person that rubs up against or an Asian kid a Latino kid a white kid and she's probably not enough to believe that you just got sexually assaulted I mean I think that in the realm of possibility but that's left out in today's crazy world and viral videos right when we come back we're going I don't think he's in the typhoon zone but Andrew mama back\nIt's got the story on the downtown LA type this outbreak which by the way it spread to Pasadena\nLong Beach now will overall which isn't a neighbor of the one the one oh five freeways if you're not\nFamiliar with that and the plan that the city of LA has to clean up Skid Row and to do something about the typhoon zone so we're going in and talking about it next with the health and science this year the Johnny Ken showing KFI debris Marquez the news now\nThink about all the way you

KFI news\nA ballot measure proposes a change in tactics for treating mental illness and homeless people\nAnd really there's just no way to keep up with it\nAnd I don't envy the job that he was doing a but he just said oh there's so much to eat for rats or any other stray animals because you know I guess we focus on the rats but you know the health department to is saying and it's it can be any wild animals that are running around there and a number of people on Skid Row have pets too\nAnd so any animal can can also be part of the spread of this\nYou know well it's not a coincidence that at least the outbreak in the typhoon zone is right around Skid Row there\nIt's it's related to the homeless problem because if the homeless people don't have a home then they don't have the trash can and they don't have trash pickup so they're just throwing all their stuff everywhere and like you said if they are pets or their rats come by\nAnd the fleas hop on them into the fleas hop on the people and boy the way it's transmitted from the fleas you can either be bitten by the fleet or\nFleece feces can be rubbed into your country scrapes in your skin that's how you can track the or the typists when it from the fleas itself it's a bacteria that the fleas are infected with and they pass it on to you when they bite you or\nYou get your their poop inside your body or you like a little bit freaked out worried about fleas hopping on you\n[laughter] I I haven't really checked I should probably grab a shower would I get home but\n... of of course the for us to take away today was that ... the health department says it's not just downtown LA and in some of the other places here and there but now it's an ... broken for cases that were not homeless individuals\nAnd that now we're actually starting to see the numbers this year become higher than the average since we're still in October and for whatever reason or the total number of cases of really about doubled uh from five years ago\nDoes it bother them at all I mean typists does occur every year but this seems like a big red jumping the numbers is this does it bother anybody to say you know what we've got to get a handle on this homeless problem because then as you said most of the cases right now from the Skid Row area we gotta we gotta do something I mean we can clean up\nAnd because it's coming from the fleas but it's related to the entire listen debris problem\nI don't know how much bother I have observed or you just mentioned that the mayor just put out an email statement\nA little while ago this afternoon and you heard that conversation I had with him earlier in the week at the health department didn't seem overly concerned because you know this is not typhoid something entirely different right are more likely to die from it right right and and really it's even a coin flip if you need some sort of hospital medical treatment\nAs so they don't they don't seem overly concerned I think ah from the perspective of the mayor it's more of an optics one is that the people do know how it looks down at a downtown on Skid Row and you see all the trash there and then you hear about an outbreak and maybe there's some panic about isn't going to spread to my neighborhood and\nUh you know he's saying that he's ordered the sanitation department to really get on it with this backlog but\nI guess we haven't heard from public officials any way a great deal of concern or fear about what's going on course relates to the normal or they want to downplay everything dealing with problems this is like third world nonsense alright\nThank you Andrew for that report got have you back from can't find news reporting of downtown LA and the tight this outbreak in the typhoon zone and then of course when we come back we'll

under normal circumstances well Facebook users to navigate away from the site while remaining logged in\nThat allowed the attack to occur to gave hackers the ability to in effect to take over Facebook

twenty minutes\nOkay Hi\nCounty and I already on the\nRise I'm Deborah Martin live from the camps like twenty four hour newsroom health officials in LA county have reported more than sixty cases of typing\nLike being in a in a bomb a bombed out area uh and now having seen it from the air getting that big picture taking the look at everything that happened I got to tell you it's again I'm almost speechless I could tell you that there are houses that\nSimply do not exist any or you can tell that anything was to bring there's nothing like that except a slab of concrete with the house was\nThe rest of the house apparently wash completely out this by the storm surge and the question comes up in your mind how in the world through all this devastation you you take a look at it how the world could any one I've survived\nYeah that's a obviously we still don't have a complete picture of how many people were killed them is I'm seeing a number tonight I'm sixteen so far from hurricane Michael I don't know if you have an update on that and also well with these\nBuildings need from I mean if you live in in Florida maybe not the panhandle so much you you've got to be expecting there could be a devastating hurricane was there anything that they could do construction wise to to stand up to this\nWell yes and a matter of fact they have done that in two thousand one after Hurricane Andrew went through the Nineteen nineties they instituted what's called the Andrew code it's a building code among the strictest in the nation and among the the coming up to this code\nYou have to build a home and the windows in that home to withstand where we have a hundred and fifty miles an hour so the newer homes built after two thousand one we're built to this code and I can tell from looking at it from above\nThis code word I could see the newer houses they\nStood up to this the older houses however the older buildings the apartment the\nOffices they looked like somebody had ram their fist through these structures that were just completely blown out and it's so remarkable or a way to the effect of this kind of a strict code\nSomething I thought of today ... when I was listening to reports on is that people their homes were wiped out their workplaces were wiped out I kept thinking well what are they doing right now I mean they're trying to rebuild their lives maybe they're just searching through the rubble but it's hard for them I mean what what what are they doing with their time there\nI don't think it's ... I got to be honest with you I was talking about this this morning and I'm really kind of ... I hear from people what happened they give me the the list of things they'll let me here's what happened to me this this is not working this was\nDestroyed or my you know this this is the effect of my life in terms of income or I Can't find food\nTerrible stories but you can get a sense that they're just kicking off the bullet points they don't seem to have yet to observe toward the emotional impact of this how badly they feel about what happened and how afraid they are for what will happen in the future they don't crash but yet the people I've spoken with\nThey're really just dealing with a moment to moment details it I think it's only when things slow down a little bit that they're going to have a second to think my God my life has really changed\nDramatically because this won't fall\nOf our time when hurricane my little trouble\nOr you have a little problem with the phone number ... let me ask you this do you mean our stereotype living here in California of the Florida Panhandle is that it's it's a poor population of Florida and there's a lot of trailers so we can only imagine the extra devastating impact in hand if those things I just sent her a true is it\nYes it is a there are a lot of poor buildings that just did not make it up talking about the older structures wooden structures a and a lot of of\nHomes and offices that were built before two thousand one where they address what into effect I worry every year to you that having seen as pro the air and seeing the newer homes to survive and the older homes that didn't Viagra code or something I think we all should consider when when it comes time to to build our next structure\nI but I've heard I mean it's still true anymore and I see in this story they do people still live in trailers they were the death toll way too with the whole Landrieu thing\nNow there are still people who live in trailers that ironically the trailers are people who live in the trailers but I talk to their newer trailers they too were both to withstand pretty ... and most of them but once the priest get when they fell down most of them seem to fare fairly well\nThat's that's absolutely amazing I Would guess you know you have a trailer it's really built into the ground I mean people think of a trailer that they looked at the back of their car but these kind of mobile homes that people have sometimes they're really you know foundation wise they're stuck into the ground are All right\nWell ... thanks for that report I appreciate it\nSorry for the phone call and thanks for having me\nI did speak combs ABC News for can't find Florida and a satellite phone 'cause obviously communications are still an issue where he is in the Florida Panhandle getting an eye on the destruction a few things to pass along\nThis category for hurricane was the first to make landfall in the panhandle since recordkeeping began in the you're Eighteen fifty one\nRight and it was a hundred and fifty five miles per hour that's when they got it in his strongest when it hit land a lot of pressure nine hundred and nine in the middle of bars minimum pressure in the eye of the hurricane the peak storm surge they said it was between nine feet in fourteen feet from a place called Mexico beach\nEast to a Appalachia day according to the hurricane center three hundred and Seventy five thousand people in Florida were born to evacuate elected not\nIncluding two hundred and five people in Mexico beach where Michael made landfall\nAnd uh they had to help a number of people on the coastline but the only and the power outages I mean so over a million customers in Georgia Florida Alabama and South Carolina\nAnd or the latest figure I saw a for the death toll a lot of people were hit by trees either inside a Homer outside I was about sixteen is what I'm reading up but they're still obviously a long way to go before they can finalize anything like that I'm more coming up on the Johnny Ken she'll but right now here's your chance at
