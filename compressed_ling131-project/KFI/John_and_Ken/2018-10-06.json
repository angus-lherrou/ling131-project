nobody was sure our are going to vote announced their positions one of them is Susan Collins a Republican\nFrom Maine who went along speech before the Senate chamber announced she would vote for judge capital that was a log she went on and on about the me too movement sex assault and blah blah blah blah blah you know I've covered you know this this is a big crossroads here\nBecause I personally am not believing anybody just 'cause they say so anymore I I think we now they should they have weaponized really didn't believe you just 'cause she say so and you should they've they've turned the me too movement into a weapon against men\nAnd they did it to Brett Kavanaugh and I think now that maybe this maybe everything about this was fabricated\nAnd this was just the nuclear weapon they had lying in wait and they thought if they just\nAnnounced that there was some kind of sexual assault that would be enough for him to go running they figure that Republicans would be a bunch of cowards and generally they are\nAnd that they wouldn't have to go through with testifying and that's why they held off on testifying for so long this thing because really date they probably never expected that are that the republic would say oh yeah well let's hear a story\nIt's like oh shoot because\nKnow ... so much for story now it's been proven to be false there was no claustrophobia there was no a
