we talked about this the whole chemical sensitivity thing that'll hold it was\nIt seemed like it was all part of the sensitive movement back in the day when a it's not that long ago actually it was you know the idea of a school children their self esteem is important so you started with the fuzzy math and out of this also came to chemical sensitivity I think it\nIt came right after what was that a strange malady that some people had that made them feel oh Epstein Barr\nMember that oh yeah oh that was hard to vet you that's part of mano right\nYou know there was a range for a while people were always run down you just wonder if they were just you know there was something real Barrows is just some sort of chronic depression that seem to be taking hold their health and then\nThat was quickly followed by this chemical sensitivity thing believe me I understand because I've run into people that were too much perfume or they were too much cologne better but I think there are some people are

talking about the wild weather it's Southern California just over the past several days the lightning on friday taken its toll within today crazy when wreaking havoc [noise]\nTo take it a couple of lives you've probably heard Deborah just mentioned that Paul Allen the co founder of Microsoft has passed away at the age of sixty five was what ... are non Hodgkin's lymphoma right\nAnd I guess he had that will he announced so many he had so many years ago nine years ago and uh it came back\nSo okay I did not know he had been ill with anything or for the record do pick cynical pool for Paul Allen for the year twenty Eighteen ... pool picks but it's one of the big stories this afternoon and I think you know the ... had an interest in sports teams up there in the Seattle area he left\nMicrosoft not that many years after he cofounded it be ... with them and uh got involved and other things are of course that's Bill Gates has company a Microsoft um\nTook him up after four o'clock all talking about the weather we've been talking about the big ones are of course ground zero for all this and California's the city of San Francisco story after story has come out\nAnd there's even an app to help you find the feces snap crap you probably heard about that by now but they have problems\nWith drug use all over the place\nThere is a proposal that the activists gun on the ballot in San Francisco this is similar any different than the attempt in Seattle\nTo raise money to combat homelessness proposition C will raise six three hundred million dollars a year that's about double what San Francisco already spins to fight homelessness\nA one of the\nTech people who spoke out in front of a rather in favor of this is a guy by his ... his name is Mark Bittman off founder of cloud computing Julian\nOf course he's lived in San Francisco was family has for generations it's the worst it's ever been he said nobody should have to live like this they don't need to live like this we can get this under control he's supporting the measure and uh he says his company would pay an additional ten million dollars a year if it passes\nBecause the way this is going to work it's a little different than San Francisco the tax would be levied mostly by revenue\nI think in in Seattle they were going to do it by the number of employees and then of course has faded for now an average half percent tax increase on companies revenue above fifty million dollars a year and it was put on the ballot by\nThe activists was not put on the ballot by the city government in San Francisco and in fact the mayor of San Francisco we just took office recently London Breed she became mayor when the previous mayor passed away and then she got elected I think this year in June\nAnd she's against it because she doesn't she says I don't think there's enough controls over how this money is going to be spent and I think\nIt's a little hard to believe this was coming from a San Francisco politician but that's a lot of times what happens with this I mean we go over the numbers sometimes it's hard to believe\nHow much money is spent to quote combat homelessness but the problem is several facets to it a lot of it is because a lot of it is spent on a bureaucratic workforce\nSome of which are effective a lot of which are not effective in actually reaching the homeless people on the streets and then there's a percentage of homeless people in the streets but don't want your help write\nI write their out of their minds they like living on the streets they don't want to live under the rules they like their drugs on their alcohol you're not going to take me into a place where I have to get clean have to live by rules\nAnd it seems like that population has grown in the last several years of ... seven which was passed four years ago it is really a big factor in that because there's no consequences to drug use behavior\nSo there is a little battle going on as I mentioned the sales force EEO mark Bennett off is in favor of this but Twitter in square CEO Jack Dorsey is against the tax\nAnd he thinks they should leave it up to the mayor to come up with a better plan than this business tax\nWhich is going to put a half a percent on this this is gross receipts above fifty million dollars a year San Francisco spent three hundred and eighty million of its ten billion dollar budget last year on services related to homelessness and sometimes if you could ever\nGet a good handle on the number of homeless and then you do the math you realize how much they're spending per person on homelessness I think we did this a couple of times in the city of LA and these ideas to house people like in downtown LA with that trailer encampment that they built a house like forty five people but they spent millions\nOn on on building that's because there's a group of people forget is there is an entire bureaucracy behind this\nGovernment workers or some of these the charitable organizations that they have to hire as middlemen all this money has to be spent in every different direction and often so it was almost like a the comparison to the school budget\nI'm much money actually reaches the classroom\nI got all these superintendents and you've got all his management in between and any\nTeachers oh actually there's a couple of bucks for kids in the classroom so we'll see what happens\nUp there are because the tech guys are disagreeing about this bill office plunged at least two million dollars from company in personal resources for this tax to pass in San Francisco he claims there's a report from the city's chief economist which says if it passes\nIt will likely reduce homelessness will resulting in a net loss of just nine hundred jobs but it's only point one percent of all jobs\nBut we'll see if people put their money where their mouth is and I I\nYou know the to me the problem was more hardcore than just throwing more money at it you have to deal with a lot of things like are consequences to people's actions\nBy coming up next the wild California weather will get into that we'll also talk about Trump's appearance on sixty minutes Johnny
