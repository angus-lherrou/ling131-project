candidates\nFive o'clock hour Monday November fifth if you're running one eight hundred and five to zero one five three four if a market down are passing on to someone you know that is running for office you get thirty seconds on the joined can show to make your case of a socialist always want to\nRent control and periodically they got\nThey make a move uh in order to artificially hold down rents because they don't think it's fair that the owners of apartment buildings are homes are condominiums raised rent a depending on what the market is\nUh and uh if you rent an apartment or a single family home or condominium uh anything built after Nineteen Ninety five you're generally I'm generally those buildings are not subject to rent control law yeah\nProposition ten would repeal something called the Costa Hawkins rental Housing Act\nThat's a state law that prohibits cities and counties from imposing most new forms of rent control including on single family homes or apartments bill dance in Nineteen Ninety five so if this thing passes local governments will be free to put it in a new restrictions on ...\nIt really does cause all kinds of mayhem we're now going to talk to a spokesman\nFor no on ... they're against this idea of allowing a rent control this has become one of the most expensive campaigns in state history total fundraising has over a hundred million dollars Steve vaguely or Steve what John again show\n[noise] grading I think this is living proof that ... o'clock or off right twice a day\nYeah yeah we go or health for us over [laughter] wow that too I think we do know people you and long been on the Democratic side and you were a spokesman for Gray Davis back during the recall days we had got quite a battle going on that\nThose were the days but\nYou know looking at the list of people behind prop ten we thought you'd be on the other side how did this happen yeah yeah I figured your you'd be on an ardent socialist well\nYou know this is the only thing I think having a Tesla that John Cox Gavin Newsom agree on that's how bad prop Janet\nOkay well then tell us how bad it is [laughter] okay\nAs you athlete described it it's bad for homeowners in particular because\nIt would force you to get government approval anytime you want it to raise the rent on your own property if you're on the single family home or LA county supervisor Sheila kill already said if prop ... passes this was going to be tops of her agenda I think that's a bad idea\nA we know what happens when that happens people take their homes off the market completely it gets to that makes matters worse for renters because they'll have a less to choose from and more to pay for [noise]\nI I Would think it would take the incentive away from owners to invest in their properties are and like you said to to rent them out and to repair them to keep maintained properly because if yeah I mean it off it margin that you need to know why you know the people are gonna let places got out\nYeah there's multiple studies that have shown just that I'm not only does maintenance declined because clearly you can't get the return on investment you need to make the kind of I'm pretty much you want to make but it also\nThat results in neighboring properties losing their value in fact the nonpartisan legislative analysts sort of the referee on ballot measures said this would result in a decline of property values and that in turn means less tax revenue and that Geron means a lot of local government cuts to police and fire and things like that\nWould just do like new construction possibilities to for people who were planning to put up a building to rent out\nYeah for the very first time rent controlled could be applied to new construction which as you probably know means projects simply ... hensel out\nIt would also be applicable to affordable housing project so that was that actually are designed for low income families they'd be under records all those projects wouldn't pass a law that we've already seen examples around the state of projects being put on hold and canceled just with the threat of this thing pastor\nOr if the counties in the cities had the right to do rent control is there any limit on how much control they would have did they really are they are\nThis is carte blanche I'm One of the problems with is that enables not just local governments uh but local interest groups to put anything they want on the ballot having to deal with rancor Charles so they can be as radical as possible given example hearing in Sacramento where we have an entirely democratic\nMayor and city council there are get opposed to what these radical groups are putting on the ballot because they know what impact the construction of new affordable housing so you have radical activist groups putting things on the ballot that or even opposed by local whoever\n[noise] yeah I mean the last\nThing the state needs any uh any impediments to building new housing for everybody\nI mean there's all kinds of things we need to do to get more housing units up and this will just make matters worse\nHas this been tried to any great extent in in recent times I Know ... years ago there was there was rent control in various places but is there anything is broad based is what this could be\nYeah as you mentioned uh the you know she can still do rent control on buildings built before Nineteen Ninety five and in fact\nEr we saw the same amount you up in the bay area just adopt something about a year ago and guess what happens rent controlled apartments are being converted into condominiums I'm so those are people that were living in those thing I've lost our house so that's what happens people take their units off the market and they can burn 'em to condos to escape the government regulation\nYeah I I you know I remember growing up on the east coast New York city you rent control is a big deal people were praising and\nThought it was a wonderful thing or a way to put them not to get caught\nBy such a high rear end result yeah if you were living in your apartment for forty years\nWell yeah no I actually a relative that had a place in Brooklyn and I lived there for a while and she said oh yeah I'm going to keep it because it's rent control and I have to worry about getting too expensive for me [noise] All right Steve well they are coming on again as you say go ahead\nAnd I was gonna say yeah there's multiple stories of actors in New York City to make ten million dollars thanks hundred
