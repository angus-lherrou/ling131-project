convention Michelle Obama got up there and that famous line when they go low we go high\nYeah just what Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder I've given up on that Hillary Clinton will play first she did an interview with CNN and Eric Holder the former attorney general build a crowded Georgia over the weekend no when they go low we got a kick them\nWe're gonna talk to kick them but I tried to clarify that coming\nNuts saying the name where did he say where I Would and then he tried to clarify the remark don't do anything inappropriate hopefully they'll get that I Know it's really fun [laughter] they are frustrated with Trump they aren't just because he gave breeding them that keeps speeding telling you it's coyote road runner\nThey were worried that the civil tactics that they think some Democrats steak or not working\nWell the latest the latest uh acme package that blew up was this whole Brett Kavanaugh say yeah I Know it's a boy when they're ... that's right and the coyote has all black and to face with smoke coming out of his ears\nSo we'll talk about all that play some of the audio coming up and the five o'clock hour now they got the updates on the crash in upstate New York of the stretch limousine that crashed Eighteen people died in the limo including the driver and to ... to run a parking lot across the street\nA lot of attention now is turn to the owners of the limousine company called prestige limousine today they arrested the sooner the owner the son's name as now men Hussein\nThe owner of prestige limousine is showerhead Hussein ... they're looking for him but ... says he's in Pakistan because he's got some health problems oh Pakistan is where you go to to be healed\nThe owner ... head is apparently sixty two years old and man\nWhat a background he is headlined by this limo company owner in crash revealed his FBI informant recruiter of terrorists and a fraud stir and I want to focus on the last word there I guess a lot of fraud is that a word\nIt's the New York times it's out of the fraudsters are frauds stir I like that term\nHeard of it well you know what happened with this guy it says in two thousand and one at that time showerhead Hussein was forty five years old and a gas station owner he walked into the DMV in Albany New York and obtained a driver's license using fake documents for a would be taxi driver who paid them a grand\nAnd that apparently was the beginning of it he wanted to avoid deportation so then he became the FBI informant and he posed as a recruiter of terrorists but which allegedly led to breaking up a couple of plots but all along here in this story he continues to be and always has been a fraud stir which I think explains what happened with the limo\nWell wait a second ... did he already know terrorists or they thought he could play the role of a terrorist recruiter he played the role of the terrorists so they hired him and said hey there's a bunch of terrorists uh would be terrorists in this neighborhood why don't you go and see if you can recruit these\nI think they had tips and they knew about possible connections they didn't have any background being involved with it no I played a role\nOh I see I didn't know if they if he hadn't edited and they and they flipped him and they said look no jail if you help us get the other guys\nKnow so I think it was the fraudsters that they recruited and they ended up going to an Albany mosque any help convict a couple of the leaders of the mosque who had a plan to assassinate\nA Pakistani diplomats they're going to import a missile missile imported miss two thousand nine conspiracy to bump synagogues in the Bronx for other men were enticed\nBut all during this story you can see he continued to be a fraud stir\nWhich I think is the reason that these limousines didn't work very well and I think they didn't have breaks in fact the one that crashed failed the recent inspection in care guys like this don't care that's what I'm saying yeah you know you you know exactly you know exactly what this guy was\nYou know where they did business out of a low budget hotel north of Albany\nThat's where prestige limousine was proceeds what motel room sick say yeah I that's kind of what it was I feel sorry for these people but they were probably looking for a low cost limo\nAnd they went to the wrong gravity you don't want that that that is an oxymoron do not hire a low cost them out there now higher if you want a limo pay for pay pay the big money or a you know have a [noise]\nSee I think it has on buddy ... somebody as the two thousand one Ford Excursion was not supposed to be on the road it failed inspections including a test of its breaks and they're calling it a high energy impact\nThe limousines engine just drove right into the driver's side it just pushed right to the car into the driver's side and that obviously would kill the driver I kinda feel bad for the drivers widows been speaking because some people think he was driving recklessly but maybe one has to do with the roads it was kind of a downhill where he went to a stop sign I have a feeling the brakes and work\nAnd hopefully as kept he couldn't do anything about\nThe ... because he he'd he'd want even if it was driving recklessly he wanted slammed the brakes yeah there was no signs of getting my limit the damage yeah no that maybe they were going right\nAlright coming up next we'll take a look at the Johns favorite the return of Hillary Clinton oh my God also twenty twenty could be very entertaining there might be while there are it

of gun violence in that city\nUm there are a lot of feedback is coming in about this meeting that he took with Kanye West today the White House\nI don't mind him meeting I I was the more I think about it I don't like the ten minute tirade that are causing rant whatever they call it the con you went on and the president never stopped him\nRight he he which is so rare 'cause usually he's center stage and he just let Kanye go on and on and on\nUh I Know that somebody I don't know which columnist but there is a conservative columnist who says the president took advantage of Kanye West like took advantage of\nWhatever he's gone through yeah uh and that it was not if I don't know anyone you\nKnow you know what it kinda reminded me of is that Tom Cruise is appearance on Oprah after you make Katie Holmes that kind of energy at home on the ... going up and down kind of thing the same kind of thing back to some uh some strange science uh obesity\nJust under thirty percent of Americans aged Seventeen to twenty four\nAre not eligible to join the army because of obesity\nIs is is this is a crazy story this is a study undertaken by the military called mission readiness and\nWhat they're concerned about is the fatter our kids get the less likely they would be to qualify for military service if they choose to join the military\nAnd their suggestion is and I know a lot of people bucket this idea right away but their idea is institutionalized fitness and nutrition programs in schools to make sure that kids grow up\nHealthy and physically capable of protecting the country if it ever came to that\nBut people push back against well you know the teachers go tell my kid how to eat\nOkay but if you're given your kid you who all the time you there's going to be a day where the chickens will come home to roost on that dietary choice of yours they found that that twenty nine percent of young Americans who have a high school diploma no criminal record no chronic medical issue so\nThe third basically of people who would qualify if they choose to get into military\nSeventeen of them would be qualified and available for active duty and Thirteen percent of those would qualify be available and actually achieve a score on the armed forces qualification test\nIt's not just the obesity issue but it's also no not a willingness\nTo serve and it's just\nYou don't want to join the military anymore on the obesity issue they say though is particularly\nBad in the south and the army draws a large number of recruits from the south citadel the citadel of course the military college in South Carolina found that recruits in ten southern states had lower levels of physical fitness and were twenty two percent or twenty eight percent more likely to be injured during basic\nWow in twenty sixteen among sixteen to twenty four year olds in twenty sixteen Thirteen percent said they would be interested in joining the military two percent last year\nIn just one year it dropped by eighty percent it sounds like a mouse pups have come out uh with same sex parents\nYeah ah for the first time scientists said yesterday that they had bread mice with two genetic fathers\nSteering around biological hurdles that would otherwise prevent same sex parents from having offspring interesting now would do if you wanted to\nMake a baby with another man they could use both of your\nStuff your DNA and combine it\nUh I think what you're talking about is if I wanted to have mice with another man if I'm reading the research correctly\nBut I'm just saying if you were a mouse and us\nA mouse wanted to I'm assuming they're doing these studies on mice to see how they can do it on humans eventually\nI guess here's the weird part the mice with two genetic mothers matured into adults and we're able to have pups of their own mice with two fathers were the most part did not result in\nBirds the embryos that they created a none of the by paternal mouse pops those with the two genetic fathers none of those survive to adulthood\n... is that because there was no mother mothering figure\nOut at the\nUnited ...

twenty four hour news room at least six deaths have now been blamed on hurricane Michael in Florida Georgia in North Carolina the death in Georgia was an eleven year old girl killed by a tree that fell the storm headwinds of a hundred and fifty five miles an hour when it made landfall yesterday in Mexico Beach Florida\nBlock after block in the area it looks like a tornado hit the panhandle Florida governor Rick Scott says the focus now is on finding anyone who ignored evacuation orders and may be trapped\nWe have thirty five hundred for the national guard with more than one thousand high water vehicles Thirteen helicopters and sixteen votes for humanitarian assistance security operations and search and rescue\nAnd National Guard team got into Mexico beach overnight and found plenty survivors command hurt in an explosion in Boyle Heights is in critical condition LA city firefighter said that explosion this afternoon damage to homes there is structural damage to the walls and roofs as one while looks like a blue outward and there's damage to the inside of that home the cause\nOf the explosion is not yet known leaders in LA county have called out or proposed federal rule that would limit what benefits legal immigrants can use their ... said he says a change to the public charge rule could make it impossible for some people to get green cards and permanent residency\nPie use any small amount of assistance to keep your kids healthy to keep some house to keep children said\nThat you will no longer be welcome in the United states of America\nOr said he says the rule change could lead to a chilling effect on public health as immigrants stay away from doctors and hospitals the rule is under a sixty day public comment period merchants on all day or a street in downtown LA have taken issue with the mayor's claim about a nearby homeless shelter\nShop owners say the city's first temporary shelter has attracted more homeless people to the area different faces every day\nAnd we're surviving on stolen food probably getting water from irrigation systems attached to the local farms and ranches they didn't find anything burglaries continued uh the two that I mentioned and then\nAfter the are the most recent break in there was something of a shift in the effort that was being made by the detectives and they had some\nLeads on where to focus the search effort and then yesterday we were able to report about four o'clock in the afternoon that during one of those focused searches they spotted a guy walking through the brush he had a cooler and some camping type gear with him or as well as a gun\nAnd they arrested him they identified him as forty two year old Anthony rouda\nOr somebody who has to address histories and Florida Texas and here in Southern California specifically the San Fernando valley he was arrested without incident\nUh he was booked on either a parole or probation violation so he's being held with no bail\nAnd today the investigators on this case are examining the rifle that they found with him allegedly fight or to see if in fact that rifle can provide any link between this guy and some of these shootings namely the or the killing of trust into debt\nDid they find any other weapons but they say not that I'm aware of and he does have a criminal record apparently\nHe does it's a really minor bit off it's clear that virtual reality with yeah well he did go to prison for four years for a commercial burglary and he was also prosecuted for\nUm a being a felon in possession of a gun um and there's some interesting background there that we're trying to pull together\nBut are out of California he has a a prosecution in Texas for an assault and then a series of traffic issues in Florida which apparently is where he grew up he was wearing that kind of fatigue outfit do when they arrested him if he was wearing all black on black um I don't know the photos I saw of the arrest may have been taken after\nHe was partially searched or his clothing had been changed so it's not entirely clear what he was wearing when they stopped him but he was dressed in a way that's consistent with what was on the video from a week before\nThis about the trust into debt murder do was anything robbed from the tend towards Christian was there with his two children\nKnow and what's more is the investigators that we've been speaking with have told us that they're pretty convinced there was no contact between the killer and bow debt prior to the shooting\nAnd actually matches up more with some of these random vandalism pot shots type shootings that we've been hearing about in the Kenyan you'll remember that the sheriff's department said including the murder there were a total of eight shooting incidents that were being investigated\nA bow debts killing was the most serious but there was another hiker who was also shot or in the arm incidentally that hikers shooting is believed to have been done by somebody else right they don't think that has anything to do with this a burglar and possible suspect in the boat that shooting\nOr the boat debt shooting shot was fired from dozens of yards away from a zipped up tent in the darkness in other words there was no possibility in the detectives opinion recently that whoever pulled the trigger\nThat fired the bullet that killed ... even saw him\nCouldn't have seen him do that was inside a tent with his two daughters so it may even turn into a situation where it's impossible to file a murder charge because even though what was done was clearly criminal and a felony\nThere was no contact there was no ability for the person who fired the shots to have seen exactly what he or she was aiming at\nSo that's one of the big focus of the investigation right now as well\nThat was like you said the potshots theory now about about a a rouda himself yes a transient a survivalist I've heard I mean what would you characterize\n[noise] yeah his uh his family spoke to one of our other reporters today and I I think we're going to have some additional information\nAbout his background but yeah he's somebody that had a\nReputation for liking to be alone in the ... out in nature but would it that way so when family members heard that this individual had been detained\nThere wasn't a lot of surprise as to that part of the case and I think the investigators still aren't sure where this guy was living while he was out in the wilderness or they suspected that he was for a time hiding out in a cave somewhere in the in the state park land but they haven't found it\nAnd they've gone to great lengths to try to find it so it's not for lack of trying maybe he'll he'll tell them where he was\nAll right Eric thanks for that report we appreciate it OK taught you know Eric Leonard from NBC for with an update on yesterday's breaking news they ever arrested a suspect at least in the burglaries around Malibu Creek state park\nAre obviously he's a suspect in the murder of Christ into debt the Orange County man that was shot inside a tent back on June twenty second uh camping with his two young daughters in Malibu Creek state park a place I've never been and I don't think I'm going there if there's somebody out there taking potshots maybe this is the guy taking all the potshots maybe not\nWe'll find out when they test the weapon that they found them with\nMore coming up on the Johnny Ken she'll but right now is your chance to win a thousand dollars\n[noise] your shot at one thousand dollars now is the key word bank to

yet\nProbably because then I'll read it to you and this is what John Thomas in his team did now I noticed when we were looking at the first survey that came out I I Do deep into the paperwork and it looked like they were basically just ask him do you want to repeal the gas tax which is what shut down the ballot\nBut I'm afraid it's not and I guess they took a look at some of the other polling including public policy Institute that came out last week and said well we\nGot to re jigger the question so this is what people are being asked\nRepeal twenty Seventeen transportation laws to oh I'm Sorry for his part that's the is the title eliminate certain road repair and transportation funding require a certain fuel taxes in vehicle fees be approved by the electorate\nInitiative constitutional meant was that I ... and dry but focused on the first few words eliminate certain road repair and transportation funding but you\nKnow people are not following the gas tax as closely as a lot of your listeners are may look at that and go I I don't understand why would they want to cut road repair money\nAnd they voted no summary\nIs a little more specific\nRepairs uh twenty Seventeen transportation laws taxes and fees designated for road repairs in public transportation fiscal impact reduced ongoing revenues a five point one billion from state fuel vehicle taxes but mainly would have paid for a highway in road maintenance repairs as well as transit programs\nPeople maybe don't get that far I don't know I imagine this poll and not even allowed to read the uh the title maybe they read both I don't know but that is a major disappointment\nAlthough it is consistent with the other polling we've seen recently from other outfits that show that prop uh twenty eight prep Sixers in trouble with only twenty eight points or whatever was support so\nYou know we've got a Twenty one night we got to work harder than ever get the word out and I I Know I'm looking at the emails you people know you're in you're aware of the commercial load it's coming from the no on prop six people I told you they have tens of millions of dollars they were going to do this\nThis was a grassroots effort from the beginning and I did see a story a couple of weeks ago and I thought I care that much but there were some top level national\nAnd state wide Republicans who have been giving money to get prop six on the ballot but now they're not given any more money\nNot as qualified for the ... the strategy was well there's certainly get voters to come and maybe save our seats in the house of representatives or a legislature whatever they wanted to make sure prop six got on the ballot but they're not going to spend to spend the money on themselves right they might be in a close race\nThey have no money to spare for the rest of the ... campaign that's why you're going to go to the gas tax repeal dot org and do what you can and give what you can because a reform California I got to say this is up against it now with just under a month ago\nIt it's not looking good I mean we can still do this as I told you\nAccording to this poll there was a large chunk of people\nWho responded onshore because why not when\nYou were in almost thirty percent when you read them this summer and the title I don't think they even understand why this is on the ballot why would somebody just want to live in a road money\nAt least if they read a summary they might realize it's the gas tax repeal repeal to twenty Seventeen transportation but\nMaybe what they're doing the other side they hold all the statewide offices secretary of state attorney general\nSomebody and they went through this with a fine tooth comb All right well they got the gas tax surfing on the ballot wondering how can we messed with this one language can we right so that voters won't really understand including you don't understand twenty nine percent don't there on shore\nObviously is a big missing\nPiece for most of them so please gas tax repeal dot org do not forget that we will be an active auto body Ninety four east orange Thorpe avenue this isn't the Anaheim fortune area Wednesday October twenty four just

confronting them and actually lay in their hands on people that when we start\nSeeing from merging said they plan to sue for their losses model very\nWhat he had said yesterday I had two people run up to the vehicle these are shop owners that they wanted to be heard themselves they wanted to tell me how bad it's gotten so are they really did want to take the opportunity to share their side of the story one thing that they did seem to be some disagreement on\nIs whether the opening of the shelter actually increased the homeless population around there some people said they were sure it did others said maybe not but what I did hear over and again is that just by virtue of a shelter being there they say that their customers are\nScared of that or have the jitters about that and so just don't want to come and then the other element to it is remembered that this shelter went up on a parking lot\nAnd they say that's really the life blood particularly on the weekends that's the life blood because if you know this part of downtown LA just north of city hall and Alameda there's very little parking\nDon't get no say that because that parking lot is now being used for a shelter\nThat's really impacted or their businesses so uh yeah we heard the mayor said what he did and uh there may well be people who are are in support of it I just didn't find any today and you heard that that montage that people are saying that one in particular said he can absolutely show that forty percent\nOf drop since the shelter opened a couple of months ago so that that is what we heard this afternoon alright Andrew good reporting that you followed up with a politician\nStatement that business owners and the Pueblo historic district in downtown LA uh we've you know allied their fears we've got twenty four seven security\nOr ... they're happy with our homeless trailer camp but not really as Andrew just said everybody talked to not happy\n'cause you know what longtime customers know this is going up I don't think I'm coming to your restaurant through your little booth\nMuch anymore because I don't think it's a good idea to be hanging out here\nBecause they're putting this happens you just mentioned to quite parking and parking is always a big deal anybody who drives in LA meanwhile the city has decided\nThat around these Fifteen encampments that they're going to set up that want to put one in each city council district this was the one in the downtown LA council district they faced a lot of blowback\nIn Korea town is you know they have to come up with a new plan they are ill and also the same things going on in San Pedro which we'll talk about in a few minutes and up in Sherman Oaks haven't really gotten off the ground and the other ones yet but what what they want to do in downtown and that's where they are starting is that they want to crack down on the regular homeless encampments\nAre they're they're not really want to win for some of the rules because they're they don't want and that's what Andrew was trying to find out and he got a mixed response whether\nOr not this official city homeless encampments is attracting more homeless people\nTo the area they're like oh are they going to travel bathrooms they got probably got food I think I'll go down there into pitch a tent on the sidewalk nearby so I can take advantage of some of

here on getting by John is on vacation I'm here with the number more meaning the execution death whereas today we were waiting to see whether or not Tennessee\nState we [noise]\nI don't think I've ever talked about at the execution desk\nWas going to execute a man who when we covered this story a couple of days ago he apparently wanted to die in the electric chair\nNow he was scheduled to die by lethal injection he committed a couple of murders back in the Nineteen eighties\nHe of course filed all the appeal paperwork not to be executed it all his name was Edmund George the Gore ski sixty three years old he killed two men and it was one of these drug deal gone wrong to thirty five year old men were killed in a drug deal in Nineteen eighty three\nAnd lethal injection as the primary form of execution in Tennessee but\nIf you're a fence happened before January Nineteen Ninety nine you can pick the electric chair\nAnd apparently and I think part of this was just another one of his maneuvers to put this offer as long as possible he was saying well you know what a I don't like lethal injection I think that's a horrible way to die\nYou I might have resulted in delays because we don't know the story with tendencies electric chair and what they'd have to do\nTo meet his request meanwhile he uh by the way though the state told his legal team he needed to uh have made the electric chair option by the close of business on September twenty seven\nOh they didn't file the paperwork for the share until Monday so because they missed the deadline he was denied the electric chair so\nWe'd hoped maybe he would get the lethal injection but he's not going to because the sixth circuit of the U.S court of appeals gave him a stay of execution\nAnd um their grounds and it was not because everybody's been doing this now for a couple of years labor fight and lethal injection on the ground and it's a cruel and then your main way to die based on the sporadic reports\nFrom a couple of states will turn out pretty old whether we just go to Texas ... apparently goes very quickly and very quietly I but difficulty obtaining these drugs\nBecause the manufacturers have gotten involved in this they do not want their drugs to be used for\nFor ... executions so it's complicated things for states to get a hold of the right drugs and instead they there's a cocktail that they would use in Tennessee and it was like I think it was three or four drugs\nAnd he does all of them are very ... bromide potassium chloride yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah of course they were fighting on the grounds that uh that's a terrible way to kill somebody but actually what they did also for the grounds for appeal was they were claiming that there was inadequate council\nAnd this is another old trick that people use and appeals and I didn't get the right lawyer I didn't get the right advice I was denied my rights to adequate competent counsel and what the sixth circuit said well\nWe're going to get to hear your full story so we're going to it's not that he's not going to be executed eventually but they gave him his stay so for now\nIs the ... will not be executed they line was at a minimum are due process requires he'd be afforded an opportunity to present his appeal to us\nSo it was like a quick emergency decision to give us Stay till they hear his whole claim of having an adequate ah incompetent or whatever legal counsel so ah he was and if they do\nMove forward with the execution he is not going to get the electric chair looks like he's going to have to take the lethal injection so now the other big execution death story\nThat happened today comes out of the state of Washington where the state's Supreme Court\nApparently has deemed the death penalty arbitrary and racially biased\nAnd they've abolished capital punishment in the state of Washington and this was not a state where anybody is executed very often anyway and in fact they're already was a moratorium on executions so the the governor there Jay Inslee and already put a moratorium on executions and looks like it was a four year moratorium\nBut now the state Supreme Court there has made it permanent the court said that eight people on death row eight people\nI Know it's a much more of a state in California we have like seven hundred or so we have an execution anybody I don't think they have either a long time the court said that eight people on death row now must have their sentences converted to life in prison", "year": "2018", "show_name": "John and Ken", "city": "Los Angeles",
