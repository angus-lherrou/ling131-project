Sunday but they released a clip\nAnd Trump is calling for an end to birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants in the U.S and he claims he can do it through executive order that

for hate groups to spread\nWhite supremacy in this country is a new you know their belief system is a new but there's a couple of trends that are converging that are making this a particularly violent crime in our history\nEleven people were killed last Saturday and what's believed to be the largest anti Semitic hate crime in us history President Trump and the first lady had\nVisited Pittsburgh to

the mere temporary or partial jurisdictions such as uh applied by temporary ... what we were told visitors today who are just here and still owe allegiance to their home country\nSo why there's so many legal scholars see it otherwise I mean I'm I've just read a story three minutes ago headlines says Trump is dead wrong\nWell partly because they've not looked at the original material they just look at the\nThe language subject to the jurisdiction in our modern five different like well that means you're subject to the law then yes it means at least that uh but they don't they don't take any deeper in that in fact I've been debating folk all day who who get quote the fourteenth amendment and just say all persons born here are citizens and they completely leave out\nThe additional clogged with add additional requirement\nRight in that cause you say has backed up by public statements at the time\nPublic statement at the time executive ... executive or opinions or the attorney general at the time Supreme Court decisions at the time absolutely\nNow the Supreme Court has never ruled specifically on this issue right\nOh that's right what they did rule and Eighteen Ninety eight\nOr that the child of Chinese immigrants uh was a citizen because he was born on us soil but they go out of their way to point out that the parents were lawful permanent\nLawfully and permanently Thomas filed here that was a legal term of art that means they were permanently here is what we today would call a lawful permanent resident somebody with a green card\nThey weren't just a temporary visitor and they certainly weren't here illegally\nBut the courts have ruled on issues surrounding this over the years concerning illegal immigrants and their rights and the children of illegal immigrants and their rights\nNever never no no Supreme Court cases ever held that the children of illegal immigrants are automatically get a footnote in Nineteen eighty two and a case where the Supreme Court erroneous lamb I've you\nKnow how that the children of illegal immigrants got free public education and I was thinking of Texas right yeah\nTexas cases pilot versus do and they drop it footnote said this is an out of the ordinary their armed radically citizens if they're born here for the fact that they were born someplace else does I mean they don't get free education well it was a footnote it was not an issue in that case nobody argued about it they just drop is little footnote in it and it is patently not true it's it's what we called\nA that doesn't have any bearing it's not a holding of the court\nCan you hang on for a second question which is the big one concerning Trump sure was one of the new Trump could do this by executive order we're talking to Dr John Eastman constitutional

was the depth of Whitey Bolger\nAnd the reason that this a gangster is relevant to California's because that's where they found him in Santa Monica in twenty eleven if you remember that story from seven years ago this is a Boston gangster\nWho apparently a well carried out you know his wishes just like the old time gangsters did he kill people it was eventually convicted of ... murders but he was a top gangster in Boston for decades eventually it says he became an FBI informant\nHe also disappeared for sixteen years\nHe disappeared until they finally caught up with them in Santa Monica in twenty eleven brought him back to Boston for a trial it was convicted and obviously was sentenced to what would be life because he was already in his eighties\nHe died today at the age of eighty nine not long after he was transferred to a new facility in West Virginia very unpleasant death\nSources tell the daily mail dot com that Bolger was about to dish on an FBI\nInformant program so the word is he was murdered by a couple of fellow federal inmates who supposedly pummeled him with a walk in a sock and tried to gouge his eyes out with a shift\nHe was in a wheelchair 'cause he's in poor health and apparently they somehow whether he was in his cell or not they they wheeled him away from security cameras so he was kind of out of sight and then beat him to death\nSo he couldn't fight back since he's\nStuck in the wheelchair that says made in general population and they just welder way out of what the lock 'em sock\nYes and then they go to sort of a shift to try to get out his eyes out that that that's a sign that it it was a hit these must have been a mobster guys well that's what they're aiming to bring the gang mobster guys like to I like to send a message to anybody else who thinks they're going to a rat out\nTo the FBI it's like here's what's gonna happen to you yeah it's because they you know I think it's one thing to get whacked to get shot in the head it's another thing\nTo get your eyes gouged out while you're still alive\nHe got two life sentences now at a trial he denied it was an FBI informant but they think he was been one since as far back as Nineteen Seventy five which allegedly allowed him to commit any crime he wanted to except for murder\nYeah no that's the only and so he got away with a lot of stuff I don't think it's possible for a guy like him to live for sixteen years out of here in Santa Monica out in the open how come he was so how come he was so I'm unafraid of walking publicly in the streets down the prominent going out to dinner with his girlfriend when\nHe was like one of the most notorious gangsters in American history I mean outside of the Italian Mafia this guy was number one\nYeah and one in Boston for dead he killed lots of people how can you walk free unless he had some kind of protection the rumors\nWere he was going to try to out people who were in the top tier of the FBI informant program that was going to be his new information\nOr says he hadn't even been process that this prison in West Virginia when he was killed he was going to out who though\nUh it says the top echelon so these would be FBI people who run the FBI informant program I guess he was gonna say there must be something corrupt about it you think the FBI ... well they're doing or they got ...\nHe was he outing um inmates to do it for the which he out of the people to the FBI or outing people who were informants so that the the mobsters will know who who turned coats are\nI Know I obviously the informative programs so that he can work on the inside and give them the names of guys they can prosecute for gang crimes\nIt was south Boston's winter hill gang is called you know there's not there's not a whole lot of detail here no but it is here someone knew he was being transferred and put the word out because they killed them right after he got there\nAh\nAccording to the story in the uh the daily mail a soldier's brother John said that the family is not actually been notified of his death yet but they are investigating a fellow inmate with mafia connections\nHe says he was familiar with prisons because he went with his father to his job as superintendent of transportation in the Massachusetts state prison back in the forties and fifties he says he was about four\nAges four and a sixteen when he would tag along with the dad are and that as a teenager he helped his father move the state's old electric chair when the prison relocated\nThis guy is sick because in addition to the electric chairs that he was building\nHe would build refurbish a or consult on\nGas chambers lethal injection machines and the gallows where people get hang\nFor at least twenty seven states he was like the execution doctor in all of this um however after his comments about how the Holocaust and the fact like you said he didn't have an engine engineering degree or a license he uh got booted out of all of the work that he had been doing\nI've got a Megan Kelly update ooh you want to hear it or to do\nSo Megan Kelly you know as out at NBC she was making twenty three million dollars a year but this three year deal for a one hour show\nAnd ah\nShe went on the air and she said that blackface wasn't a big deal back when she was a kid\nAnd everybody at NBC lost their mind it didn't help that she has bad ratings and she is not a friendly to work with\nA lot of people at NBC never really took to her member she came in as Matt Lauer was leaving Matt Lauer who was loved by a lot of those people and feels like he kind of fell on his sword a little bit there even though he did have that creepy button in his room that lock the door um but then everybody did they said\nRight ... so she's out but there's a lot of\nMoney on the table like a thirty eight million dollars she told NBC that she will not make a tell all book will not spill the beans that she has on NBC\nFor another ten million dollars [laughter] an additional ten million that's a good deal sources familiar with the negotiations say that NBC offered Kelly thirty eight million which was the balance owed on her contract\nAnd\nThey would be thirty eight million dollars plus you have to sign this confidentiality agreement so she would not be able to go\nRight that tell all book about NBC and the secret buttons and the offices and her lawyer came back and said All right Megan will sign a confidentiality agreement for another ten million so that would bring the total the forty\nEight million NBC told the attorney and get the hell out of here [laughter]\nWhen she left box she did write a book about it settled for more is what the book was called\nWhich is exactly what she's trying to do now yeah\nAnd she has been critical of the network censor exit who knows if she's trying to get to another ten million or if it's her lawyers\nBut you know there's a book opportunity here yeah absolutely um she has been\nA she has been quite vocal today as well\nOn Twitter if you want to call it vocal about the way she's been treated lately she says for a week paparazzi has been lurking outside my home day and night finally today took my kids to school I went out a loan first offered them doughnuts and beg them to just take their pick on me\nAnd my kids alone when they emerged over a very nice except she calls out the daily mail\nThe daily mail first publish photos of my husband in our home and then did photograph my kids trailed us to my daughter's school and secretly videotape my seven year old child and her classmates and then posted it and then she wrote in all caps this is not right\nI don't understand me I I I like following the story because I'm curious to see how NBC is going to handle this but why would I why would I care what her daughter looks like yeah why would I care what her husband looks like or if he's doing at home or we that intrusive that we have to know everything about these people\nYes that's I mean we're not but the paparazzi is insane and they go after this CD and eat less stories and and get whatever the hell they can\nBut does that sell papers or does that produce clicks hey we have a shot at making Kelly's husband got a shutter Yardley cooking baking\nYeah our kids' names are ... Yardley and Thatcher\nA downside to bomb never understood if that was an attempt to make them sound smarter or just the clever naming thing\nI don't get it I don't know I don't know\nI well you said today that was the first time in a long time you've ever wanted to have kids\nOh boy that come on in in\n... already and so we're not going to be done answering about ALS by the time I get home to Montana and\nOkay so they're just pushing ... and they'll get it [laughter]\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise] right [noise] [laughter] you're going to say trick or treat\nThank God I Would say goes and I'm\nSuzie homemaker Lovett have candy enjoy yourself a John what's coming up on the show\nA lawyer was we just thought that was Ken dressed as John uh you know I didn't always a cat and a ghost no [laughter] do you think Ken would work I still know what was the last time you think Ken work ...

Harris these are people that won statewide office ... Democrats do not want to pay the gas tax they don't ... the big majorities of people want the gas tax repeal\nBut I'm afraid we're literally it's blended in in other words\nYou don't want to do their resigned to high gas prices and they're not sitting there picking out the gas tax necessarily as one of the things that they have about I think they want to repeal the gas tax those polls showed overwhelmingly right what what these other ... like you're up to make and they don't it's an optimism is the way I look at people\nMost people want to repeal the gas tax will then ... and I don't believe in certainty talked about certainty\nWell you're very confident that six ... yeah but that's not certain see I I think when you look at enough polls they're pretty accurate I said that before we did that in twenty sixteen as well you know you can't just look at the time Paul and decide no but if you look at everybody's polls actually turned out pretty close\nBy Trump lost the popular vote but he won the states\nAnd it was only the difference of a few votes in a few states that made the margin in that election so yeah but there was a lot wrong the New York times had Hillary winning with a Ninety nine percent chance\nThat was early early in the day right by the hour anybody really holiday [laughter] still [laughter]\nI Do it without the lectures only came down to a few states in only came down to a few thousand votes so that could have gone either way they nobody did the rational thing which is due in electoral college kept the popular vote does it matter and everyone was clinging to popular vote polling that doesn't matter\nOh yeah no right well they did a state by state polling but they were wrong\nThey were wrong and some of the key states that they thought Hillary was going to win Wisconsin but then again you know Trump to win win by much I mean you're talking about the value of ever wrong is wrong wrong is wrong and if if there is a question that can determine what a person knows about prop six walking in and I haven't seen that question and there is no question\nI just think a lot of people are gonna be hunting to repeal the gas tax\nI yeah I Hope so I I have a feeling well\nI'm hoping that the people that are uninformed a low information voters don't vote they ignore the whole thing see I think they're informed but giving them that that summary poll question\nI think it seems like a completely different but by now everybody's got their ballot guide in the mail if they're looking for the gas tax repeal they dumped through it and say well where the hell is it an added on many people read\nThe guy never I never even see mine otherwise you're going to walk in there and be like a take twenty I take a voter guide and I can't remember all the propositions\nYeah so I I think I think every you know everybody listening you bring in the voter guide follow what we do\nIt'll have a huge impact especially on projects like we've got no judges in their trust the voter that's like half my voter I just looked at it yesterday like oh the ... oh my gosh well judges yet well whatever judges make it through on the air as are the ones I vote for\nGoing to vote knows all one just because the California Supreme Court judges I don't like what's going on at stake [laughter] well you don't vote on them do they it's yeah you do I thought they were appointed by the governor know\nThere was no\nThey don't but they have candidates running against them now I think the Supreme Court is a is a point I think you have do you will yes but there's something that came up because there's a royal yes there's something like that 'cause I thought they also do times\nI'm In a ah ah but\nI Can't find you know\nGive it a law will take a few minutes yeah oh you're in his judicial Supreme Court justice vote yes or no for each office\nAnd they've got two of them here\nFor associate justice of the Supreme Court county Oregon yes and for associate justice is a ...

them and one of those issues is illegal immigration what's funny is they\nPlayed a lot of clips over the last year as a as Trump and and the and the wall that whole issue heat it up and in the past

C. two of these exact same model buses caught fire and twenty twelve and the entire fleet was permanently removed from service it was the first time Gallagher and heard about it in Washington DC they deemed\nThe buses to be unsafe after two fires and pulled them off the road and you're not aware of that no I'm Sorry I'm not this is on the yard of empty\nWe showed the video of the burnt out buses to LA county supervisor Janice Hahn horrible most of the roots are in her district and she sits on the MTA bored\nI'm going to ask for a full investigation of these ... says I'm going to ask why having these buses and replace when are they supposed to be replaced for hadn't been for you I wouldn't have known about anything 'cause\nNow empty claims these are the last of the old buses that are left in their fleet they say new ones will start to come in and a couple of months and they hope that all fifty two would be replaced by next summer\nThere well then I wouldn't take a bus until they're right because they might explode you're going to die in a fire and so we did the bus story was ... electric buses or couldn't go up hills and we're breaking down\nLike the other ones are catching fire the yeah yeah the the the old gas powered bus or what a disaster this empty a is isn't it and then they wait why ridership is down by the way\nThat the the the the guy they talked to\nWho didn't know that and watch it is one in the ... classic your credit black kid dead eyes they look at the video tasty do we face oh oh I didn't know that do why didn't know that [laughter]\nI'd got coming up we'll talk about the birthright citizenship debate will also tell you about the latest with the Caribbean and the deployment of troops to the border coming Johnny ...
