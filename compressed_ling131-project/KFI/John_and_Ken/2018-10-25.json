censoring [noise]\nJohnny Cash and coming up they're gonna have updates on what's going on with all the explosive packages packages really designed them look like bombs\nInvestigators say some of the package bombs targeting a prominent Democrat and\nA democratic supporters were sent through the U.S postal service but that no new ones have been found in the mail system in the last eight hours postal employees and inspectors are searching male facilities for packages matching those ten Center for the last four days they are treating the devices as if\nThey are real and harmful however there is no evidence to suggest that that they are letting us know about that's far\nUm we're in the middle of doing some uh some cool science stories we talked about ... and a baby occupy\nAnd things like the uh turns out that alcohol is good for you well let's\nGo with this will go and this is this study coming from Brown University that is a good one [laughter] you know this is a [laughter] there's nothing coming from\nThe su Chico\nJoe's tavern this is Brown University one glass of wine could be enough for you to dismiss your bad memories and focused only on the good ones how nice is that alcohol hijacked the pathway that forms memory on a very\nBasic fundamental molecular level\nI Wonder if that was also in the molecular ecology journal that we have yet to get\nTo their possibly does but alcohol affects the gene that's involved within coating whether a memory is pleasing or on pleasing unpleasant and then changes a protein that gene makes which in turn makes you form craving memories\nAnd what's interesting is they say that these uh one drink will change the pathway for just an hour but you stack on three of those drinks and it will change that pathway for twenty four\nHours so you have good memories for twenty four hours well\nAt the very least you remember the good things that happen to you and those twenty four hours and don't run an hour the rug burn the stumbling the bad things that you said the mumbled word\nJust spice dance strip routine I remember oil and Philadelphia I remember all of that arming the stage on Justin standup\nNight after two Manhattan's anti margarita I've apologized for that the team that's of me says it's [laughter] been teams\nAs its findings may help explain why recovering alcoholic find it hard to stay on the wagon is used you quit the alcohol and you're like why some yeah I Know I remember all the bad things that this could lead to forms of treatment that help decrease how long the craving memories last or how intense they are\nIt's interesting so one of the authors and assistant professor of neuroscience says she's been interested in studying why uh drugs that we abuse like alcohol or opiates\nProduce rewarding memories despite the fact that they are neuro talks to I mean they're bad for you they produce side effects hangovers nausea but we consider them rewarding because they cause these cravings and these positive memories that is screwed up\nFor this study they use fruit flies because fruit flies are middle or attracted to alcohol\nBecause fruit flies in humans ... you know see that's the ... ah\nIt's just a but it's a very strange thing addiction experts warn that obviously alcohol can make you forget and even ease symptoms like stress and worry and negative thoughts I mean the ah the old\nAdage of you have a really rough day just go you know pop down a glass of wine and your stress starts to melt away but it's only for a short time before it actually wears off\nSo the other thing is binge drinking there was another article also about binge drinking and is this kind of depressing a little bit this one is different because this University of Illinois at Chicago and it suggests that if you're unable to stop at one drink it may be genetic\nScience is already know that that alcohol can cause neurons in a region called the venture all tax mental area to release doping me but now they're saying the exact pathway alcohol use is to cause a reaction has been uncovered\nAnd it may be a genetic thing\nThey're talking about people who may have an increased pre disposition to binge drink specifically so in that case they actually use my money and then make the lab for getting\nMy alley or hitting my drunk you're getting fruit flies drunk [noise] can I let me go through this ... this is Laurie I'm Luke demonic if you drink too much alcohol he had just ... ... ... talk about that one ah that one column about how many drinks I'd I'd a sitting\nYes well it's a scoring system and I'm not going to give it to get into too many details but these are the questions that they would ask you\nTo determine your risk of alcohol abuse how often do you have a drink containing alcoholic never maybe once a month two to four times a month two to three times a week or four plus times per week and then you get a score for each one of those answers\nHow many units of alcohol do you drink on a typical day when you are drinking from zero to three or four five or six seven to nine or ten\nPlus how do you drink ten plus that's a problem\nAnd then of course um have you ever read out not to be the ... alcohol problems or how often during the last\nYear if you had a feeling of guilt or remorse after drinking as somebody ever been injured\nAs a result of your drinking and has anybody ever said to you that they're concerned about your drinking and suggest and and you might want to cut back on that but so anyway you get a score for that and then they determine whether or not you have the potential\nTo be at a problem level for alcohol in check you want to give some good news before we go what's that I don't know\nUnless it on a downer now tomorrow we're going to take a we're going to take calls from people who've been cremated and see where they're sitting\nThat's good well I mean because we were talking about take calls oh let's take calls from people who have a

Martin live from the campaign twenty four hour news round officials say it's likely there could be more package bombs like the one Santa high profile Democrats many of whom have criticized President Trump and YPG commissioner James O'Neill says ten crudely made pipe bombs have been intercepted\nThat can say with certainty that we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts the latest three package\nBombs were sent to actor Robert De Niro and former vice president Biden officials say the white powder in the envelope send to CNN's office in New York with tested and it's harmless the Trump Administration says it plans to send more troops to the U.S Mexico border\nIt's a headline service combined with whatever's incendiary enough to get hits right and these days it's Seventeen anti Trump stories because I guess most of the people who read the LA Times news or left wing progressive and they need their little shot of adrenaline day Trump\nBut others your normal news stuff for regular people you you can't find it they'll say they cover it and it's there but it\nIs not visible but most people would probably like me the only look at the front page so right you're going to jump out of people or you're not gonna have any plans for them to click the story and then you get a little more\nViews and it's actually quite a story out front page but I think I think what what a cause I I I've actually tracked different news websites and there are certain stories that stick and\nThey'll keep 'em at the top all day oh yeah right sometimes several days or sometimes they go away and they come back yeah I'm a ... if you track or the New York post for example the the Los Angeles times a lot a lot of newspapers do that so they only play the hits on the front page\nWhat's going to get them a more clicks right and stuff that's\nAlso important but doesn't yeah I I think if you put a gas tax story on the front page of the LA Times right a lot of people would read it but if if there aren't enough people right away to read it evaporates and plus you can't trust Los Angeles times to cover it honestly anyway so it's probably ... is probably better stories bird\nBecause they're so dishonest well well it just shows you still got a lot of work to do gas tax repeal dot org\nSocial social media is the secret weapon here\nIs yeah since you were saying yesterday actually it is well you don't have a you know what I made choices you can't control the television stations and they're not covering it you can't control the ... times for reasons we just explain what can you control\nOr you don't you know you you can't buy TV and radio commercials or on your own but you do have people on on your ah I guarantee most cases the people on your Facebook feed her or any of the other services don't wanna I don't want to pay for the gas tax some talent\nAnd encourage them to spread the word to their set of friends do\nYou know I mean this stuff and go viral to do it and yet that's the sexy but yeah it could go viral that's it costs nothing and it's not something anybody is going to track ... not going to show up at a poll or anything but it can be can be extremely effective now but you have to do it\nSo doing public policy shows that John Cox among likely voters has done eleven forty nine to thirty eight which is actually a bit better than it was the last time yeah hold people yeah but that's\nWell he's got to get all the independence that's all he's not there there's there's no there's no he's running with the independence but it's only forty three thirty eight liberal where's the front\nBurner campaign where is the aggressive campaign that makes every one set up and and and pay attention\nA lot of the saying about I was yeah a lot of us in radio now it's just they're both advertising heavily\nI don't know about appearance ... advertising heavily because I think the media got bored with covering their appearances\nSo now it's really well yeah you know I see the ads I wouldn't say there's a lot of them is the kind of money that new some as but yeah I think ... million I think he was being outspent by huge multiple right right so stay with prop six\nThat's the tough part about this one funny thing in the Senate race not that we care we have Feinstein on the voter guide she's leading daily own forty three to twenty seven foot almost twenty five percent\nLikely voters say they're not going to vote in the race we're going to pass that's how disgusted they are all those those are Republicans who ah\nThey don't have a candidate ... why should why should I not going to vote for either one either yeah no doubt that race I'm skipping right this is the problem I mean you talked to we got stuck with to tour Democrats I mean she she's a horrible person which she did Brett Kavanaugh that was disgusting and filthy\nOr that that is unforgivable and daily on it's just a lunatic I mean he belongs in a padded room in a mental asylum\nWell with a with a with a needle in his arm he's running on simple anti oh Trump and open border agenda that's his whole campaign expert left wing children\nWell you know why they're not buying it or they know normal personal normal person with a job is buying it that's for the uh you know the left wing or the well flakes in San Francisco why who can no thank God I mean he's still got twenty seven percent but I thought if a guy like that gets elected that shows you how loyally way out there in the Senate has gone\nIt's it's it's not no it's not that far gone\nIt you know it you know I guess not you need an effective candidates or with an effective campaign and and you and you can you can do a lot of damage but we just we just don't have that you know you can't you can't you can't go to a a knife fight with a feather and expect to when you're not going to you need you need to you need a God is what you need\nYou know we're at least out a much bigger knife\nIt's actually you're right half of Republicans but twenty two percent of the decline to state said they're not going to vote in the race so they're going to vote ... they're they're both they're both bowel movement\nWho cares\nDemocrats are going to be in the minority anyway so you're you're you're voting for a for an old or an old poop or or a a a mental a show in it and they're not going to have any power anyway so what does it matter in the Senate they're going to be you know you could you get two dead people running against each\nOther does make a difference maybe we've got one dead person in the race or you're particularly bitter today\nI Am I'm I'm I'm In I'm In a foul mood I told you I was I got in the office and I saw you I Want to don't me\nYeah soon as I say I didn't have that huh and I said I Want to go home I heard that you didn't say as soon as I said oh I get it yeah\nI was connected like well I saw you and I wanted to go [laughter] well that's that's what you're saying as well yeah in a moment I saw you because you were there [laughter] no actually it was you know [laughter] I drove you out of your ah your ear today I think I'd want to say but I Want to go\nBy when we come back we'll give you the latest in the search for the a pipe bomb mailer and of course uh today's\nNews it Robert De Niro and Joe Biden or the latest targets of these uh these guys they're calling them crude devices that are being sent to crewmen of ISIS and crude device the media term it is a good media like normal people don't say crude devices they call it a bomb\nYeah but it's not the owner said doesn't even qualify as a bomb well that was something has to go off to be a bomb ... and not only do it may have just been a threat to like some guy put together some weird looking thing that resembles a bomb and like yeah oh ... away and we'll get into all this coming up on the John and catch a wake up you're paying attention\nNow [laughter]\nWhat

with them because then the guy that kind of like having your show wimax itself on standby [noise] shouting can\nShow John ... forty nine so the news this morning is that more bombs\nSuspicious packages were sent [noise] Joe by\nJoe Biden's apparently some mail sorting center in Delaware\nIt was one of those address the Joe Biden\nRobert Deniro the actor Rebecca productions in New York City and apparently a staffer there took a look at some delivery and thought it looked kind of a similar 'cause the guy puts it it looks like it 'cause I look at the picture again\nHe puts it in like one of those manila envelopes there's not actually a package package I get a box right so what he's got all these little stamps all over all the CNN\nPicture is the one that's been making the rounds the one that went to a device that was sent the CNN and then it's got like a it's not a handwritten or talking typed out the return address was his Debbie Wasserman Schultz uh-huh\nThey Democrat it was the former head of the DNC and it's a return address in Florida and then he's got like a mailing label but it's a do you you actually just use a bunch of stamps one two three four five six stamps I guess and\nExcept that CNN packages Caribbean by a courier yes so the stamps were a\nA prop a prop ...\nNo well what does the courier no\nI imagine they're being interviewed they didn't describe the career I mean I I saw today in the post is it a problem with using the couriers you actually have to drop it off with a courier company and they have cameras in there that's what happened I remember that guy in Texas a couple of years ago they I think is what the fed ex and he dropped off one of these explosive packages and now that I'm On video and then they tracked him down\nI didn't know this until today but\nIf you want to send a letter or package right and you don't want anyone to know where it came from\n... ah they know photograph\nWhere the male originates yeah while they might not have your address if you go to the Burbank post office they'll know case it's there's something bad in the package they'll know eventually that this came from the Burbank post office which of course greatly reduces the the investigation area\nIt claims it's a sophisticated imaging system that photograph the outside of each piece of mail processed around the country and can be used to determine the specific location of where it was sent that's how they found a woman who sent the rice and through the mail to Obama yeah and Michael Bloomberg and twenty Thirteen I remember that story so most people don't know that\nSo you can't just send a package anonymously or put a fake return address they know exactly what post office that came out of that with the DNA evidence obviously there's fingerprints\nSaliva her live in a sweat skin cells and cells you could have anything it's like off your body yeah there'll be competed for all that stuff and because packages didn't explode that's a good thing that can really take this thing apart they can dissemble the device examine the components\nAnd they think is a good chance whoever has done this might already be in the\nDatabase because they've made threats ... right right they're already crazy right off the if the if the guy's forty years old he just didn't wake up uh last week and decided to send bombs in the mail right the Democrats you know he's been he's been crazy all his life and they do track\nWhat people said publicly and write on social media publicly there there's already list so if you if you get on Facebook and you write something a violent about Joe Biden that's in the database\nSomewhere they've already collected that so you're on the list\nNow and then they'll look and see where the packages from and if it is let's say it's a guy from Burbank it's like oh you nailed it from the Burbank post office and look ah Joe schmuck ah went off the rails about a bite and a few months ago well let's go knock

I hate them or I ... well then you go to your pet or whatever you're so you don't want to put a plastic\nBag over my head that's what I Do so now to commercials in a row because what they've done is they deem ... diem masculine eyes the mascot alone all men on TV commercials is that right now I Am or do they have been neutered and feminine rushed oh and last night back to back\nDuring the world series were two guys and of course they both had soft appears that's another thing I must have seen eleven commercials in a row where the main guy had a beard I don't know what this is but there are no clean shaven men\n'cause I thought beards were assigned a masculinity but they make them really really soft insensitive beards and they both in\nBoth commercials the women were clearly working and the men were stay at home dads and they were wearing a baby sacks around their neck they were carrying around but do you\nCall those things ah maybe carriers I Know they need to learn\nTo be on this you know she wrote a really annoying name too right yeah so they both have these things where they're carrying the babies in the sack in front of their chest they both have the beard they're not even

hundred thousand [noise] um they would have to\nPay market rate on that are remaining too that difference of the two hundred thousand because that's fair\nOkay so they're just paying the increase on two hundred thousand rather than the whole eight hundred thousand\nThat it's the absolutely correct\nThe ... who is there anybody against this idea this this seems to make sense on the surface\n[noise] yes there there are some that fear is that um this is going to cost\nUs some counties a lost revenue\nUh unfortunately they analysis doesn't look at a couple of things that are very very important from real world analysis which the California voters are not getting through the legislative analysts office and that is it doesn't take into account all of the economic activity that happens around home sales\nPeople buy a home and they remodel a re rough they put new appliances than um\nThey buy a new car because the old car doesn't look good and then your neighborhood I mean all those things um generate a sales tax and income tax and they're not looking at that when they make an analysis and they also don't take into account the fact that the home that they sell at a lower\nTax basis comes to market at the new at the new you know if the parents taxed on the new price right\nThe new younger families who by these big homes will be paying full a property tax rates\nFor pop\nIn a legislative analysts office in Sacramento they did an analysis things you're talking about they think it'll be tens of thousands more older homeowners buying homes under prop five which could boost sales by eight percent statewide new home sales are home sales yes\nYes and that's what you guys are looking for but you think that's going to really make a dent in the housing crisis that we face in all the people that are priced out or [noise]\nYou know there are several factors leading to the housing crisis in California let's just start with availability lack of availability drives lack of affordability it's supply and demand right\nUm this would this would mean an additional tens of thousands of home sales per year\nBarclay from those folks that are frozen in their homes now because it's unaffordable for them to move on fixed incomes and pay higher property taxes this would free up tens of thousands of homes for those families in California all over the state that um are looking for a home and it's just simply can't find\nYou know I just I think the best thing is it gives freedom to people to move when they want to move without being unfairly penalized by the idiots in government I don't think people should be trapped living\nIn a house they don't want to be in a new property or Thirty years because the government is abusive but their property and so if it's a problem at all it should be removed as an impediment\nAlright well very good Steve White thanks for coming on my pleasure\nPresidents of the California association of
