Harris was the one pressing of course yes\nHarsh supplemental update to the previous background investigation was limited in scope and that that is consistent with the standard process for such investigations going back quite a long ways\nDid the FBI look into allegations as to whether judge Kavanaugh lied to Congress during his testimony\nThat's not something I can discuss here\nThat was an interesting thing 'cause\nI mean he didn't obviously didn't answer the question because he couldn't but I Wonder if in fact that was part of the the questioning remember there were allegations that he was perjuring himself when he said he wasn't blackout was never a blackout drunk yeah or didn't there was never a time when he didn't remember\nI think that's how am I think that's in answering that yes that they did talk about it that they did at least look into that yeah um he would not\nAnswer or could not answer is the way the Washington Post writes it up could not answer whether or not Don McGahn the White House counsel was playing a role in the discussions between the White House and the FBI\nSaying only that he was told the FBI's security division coordinated the effort into this background investigation with the White House office of security but that to reiterate what he said there are a few seconds ago he was consistent with the standard process for such a these investigations going back quite a long way\nHere's the thing and and I felt this way back back then when it happened what was that last week we have for all of it seems like that was so long ago but it's not an FBI investigation it's a background check the White House is looking to put somebody in a particular job\nSo they direct the FBI to look into this person's background just like they would look into your background or my background they're not going to look back in to high school ... and what you did or didn't do at at a party where you had too many beers it's just not part of\nA background check on it when people started calling an investigation that's when it started making everybody who wanted Kavanaugh to crash and burn they may lose their minds because how could the FBI not investigate ah Christine Ford in ... an interview them and all of this\nOh that's not\nWhat the background check was called for by the employer which was the Trump Administration right\nThis is not this is not a criminal probe is not a criminal investigation those are done independently because the FBI is trying to help an attorney figure out a prosecutor figure out if someone should be charged with a crime\nIn a background investigation probe whatever you want to call it they're doing an investigation that's at the direction of and specification of in this case the employer the White House to answer a particular question about a nominee or or a job\nCandidate it's even different than\nA security clearance investigation for example because one of the things they would look for in a security clearance investigation is there anything in that person's past which would make them susceptible to some sort of black\nMales do you ... I mean you would ask questions of\nBrett Kavanaugh as family and friends coworkers et cetera people does he uh was he ever known for having an affair did he ever a contract a sexually transmitted disease at any point is there any embarrassing things that he would not want publicized\nDoes he have a drinking problem has he ever used drugs those sites those types of things\nBecause those could potentially be held against someone\nI'm In an effort to flip them if some outside for an agency wanted to get a a Supreme Court justice to flip you just hold all of this stuff over their heads\nAnd potentially make them a security risk again that's not to say that this was done or wasn't done in the background investigation but it's different than a top you know classified level security clearance that being said when he worked in the White House that's exactly what happened\nWhen he was working in the White House counsel's office under Bush those are the types of questions that were asked they weren't necessarily asked in this case but they had been aspect and some of those questions were asked and answered already\nOne thing I didn't understand about all of this and Christopher Wray didn't answer this question necessarily was\nWhy were judge Kavanaugh and Dr Ford not interviewed themselves by agents well now said not to I Know well why wouldn't they want that to happen just well when we talk here in ... of\nRight well I think the FBI did I think a number of agents wanted to just for the appearance of them doing a thorough pro ... or whatever background check one of my favorite things\nTo come out of the Kavanaugh circus was what happened on Twitter um there are people in the world named Brett Kavanaugh there are people named Christine forward a Brett Kavanaugh from Kentucky tweeting last week this is a terrible time to be named Brett Kavanaugh [laughter]\nI mean he had an ... more than a million different\nTweets coming his way ah\nChristine forward replies to

like the\nUh I don't know if that's true I figured it's true I did the research on that I had Blake do the research so we know whatever yeah right no absolutely hey John McCain giving away a thousand

part yes yes rice called a boy how do you pronounce I just thought she was selling lunch I did I ...\nAnd it's right there near Mexico City it's just to the north so I thought maybe you would have been counted by other\nYeah apparently as many as twenty women might have been murdered by this couple it's particularly the guy their debt to find a link is Carlos and Patricia end and they were arrested after pushing a baby stroller full body parts to the streets [noise]\nAlong with that happy Halloween or how do you get the unfriendly going I'm I'm\nReally amazed by this because if I don't get the garbage out quickly enough I hear about it Saturday at chop up twenty women you're pushing their parts in the stroller around town and she's pop it along with you no objections I because they're both\nMentally ill she's not yelling and asking for pre trial diversion [laughter]\nIt says here Carlos has a mental disturbances consistent with psychosis in a personality disorder wow it's so it is the wife and she's been mentally disabled from birth so apparently John she's not really a so she doesn't know what's going on no they admitted this fact he wanted to know if he should dress up to meet the media\nFollowing his arrest so he's he's he's proud of what he did he Carlos admitted to killing ten women gave information about them and detailed down to the clothing they were wearing when he killed them yeah he described it to completely natural way end according to one police force he actually seemed happy to have done this\nHe wants people to see his picture to know his name I Would obviously classify this person has a murderer a serial killer said one police official in an interview\nSo he has a severe psychotic disease yeah mental disease which would qualify him for mental diversion if these crimes are committed America yeah uh because of that that that mental disorder he would not have killed\n... oh you would have definitely qualified for pre trial diversion of California maybe Eighteen and then there's no there's no trial there is no conviction and no jail time\nYeah so this is apparently what happened I I guess this couple's sold clothing and these were a lot of single mothers who came to buy the clothing and they disappeared because this couple killed them\nOne of the uh one of the woman disappeared along with her two month old child that they kill the baby to who was so oh it was sold the baby was sold to another couple before being recovered\nWow uh when he was arrested he told the police if they're going to show me to the media can I take a bath and put on a suit first because I'm not some filthy delinquent they all said that he had raped some of the women before he killed them chase\nThe couple the police got onto the couple after they noticed they had made phone contact with some of the missing women so that's how they got on to them is possibly being the murderers\nAnd then uh then they noticed them walking down the street with the carriage and they got to slow down the ... yeah they're apparently would try to take them somewhere to dispose of the body parts they were trained and they were chopped up body parts piled up here right yeah I imagine they dream of the blood like in the bath tub and then they put them in the stroller and they wouldn't take them somewhere to bury him\nI Carlos said he would often cut his victims into little pieces and end up tossing them into the rivers are burning them\nHe said if he wasn't caught you would have kept doing this the other big Mexico stories that they found a ton of with a rail system\nUnder the border between Mexico and California a sophisticated cross border tunnel that began in a home in the town of how cool less than a football field from the border and you see it's solar powered did you notice\nThat yeah they they had a rail installed already edit solar powered and I'm thinking why don't we get this crew to tunnel through the mountains for the high speed rail I didn't even think of that that there is I Do\nIf these guys do what they're doing you know I Wonder how quick they built this started we much quicker than already it's oh yeah the ... state workers rehab are never going to be able to do it all through the mountains but I think this crew can clearly this was supposed to be a smuggling tunnels either for drugs or people right yeah I Would imagine if they find one or two of these every year\nThey think oh they said based on the total size and technology they think it was mostly for drugs yeah it starts it's no money in drugs and people I Would imagine that they found it where they went into\nA a drug runners house and that's where most of the start that's why they're hard to detect because they start in the basement of a house and they end in the basement of a building here right and so you\nDon't you never see them above ... right right they could sneak in and out so they this is what they did with el ... and they have like a little totally building it in the jail to some other place yes right they tunneled under ground so I could get them out of jail by digging a hole in the yeah they did on the floor if it\nCame out of somebody's house it was like he was going to get totaled over to a safe house and they had a real install too they're really good at installing the rails underground then we ought to hire all I Know a high speed rail would have been done by now it'd be working perfectly if we hired the Mexican drug cartels to build it\nAll right what does or not union union didn't report of the
