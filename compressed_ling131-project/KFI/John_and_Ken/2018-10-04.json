not a good thing for you guys to be de sensitized\nBut why don't you flip it on his side and what does this prevents men from committing sex crimes because now they ... with a robot I doubt that that will ever happen to me now\nBut I doubt what do you said well what in in Pasadena desensitized\nResearch jeeze here's where the world is going because it is unsafe now for men to be alone with women

everything he said was true [laughter] I Know she didn't really think everything he said was true and Kavanaugh's life and his wife and his kids their lives are shattered by a vague accusation most of which she can't remember\nAnd this is what's used to decide is worthiness seeing\nAll these people in the media and all these Democrats squealing today every one of them wants to stop Kavanaugh before the story broke\nAll these people are voting against him even if the story didn't exist all these media people these left is would spread negative news about him even if we never heard from a Christine Blasey Ford\nSo this is them just using the story as a weapon to try to achieve a goal that they couldn't achieve with the regular investigations and the regular hearings that\nCame up with an ad lib a a an audible at the line right fourth down and forty\nThat's what they were facing way and they tried to Hail Mary here you know he figured it out for\nThemselves because he doesn't as you listen to advisors I don't know why the media still goes maybe somebody close to them is telling is nobody closed telling me but I think the reason he stayed out of this\nHe knows there's a few senators especially a couple of Republicans who are you know there are grasping their pearls they're very nervous over there so he tried to just stay out of it from long enough but you know you put them in front of one of his crowds hometown rally Mississippi voters and he just couldn't help himself well I think I think I knew I was coming listening is you\nKnow what we need best thing I like about him he tells the truth and they're uncomfortable truths and they'll go against all the BS that comes out of everybody in the media and the politicians\nAnd Hollywood and academia they all preach ... in religion and a certain conformity of thought\nAnd he's the one who says\nWell actually you're all full of it here's the truth and it may make you queasy uncomfortable and you're going to cut your pearls but here's the truth she doesn't remember anything definitively\nAbout how she got there how she left who were the other people and on and\nOn and they know that the Democrats know that on the Judiciary Committee and elsewhere\nAnd now they've decided to shift the story to focus on Brett Kavanaugh's quote credibility recalling how much he drinks and ... no longer about a possible sex assault well just about how under oath before the committee he missed characterized his youthful drinking that's what they're trying to do now\nWhich reminds me by the Obama Clinton plug the Obama ... by the Obama clip from a couple of years ago an MTV documentary\nFor me when I was a teenager I use\nDrugs I I drank so I pretty much try whatever was out there but I was in Hawaii and it was a pretty relaxed place I was lucky that I\nDid not get addicted except to cigarettes which took me a long time to kick\nMe go okay right that didn't matter what he was running it didn't matter no it didn't matter [laughter] well nobody asked them how much he drank how much body smoke damage cocaine eat a lot because no one came forward accusing him of sex assault that's where all this thing tumbled\nAnd they're like well we'll if you're a drinking problem that you would know if you committed a sex assault did so therefore must assume you did yeah I\nI I'm curious like what what's if his memories impaired by is excessive drinking her memory is impaired by whites\nBecause I've always thought\nYou got these traumatic events or something you can't forget not that you can't remember them but you can't forget them your traumatized you can't get it out of your head us with Trump did and they're very subtly she can only remember she had one beer that's all she could and he was trying to say well

Mr gold belt I appreciate your bravery and coming here today before our committee [laughter]\nI mean you're talking about daylight savings that really is a that was ever on the Senate Judiciary committee I have to practice the boys are it really is amazing that you have come forward to tell your story before the entire ... a sound like you're hung over we they salutes your patriotism and your bravery\nMight look let's talk about Christine Blasey Ford is if you updates ... have you been watching this story now for weeks you\nCan go to a Web site and you know what their political slant is they're going after judge Capitol you can go to another website and you know what they're saying is they're going after Christine Blasey Ford\nFox News for instance apparently she's got an ex boyfriend who's come forward another letter is this true\nIn a written declaration they're they're actually obtained by Fox News his name was redacted in the declaration that's right or he contradicts her testimony that she never helped anyone prepare for a polygraph examination these senators are trying to figure out I was idea it was for red lazy forward to take a polygraph anew paid for it\nAnd you know what's funny I remember that because that prosecutor from Arizona Rachel whenever any Mitchell I I was listening to that point where she was asking and I remember thinking\nIt's kind of a straightforward question lazy Ford seem confused she kept going I don't I don't really understand what she asking well that's where I Am asking you if you got any help and preparing for a polygraph where I've helped anyone I see that I Know and she was like I I Know there was a lot of that especially on a pointed questions that led to the motivation\nFor doing this or the background story because there has to be some democratic uh set up behind the story she couldn't do this all by yourself and I she seemed at the time and of course of the time she's giving this in a heartfelt description of her sexual assault\nBut put putting that story aside she seemed kind of ... to me\nAnd just very fragile and jumpy and uh I I Do I don't think it came from this assault story for thirty six years ago you know I I I just\nWell here's the deal not he said they dated from Nineteen Ninety two to Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he said in his experience you saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was her lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test for so they had one I thought\nSomebody helped her no he's contending that she was helping somebody else with the polygraph yeah what did she was asked under oath if she's ever helped or been helped prepare for a polygraph\nThe woman was Monica McLean she was interfering jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office he also said that Ford never voice any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane and had no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment with one door\nNow her claims are shared terrible fear of flying and that's why for a week the a hearing was delayed because they were negotiating over whether the committee members would come to her\nIn California well it turns out she's flown all over the place and\nShe claimed that she had to have a second exit door installed and that was one of the issues debated with her husband in couples therapy and twenty twelve because she wanted a second exit door because she's claustrophobic and she had panic attacks every time she had a flash back to the assault well he said we've lived at five and a square foot apartment or she did\nAnd um had no problem with that\nNever expressed a fear of close quarters tied spaces are places with only one exit the former boyfriend wrote\nNow who has a credibility problem should we reconvene and redo the testimony\nYou know it's just vote or he also claims that she never mentioned she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time they were dating of course she said she didn't tell anyone until she finally came out in therapy with has been there so I Know that the Sears one of the second front doors important yes the second front door because she said\nThat memory because she never told anybody until twenty twelve so what triggered the memories and twenty twelfth\nShe was in couples therapy with her husband and she said the memories percolated up as they revisited a disagreement they had over her insistence on installing a second front door when they remodeled their home in Palo Alto\nThe need to explain a decision that her husband didn't understand pushed her to say she wanted the door to alleviate symptoms of claustrophobia and panic attacks that she's still suffered from an attempted rape\nI was wondering what happened to him because of all the boards and all all the fake ads he did for banks and for Herbalife and apparently took and remember they they showed is what the income and I think I think he had I was millions I Can't remember now what is his\nAppeal for businessman usually those guys are are hard headed about\nThis incident you know what they hire people in marketing and advertising agencies to go find them somebody and that those are the people that chose for law\nOh geez oh now he's ... he's born somebody's money in Prague and he's too dumb to know a whether you need a visa or not and you could look that up on line and about thirty seconds second late but if you made it to the hotel I guess you didn't need one clock\nI wondered what he was doing census crushing defeat back in June where he did not finish first or second at the governor's race yeah what was it about eighty seven percent of the public did not vote for him and he was rejected soundly and those are the people bother to vote so I guess he's touring the world now to\nBe on a listening tour he's doing a it probably is doing scam worked for a rally various companies\nWhatever oh yeah I'm sure this has been paid for by some oh yeah there there's probably some questionable companies doing a scam job but it's what they said when he was leaving the mayor's office it was concerns about his finances because he lives a lifestyle really enjoy first class stuff\nTravel you know tickets to a big events yeah\nYou don't want to be he's driven around I don't think he even drive so we get a license or it doesn't really care\nLegal limit though is a special license All right well thanks simply that new special license it's one of my hand at for really stupid people [laughter]\nI Wonder what [laughter] I Wonder if he'll survive in the Czech Republic yeah I don't know know around ... they'd like to drink there I was in Prague once and it was during the world cup holy moly wow late at night\nAfter the game's over\nMillions of Eastern Europe likes to drink yeah I Know what about if the Russians like vodka what are the polish people what's their ... to ... to Europe yeah it is yeah but when we were in pricing a sheep or something or it's just easily made\nA I think they make from potatoes and yeah it is cheap no they don't the ... it's not given the same care that whiskey is oh I see [laughter] you know whiskey they will aged for forty years I mean\nYou you know you could you could even you can't even tell from the commercials the whiskey commercials are always complex complex is that they're process you never see a complex process commercial with vodka it's made primarily a voice\nOr an epidural [laughter] that's kinda creepy the basics are the distillation of cereal greens are potatoes that have been fermenting it right yeah how about that I remember so when I get it and you're drinking age and I feel like capital\nThat I was told be careful of vodka because it looks like water it's clear and you drink it you don't realize that you feel like it did not having an effect on you and then move\nYeah it's a liquid potatoes yeah yeah I haven't had any\nVodka in old long time since right after high school yeah so there was a very very bad experience\nProbably the most drinking I did was my early years as an accountant because people like to go out and I one of my favorite drinks was justified took him ... which means it's all a line that I remember those those those were blasted down those yeah one night one time I got really sick ...\nThey had a yeah that was that was the thing I picked over to its why stop by to yeah vodka in just a an ... but it's supposed to be in your genetic makeup I don't know in fact\nIt says here did mine kept polish ... uh what is it would

[noise]\nI'm taking the fence down everything ... dance predictable\nThe FBI report came out last night\nBy long apparently really ah he really interview that many people but every Republican as looked at it including what seems to be the sitting senators seem to be satisfied ready to move on to vote\nWhat do you think the other side said yeah but the other side did that it's not complete they didn't do enough they windows every they need to be over ... know what they really need more time what\nThey really said was there's nothing there\nWho the Democratic senators but that what they're really say oh there's nothing there that's why they want more time it's not directly in other words what but\nWhat you can't take any of these people literally it is all fake theater news there's nothing there because he didn't go around raping people that's why they're stopping their stories what three weeks now\nAnd all the only people have come forward have been crazy women without dish upsurge stories some of which they've already pulled back and all the other stories had not been corroborated by a single living human being\nIt's off farce it was a political hit job\nBut because Republicans hold that swim fifty one to forty nine majority we had to see what some of the senators look like they weren't sure what they were going to do are now going to do and we have a few hints that senator from Maine Susan Collins\nAppears to be a very thorough investigation so that indicates to me that she's ready to vote for ... you know what they wanted\nThey wanted cover maybe you're right they don't want to vote against them but they want to cover because they they did something yeah 'cause she lives in a very moderate liberal state main\nLike most of the New England it's not conservative way Alabama's conservative so you know in order to attempt damn the backlash as she needs of talking\nSo that's why they agreed okay well wait a week will do the investigation it'll turn up nothing there's you're talking point now vote for him\nAgain it's all scripted it's this this ... if\nIf I had written down and put it in the field and blow up a week ago what would happen it would have come out exactly the way I wrote it down there's absolutely\nNo surprises here this this is how vicious and disgusting politics says this is a vicious and disgusting the left wing fanatics are\nThis is why\n... you ought to be voting in November and you ought to be voting or I rarely give out blanket warnings but you really ought to be voting Republican otherwise\nThere's going to be more this garbage because the Democratic party has it made a Democrats anymore it's made of like a left wing fanatics\nAnd muggy and when you see the presidential race in twenty twenty that's who's going to lead the way those Bernie Sanders fanatic idol thing is you know what they're trying to get control of the party here in California they almost did\nYeah I Know and they need they need a big smack down before they're going to ... before they run away they need a huge flush now they can't touch Trump\nBecause he's he's got a vaccine against him he's inoculated right everything's been thrown out I'm already I don't think there's any story they could come up with or any charge or any criticism that go way anyone who\nExactly right I don't think there's anybody on the fence about Trump no right\nThe crowd like some support some are just so he's doing a pretty good job keep 'em and then of course the crowds have them from since day so Trump is gonna is gonna is a master\n... up a hundred percent of his supporters right he'll get his base and he'll get\nAll of his base so the Democrats are going to have to do the same thing and the only way they think they can do that is if they go extreme right they leave the cult and everybody a drink the Kool Aid ah eats the chocolate pudding puts on their purple robe and jumps off a cliff\nSo that that's the kind of race you are going to say you're not you're not going to see you're going to see the ... the wacky as candidate in the Democratic party is going to win the nomination\nSo predictably this afternoon protesters have taken to the streets in Washington DC you against the Kavanaugh nomination this was the same crowd I Would imagine almost exactly that protested Trump's victory in the election until the end they're paid to do that right\nAnd and and and and because you know you know that there's nobody you know right in in a ... if you're if you're a regular person with a regular job in a family you don't have any time to go protesting here is not one vacation day are sick day you've ever taken in your life to protest anything because normal people don't do\nThat these people or abnormal people and they are connected to unions and they're connected to politicians and activist groups and this is their job and and so they're they're paid to do this\nWe have some audio of the protesters in Capitol Hill

reference thing in the whole Brett Kavanaugh circus\nWe've looked at you know the types of coverage we played a clip from US Senator Chuck Grassley who's the chairman of this house and Senate Judiciary committee's Republican from Iowa and basically said you know when the protestors come to my offices in there for and against Kavanaugh the media does not want the interview the pro capital people\nAnd and the and the media or the reporters [noise] hell the pro cabinet crab we're not interested in talking to you we only want to put on the anti capital crap right there blatant\nAbout it so we know since Trump is run for office you know what we're dealing with here is most of the media and he's right kind of the enemy and the root for the Democratic party either because they don't like Trump they don't think this election was write\nA and they'd like to overturn it so that's what they're going to give coverage to plus they found out that you know versus the what was the latter years of Obama workout more boring they're getting a bump in the ratings with these anti Trump people leaving the audience so so Ted Koppel who was a part of the old world when there is\nProjected to some Arab objectivity yeah objectivity and decency and there was that all this hysteria he was on a national press club panel discussion\nWith CNN's Brian ... that were never heard of but John ... is it that way and said yeah ... ... yes filter like ... like this guy he's this fat bald\nIt looks like a power\nHe looks like someone you pay a ... to remove out of your colon\n... and he's ... he's a human pollen\nAnd he's only thirty three years old and he says smarmy pompous sanctimonious as anybody will ever see on television came for the New York times he worked at the New York times he started with his own media block\nAnd then the time she picked him up of course they did he went up the progressive a whack job bladder and then see it it took him\nAnd so he's the chief media correspondent and he has a show on Sunday mornings ... sources where they critique the media yeah anyway here is him and Ted Koppel at this panel discussion in Washington\nMoney money money Donald Trump has been very very good for baseball has been wonderful for the industry\nYour boss or knowledge as much a number of number of months ago during the ... they don't ... it was less known that swing moon has also acknowledged that so does it say in it\nBut that means for ... million friends are up that means what oh the ratings are up it means you can do without Donald Trump\nYou would be lost without Donald Trump words he says no that was true CNN's ratings for being looked toilet without\nYou know that's not true you're you're waiting for the last president to no hold on ...\nWhat were the ratings before Trump and ... now\nI Would say oh we might be up twenty we might be up thirty percent we might be a forty percent if we go back down forty percent that's okay to do it's not will end up going back to the premise that these networks are making so much money off of Trump's enough we we benefit from it that\nWell of course they're making money off of tried doing this you know it's funny because we every now and then we can email from people say oh you guys are just doing this for the ratings\nNo these are actual opinions and we've drawn an audience with our actual opinions would you dreaming consistent over the years what's going on with Jim and talked about and we just before we introduced this clip that Ted Koppel came from the old school\nWhere when you

I don't remember I looked at the map awhile ago but anyway uh this was the one where they claimed that they did with the neighborhood and that wasn't what people said no but anyway Mike bond in our city they were going to take this further\nLike they tried down in playa del ray with mar vista and covert but they got beaten on that one well they got\nThey got this stupid conference in town full of uh oh these ... these government nannies who want traffic restrictions in cities and they want is a bonding and guards said he wanted to show off\nYour stupid road diet to these out of town leaders and uh they got some they got some flak\nFrom the real people with normal people and more of this will give you the whole story\nYeah coming up we'll have John Russo on from keep moving\nComing up after the news at four o'clock well the latest a standardized test scores for the state of California have come out in four years into this new testing program that they use a California once again is stagnant\nUm in fact you know the the good times the cheerleader for the public schools that recognizing their failure\nEven says you have to look on the on the right side of the decimal point to guinea picture progress listen to this in English\nForty nine point nine percent of students met or exceeded state standards in English compared to forty eight point six last year that's what they mean by looked at the right side of the decimal point 'cause that's what that's like seven tenths of a percent increase in improvement in math\nOnly thirty eight point seven met the standard you know a lot of it clearly a third of the student\nIs half half the kids into ... half the kids don't know how to read or write well two thirds of the kids can't add and subtract\nAnd they're all pushed along\nTo the next grade so they'll graduate and you wonder why the poverty rate in LA twenty five percent this is why they're not going to get jobs require any real skills we're we're we're going to be we're going to be told how terribly lopsided the economy is and it's it is walk cited but here's one of the reasons that's not the\nNot the fault the Sacramento\nIt's the fault of the largely Los Angeles teachers' union and the sick advance on the\nOn the school board\nYou have a disastrous school system that's been a disaster now for generations and nobody fixes it and a lot of the English speaking people have are refusing to send their kids there\nAnd uh they they go to private and parochial schools oh yeah they've given up yeah I mean I think I've read that the it is though eighty five percent\nAre Hispanic and the schools and a lot of the kids don't speak English and a lot of the families are too poor to ah to go to a private school\nAnd and everyone's desperately trying to get in at a charter school ... system failure\nIt's a terrible terrible system failure and and meantime the teachers and I think Ninety eight percent approved it is uh they they authorized to strike if Shiites or don't go well and apparently they're not going well and they want retroactive raises and I'm thinking you know what you're you're all gross\nTeacher and we were always told them not all the teachers yeah you get to Ninety eight percent yet solved as he gets all the teachers draw your voting you want to bleed more money out of the system and you know you you have no interest in the kids you all have resigned I mean imagine that half the kids can't read two thirds gave to math\nJust resign just don't take it don't take any more of our money that the whole thing has to be bulldozed there's no fix for this\nWhat was strange about this they changed the testing system awhile back many questions on the test or multiple choice but a correct answer produces a harder question to follow well a wrong answer yields an easier next question they call it the adaptive test\nThere so they try to dumb down the test to see for somebody who doesn't know what they're doing if they get the question wrong with the next one's easiest hopefully get something right or it gets easier and easier yep right 'cause they keep missing them it gets easier and easier till they are and we will actually get something right so means you can't even trust the numbers which means the numbers are worse\nThan what they report yeah because they ... the test I've never heard of that given\nBut it's easier questions after they blow one I've never\nAnd of course they're really hand wringing over the race gap thirty two percent of black students Mitt the standard and reading compared with Seventy six percent of Asians and sixty five percent of\nWhite students and even Latino Z or they they\nWent up a little higher than the black students but also a big gap there particularly for Latinos but uh yeah I heard the same thing for\nThat going on and exhausted by it ups the people who run the place don't want to fix it I avoided\nLA unified for all three of my kids had just been fortunate on it and but that's what we had to do 'cause we didn't trust the ... I visited one elementary school yeah and um I realized very quickly talking with the principle\nThat even though it was considered a good school on the west side\nIt was it it it was like a from a cancerous body it's like the\nYeah the some doesn't have cancer in it yet but the rest of the body does so eventually the thumb is going to get cancer and died two\nAre coming up next the road diet on the west side and the community of mar vista of LA Venice Boulevard effected they truncated a lean in each direction quite a while ago\nBut you know the only city government wants to Tibet is a big success the great street is what they call it talk about next with John Russo co founder and co director of keep LA moving\nChina can show jeopardy Marquez venues calf I Am six forty\nWeekends KFI are a little bit different ball for your meal what do you what did really well on whipping up some cure for Sally Ride all three of them so bacon and eggs so [laughter]\nThat's always a way to start today it's grown you probably know that handled the lawyer but did you know you wear robes and aware ... when he does handle 'em off and I'm like okay we're\nNot we're going we're got news any talk that would surprise you weekends on KFI start buying into\nK pacify deal with the Los Angeles Orange County Herman not\nGiving up I'm Deborah Martin live from the KFI twenty four hour news from the LA county sheriff's department has ... refocus rather on the case of a man killed while heading to work KFI is Chris and Carlo reports lived a family of the man killed searching for closure and the answers\nFor ... for a modern\nGuy we're going to have to get back to Chris and we get a better connection the man who helped start death row records has been sentenced to twenty eight years in prison for killing a man with a striking Compton one daughter the man killed told the court today that said should night what he did was senseless\nMy dad's a\n\n... ... ... wrong by\nNIH pleaded no contest last month to voluntary manslaughter for the twenty Fifteen incident which happened\nAn argument on the set of the movie straight ...
