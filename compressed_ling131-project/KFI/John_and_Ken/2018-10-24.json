ratcheting up way I'm not for a second right I'd say how you doing yeah that was scary the odds that later I'm getting off yeah\nOr or you say well odds are happen twice a month\nIt's an eighty six North American eighty six is what they called it ... the plane itself and apparently I was developed in the Nineteen thirties and he's used as a training aircraft by us pilots during World War two and then they\nPainted it with this German All right so it's not a real German so ... you know so what the air shows they pretend to have a dog fight in the crowd watches a while to get that right right [noise] that's more ... to to you know they don't do that\nWell they probably have a sound effect because it's dog fights as we were shooting at each other in the air oh sounds Snoopy against the red beret and you remember the song\nYeah yeah I remember about the role of guardsman and the other war guy like I don't know I'm not I I like whatever that song I always get uncomfortable\nWhen war

public vote on the matter on the matter yes that's correct and that\nIs a big reason to support this because then you will be in control and you know it's great voters rarely raise taxes on themselves and everybody uses gas\nSo what do you think the odds are that are it'll never happen it'll go a hundred years they won't raise the tail raise taxes on the wealthy goes the smokers 'cause that's not that significant percentage of the population only impediment\nWe have here spiritually most of the state is with us there on the right side but a lot of people don't\nUnderstand the ballots summary

in the law but none of the money could be used\nTo add new lanes or build new freeways\nThere's nothing in the law that permits the money to be used to streamline traffic it's not allowed to write and and and remember they're taking forty percent off the top to use it for non road projects\nForty percent off the top and then further money is then spent\nFor non road projects or administration overhead very little is going to go to the road less than half and that's that's just the history of how they they spend ... tax money it's the same thing again it's gonna be siphoned off it's always

only way you can ensure this happens if everybody wants to repeal the gas tax tells everybody else say no because odds are about two thirds or more of the people you don't want to repeal it too they just have to know and they have to be motivated to get up in the morning and vote right there's a lot of people want to repeal the gas tax who may not to bother to vote and that would be a terrible shape\nAnd to show you I mean forty five million dollars to know people have\nWe just talked to rosy she's a she and her husband own active auto body\nShe came back up John during that break and she

approached by called the mile reform California and they had the idea that we should repeal Josh Newman first\nBecause he was the weak link there in a district as easily been won by Republicans in the past and he thought that would be a good way to start the campaign get him out first then we'll work on repealing the gas tax what we did that in our own face too\nAnd I explain to listeners about face three 'cause that's also important that we get to them about twenty twenty that's going to make sure that the gas tax is spent on the roads ... will trust called the miles organization to drafted correctly yeah it'll it'll athlete\nRushing just the way the money is allocated in budget so that much much more money goes towards fixing and building\nRoads they now get diverted got diverted a couple of times there is a forty two people voted I think\nEven I got a hotel linked into voting for that and prop one eight years ago same thing it was supposed to be on the gas tax money can you know one of the road there but I really had another downturn you know the market's gonna dump they're gonna wanna steal this money they steal all the money they dumped today\nWell yeah but I they're

means that some people did not going to vote and those those are probably the people that don't know anything about ... am I going to keep them away yeah so I'm a little\nLower turnout the better because you want to reduce the number of stupid people\nThat are in the voting to the low for a nation voters no information low information low IQ voters but no information no IQ voters' rights they mess everything up but I mean just look at California they get taken by those annoying you know I'm six commercials you people in part because you listen to us every day\nAnd we interact everyday is

dollars to other politicians and from these construction companies to prop up the no side you know so you can't\nFight union money if I mean you you can fight it but you can't out spend the unions have just\nA phenomenal amount of money out of their lives and they they hoard their money for moments like this and they work with each other there's unions that have really no say on the gas tax they have no claim on the gas tax but they will help out and donate money any way because they'll expect these construction unions to help them when\nWhen they turn pops up so it union money\nIs just always overwhelming but they're selling ally we've got the truth they've got a lot so\nWe are going to see how that works out yeah and I don't know that we've ever seen this before where you have something on the ballot\nWhere people don't understand a percentage of them don't understand what it is and they're being deceived by the title in the summary is voting no when they really would want

broadcasting live in Anaheim active auto body we thank out and rosy named are the owners were set up and wonderful front of their hair they support yes on sex and the address\nIs Ninety four east oh go go oh orange or Oregon\nRight near Lehman were right up to Ninety One free but you it's great to besides the sonic that's the biggest frequencies candy I think I've ever seen a ... is that right I didn't notice they know they're like a factory that's yeah that's\nBig five is near us Wal Mart's terrorists so if you look at our voter guy Johnny can a calf I Am six forty and you scroll down we've picked up people running for various offices around Southern California who've impressed us one of them standing here it's Jeff you it he's currently the mayor of ...\nWhich he told me about a thousand people a thousand five and he's running for riverside county board of supervisors what's that district number ... district a district by district five which includes Kevin makes in some other a little towns\nYeah ... it's actually the city's Marino valley mad at the Paris Beaumont banning it in ... city\nLet's recap the reason that we picked you out and this was something you did that was great concerning exorbitant pensions for public employees wants to tell us again that story\nOkay so I had an opportunity has pushed into a situation where I had to change my fire department 'cause I can no longer afford Cal Fire they've gotten too expensive they are trying to force too many new firemen honest\nAnd I wasn't going to raise taxes everybody here doesn't like raising taxes I Know so so what I did is I looked around and I found out that we can do kind of a hybrid and former own in house fire department I pushed out the union\nAnd what I did after I was all done a year and a half of a lot of hard work and a lot of intimidation from some very powerful forces that didn't want to see a succeed\nToday we have an Eighteen firefighters and they're all all on four O. one K. sustainable pensions I\nWe're actually saving seven hundred thousand dollars a year on a five million dollar budget right now and in two years it'll be a million dollars so by percentages I don't think anybody's done that\nFor at least thirty or forty years in California I'm trying to set an example and now we're starting to get a lot of other cities they're looking at it\nAnd they're starting to talk to us they have to because their budgets are getting destroyed by pensions where we have what I think you brought it up a show or two ago uh there's there's at least twelve right here in LA county not here now but in LA county twelve different cities that are raising their taxes anywhere and you don't have time for one and a half a cent pack\nAnd that's just that that's that's just unsustainable and what they're doing isn't it ties in with actually what we're doing today\nIs you know prop six is is so great we were actually one of the very first city set off a letter with our entire council said no one is the one we set it up to the ledge said who said no\nYou guys have been behaving badly we're not going to go ahead and reward you for behaving badly now later on I went down to the California transportation commission and San Diego see all the different ah grass that they're handing out\nNone of them had fixing potholes snow so\nSo if you think that this is going to change anything would make your roads better and if you're going to listen to a higher patrolman or a firefighter who's being paid to say that those and I mean really what do they know I mean for instance the one guy on the despite the firemen makes made three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars last year from Chula Vista\nYeah he's leaving the ad yeah he's doing it right there on vacation and uh so\nSo what I got as my opponent that I'm running for actually he's the one that when he was in the assembly\nHe's the one that uh he introduced a eighty nine oh two an eighty five fifty five which allowed double dipping for police and firefighters right that's how you get to three hundred Seventy five fell all my gosh and then also they did the bargaining unit eight which did the desk power which put firefighters just you know if people knew what they make\nAnd there's there's a thousand applicants for every job yeah\nAnd there's there's a there's a lot of dues money because they are in a lot of money so they pay a lot of dues money ... money is used to bribe politicians it's used for all of his the disinformation campaigns on these propositions it's a real racket\nWell they're afraid to all all of the all of the we got six uh unions that represent the twenty two thousand workers in riverside county we are also the largest we're the largest employers of ... after the state\nIs that right yeah because Orange County LA county and they have their own but there are messed up to their defined benefit ... exactly so you know hopefully when I get in there I can go ahead and and convince and I I'll ... union leader said look if you really care about your your ah members we've got to cut us off and have all go to four one K.\nBecause you've got to go ahead and fix the hole and the bottom of the vote otherwise you're going to be bailing until you die and waiting to see this tax prop six you know if that's the one if it stays in it'll all end up being\nIs for pensions they ask that have been around a long time that's where that's where the money's going to go this gas expert he's going to end up bailing out pension failed pension says right right because when the economy collapses again they're gonna have to grab this money like they always do and by the way and that's what they're doing it on purpose they know eventually that the whole system's going to collapse and they're going to have\nExtra pots of money to fill the pension holes so they're setting themselves up in advance they say now Oh yes we're going to build your summer they're not going to build any Roche they're not going to fix any Roach what they're going to do is put this aside for the pension hole that's how they play their game\nAnd let me put this one more thing how many people remember prop Thirteen okay no process was a pivotal moment in the in California politics\nMuch like when a President Reagan went ahead and broke the unions would tackle those are all my over we're on the verge of another pivotal moment\nWe can win this if we push this will be one that we look back on and when we we passed prop six this could be one of those pivotal moments that goes ahead and gets people realizing that we can take our state back and and that's what's so important for riverside\nCounty board of supervisors on the voter guide is currently mayor kind of make the tickets are backing coming up next we'll be checking with ABC News for care if I ever pieces packages explosive\nPackages were sent to a lot of democratic politicians around the country yesterday and today Johnny can show Deborah Marquez news KFI is exporting\nListens to KFI pocket a Kohl's grand theft auto valet parking their next chance to win happens\nWithin twenty minutes\nOkay bass Angeles Orange County I her radio station bomb\nScares I'm Deborah Martin live from the calf twenty four hour newsroom crudely made by pipe bombs have been sent to several high profile Democrats including former President Obama and Hillary Clinton similar packages have been sent to CNN\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder and California Democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters believes in New York City said the explosive devices seemed to be sent by the same person who sent one this week too liberal billionaire George Soros a major contributor to democratic causes\nThis egregious conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans\nPresident Trump has condemned the attempted bombing attacks which he calls despicable act\nIn these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nHe says the full weight of the government is being used to investigate the packages and bring those responsible to justice to people who've been fatally shot at a grocery store in Kentucky it happened on the outskirts of Louisville one person has been arrested the LAPD has now the crew known as the region burglars\nUh and and they all had or at least at least five of the six we know it had Debbie Wasserman Schultz as the return address and this is the Florida congresswoman the former chairwoman of the DNC and so\nUh one of the devices we know actually the one that was addressed to attorney general Eric Holder\nNever got to that destination and in fact was rerouted to the return address which is why Debbie Wasserman Schultz is officers in Florida were evacuated day because it's believed\nThat while she was not addressed to one of the packages her address or return was until the package when they're so most of these through the postal service which is also part of the concern here is about whether or not there are still more packages within the postal service that's a real possibility\nAnd there was like white powder and some of them\nYeah at the CNN headquarters that they did find in on below with white powdery side of it I was actually the lingering issued as to why they it took so long to get everybody back\nInside the time Warner headquarters in the CNN building was because uh they had rendered the their excuse me not rendered but moved the pipe bomb device outside of the location the end of the containment trucking left up but they still had this on the little white powder in it and that\nActually involved some forensic testing I I don't know too much about the entire process of that but basically they had to uh make sure that there's a substance whatever it was was contain\nOfficials really haven't given us an update on that but we know that the time Warner center is back open as well as CNN and so uh we understand that obviously at some point they decided that it was safe or not a threat or they had moved it as well off site\nSo we don't know for sure if they were capable of exploding well\nSome of them were are some of them certainly appear to be legitimate devices and the FBI has said that they did believe that these were devices intended to kill or name that is what they have said which to them\nMeans that these were lived devices with a real possibility of a threat whether or not the devices work is another issue a and and whether or not that's the reason none of them exploded is another issue or where they just intercepted in time that's another question\nAnd the ones that are sent to like Clinton's in Obama's they never get anywhere close to the actual\nTargets I guess the way the mail system works right\nYeah absolutely and I'm ... it seems like the one that may have gotten the closest to its actual destination\nA potentially was the one that was sent to George Soros is home\nUh and then the one that actually was delivered to CNN or but as for the one that was the Obama residents in DC and the one that was sent to the Clinton home in New York those are intercepted well ahead of time and the fact that a sorting facility\nOr and then the one that was also sent to a a Maxine Waters the Democratic congresswoman was intercepted at a congressional male sorting facility\nAnd the U.S Secret Service which still has protection\nOn Hillary Clinton on former President Obama they intercepted that as part of routine male inspection they said and it may not be that surprising that they catch this stuff or you know a package being sent to a former president or former secretary of state\nWithout you know any expectation of that package coming that might send up a red signal or red flag right there\nMark thanks for the update on the story we appreciate it absolutely thank you guys\nKnow mark rental aren't NBC News for ... on these explosive devices that were sent to a number of democratic politicians and we couldn't forget CNN and also I think the or else you're gonna do times allegedly had some sort of scared of San Diego union Tribune newspapers interesting\nThat the return address on some of them was Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that they were trying to frame or as a lot of that add to the confusion in case the case\nThey are any of 'em are return they'd end up at her office All right we're

it to us so that's fine as long as it's got the right message drugs it fits that fits me that's all it matters yeah absolutely so you know and it was just talking to build a sailing is running for that legislative seat held by or\nA Democrat by them Sabrina Cervantes have voted for the gas tax and she's the one that got the goodies remember they yeah they gave her a whole bunch of money in the bill SP one to illegally brought her\nTo vote for the gas attack yeah district that she thought about that as I could lose my seat and thank God maybe she was going to lose their seats terribly corrupt tasted awful what she's done to Rome people but it's all her constituents that voted for her are going to pay an extra eight hundred dollars a year every year for this gas and carpet\nBut this what people have to do I mean bill is thirty two years old he quit his job\nThe U.S attorney's office to run and serve in Sacramento I mean that's hard to believe very few good people want to do that what we're up against we need thousands more like him to step up and do that I Know control of the government back and that was a bad people\nAre vastly outnumbered by good people but the bad people all get into politics so they have the majorities and then the good people have to live under their terrible rules\nAnd it's not easy easier I mean if he wins you know he'll be on our show regularly and you'll ... you know he's going to see it up close and 'cause we've had other a decent people go to Sacramento and then come and tell us I was like holy hell you can't imagine\nHow you made it it is say panic up there it is horrible and junk Apollo he says it's our job as taxpayers association dumb billions and billions they haven't proposed tax increases that thankfully haven't seen the light of day yet now and and you know what they're stupid\nThey don't care how much damage they do there are a lot to do your life they spent much of their time eating drinking and having sex with one another\nIt's just it just thought it was actually solve to one another as lobbyists yeah I mean it's just it's just awful up there it's it's a Brussels what it is now absolutely I mean that's what you have you have a situation particularly in the Democratic party\nBut the public employee unions just control them in control everything that happened to the state has been like that for far too long people need to wake up perhaps six is one way for people to wake up because we're going to be able to vote on future gas and car tax increases we're going to take it away from Sacramento and give it to the people because they've been incredibly a response to take it away [noise]\n\nAnd what are the chances of getting gas tax increases if the people vote on it pretty slim zero although we're already at the highest should need any increases for many years to come I think the public is only voted for one broad base tax increase in the last hundred years\nUnder your yeah hundred years yeah
