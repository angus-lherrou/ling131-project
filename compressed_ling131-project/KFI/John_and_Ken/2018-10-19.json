poll released this week says it is dead even\nBut that's often not good for yes side on the campaign so we gotta work work work or some people know what's the gas tax repeal they are going to say\nI'd ever more of a couple of questions to ask you alright earthquakes a bit of the news is we have a story in front of me that says nine wise that have been told about earthquakes nice Mitt may miss so much can you guess one of them because people always had these cliches in their head about earthquakes\nIs going to go stand under a doorway correct\nThat is on the list in fact when we pull that out because there's no you're going to pick that one um 'cause I'm here to\nGet into a doorway to be safe in modern day houses the doorways and the safest place in an earthquake\nUSGS geological advise you to drop cover and hold on you should drop to your hands and knees to prevent yourself from being knocked over to cover under a table or desk to protect yourself from flying objects and hold on to the shelter to stop it from shifting\nThe idea that the door which a safe place goes back to the nineteenth century when homes in California were made from adobe\nOr substance of crumbled easily in quakes often the only thing left standing was the door for him so there you go\nOkay I won't go under doorway\nAnother big lie earthquake can be predicted I don't know why people believe that one another good one is that earthquakes or a weather thing\nHad some friends since I moved to California many years ago who told me oh it's road quake whether it's really hot and dry because it looks like the desert and it just feels like the ground is going to crumble it's not true I hate when people say that earthquakes can occur and rainy weather dry weather any weather cold weather or hot weather\nAnimals can predict earthquakes not true did you believe that one\nNo I didn't because I never had a pet that that did anything right before an earthquake\nA well I imagine you're the dogs and cats\nRight well I have never had a cat but I've had dogs and\nDumping out of business one small earthquakes relieve pressure from a full to prevent the for the larger quake also not true they do really some energy from a fault but not enough to ward off a big nasty shake the follow up there you go [noise]\nEarthquakes happen in the morning you know that one I never hurt but apparently some people believe that and apparently earthquakes and obviously this one to turn the gas off\nOnly do it if you smelled gas or suspect the leak\nAccording to a PG and E. ... that's who says don't do that\nOr depending on how many customers without gas service it may take an extended period of time for PG need to turn your guest services back on if you turn it off as a precaution All right so you say you should learn how to turn it off but you shouldn't turn it off of meeting this you know get big I did that for you because\nYou know I Need some sleep yeah no it's tired of worrying are never north ridge was early in the morning and some people think things are there so yeah it was it for I was in the bay area for thirty yeah and I remember I was working at a radio station and there was a flash\nIn my whole family lives out in the valley that went on the flip side\nThe big one that hit the Loma Prieta through the hit the world series in Nineteen eighty nine that was in the business\nI have a clock so so there's no ... yeah there's no rhyme or reason to it\nBy John Manley is coming on next to talk to us about this big news today the U.S see who is proposing a two hundred and fifty

volunteered with the city's police activities league it's an after school rec program for kids ages six to Seventeen years old but you know there's been suspended after he was arrested yesterday when cops got a tip\nAbout alleged abuse dating back to the nineties you know accused of sexually assaulting for young males at that program and there could be others you learn is expected in court next week he's in jail now on two million dollars bail Monica ... KFI do\nOfficials in riverside county have arrested forty five people and a six month operation targeting the county's biggest gang\nWhen you look at the guns that were taken off the streets and out of the hands of these violent gang members that gives you a little bit of a sense of what our police officers that patrol this city in this county what they face day in and day out\nUs see the worst part about this is the lawyers involved um [noise] uh who who did\nThis I was going to ask you how are they uh\nWell it's ... and um other other firms that do large class action try them look if somebody wants to file a class action that's I suppose that's up to them we've never filed class actions are these cases because they hurt victims but they've had the case Ninety Days they've done very little work and they're asking the court for thirty million dollar fee\nThat's pretty good deal for the lawyers not so much for the the victim who gets twenty five hundred dollars\nAnd so forth fight this and um you know we've seen this before you remember the mirror Monterey case can serve LA USD paid four hundred thousand a piece for these kids who you know some of whom I didn't see ... cookies for a year\nAnd other horrific things have been done to him by their teacher mark bird\nAnd we said we're not doing that you don't we don't have the documents we don't know who did what we don't know what happened and it turns out we we and we eventually went to trial settle the case for one point eight million apiece in trial and found out that Eli us the had known about him for years for years and made substantial changes in policy there\nAnd so the federal cases without any information what that any disclosure taking a thirty million dollar fee and running\nThat's cowardly in my opinion and it's not the best interest of our clients now\nDoes it help you to wait to see we don't have a criminal case against symbol yet\nYeah no it does I mean it does I think it's really important that play out um you know the da ... or ... the LAPD is launched the largest investigation and this history it's a single perpetrator the district attorney's office was working really hard\nUm they've interviewed dozens of our clients were not going to you know we're not going to pull the rug out from them and and and take Nichols on the dollar and take money and act like this case is about money because it's not but I Will tell you that you know these women this is not like he groped some of these\nPress one time and have a nice day I mean this is horrific stuff\nUm he was so bad he was abusing these women putting his hands and in on glove cans and the rectum so there were ... doing things I Can't even imagine talking about sex toys\nAsking them to come to his boots or a photo come to a company that he was running and have them take sexy pictures with him he was taking pictures of their genitalia they kept that he told them it was for political reasons at wasn't he was using them for sexual reasons\nThat the horror the he was committing at the USC medical center for Thirty years is unbelievable and basically\nIf you want to if you're a woman and you wanted a guy a logical care he had to go to him right he was the only joy ... so\nWhat USC is doing here is there really tapping their liability\nUnder the guise of helping somebody and basically telling people what we're going to give George Kendall two hundred and fifty million dollars 'cause that's what they're doing they're paying two hundred and fifty million dollars he gets where at least we didn't let nearing Larry Nassar get released when we settled with Michigan State it's wrong\nI Wonder this before you go John are we looking at like we did with the priest sex abuse scandal in somewhat with the school districts are what we were seeing more cases where women coming forward about these going to college as soon as another location right here in Southern California of course Larry Nassar announcing dull you wonder if this was going to be the next big thing\nI Hope not because you know there's there's there's a you know my daughter's in medical school there was a lot of good da da da ... it's not good I mean we got this case in orange county we've got this case we got Larry Nassar and you know it appears that\nYou know you had another trusted profession has been using their their power in position to access people sexually and I think we have to have a conversation in this country about what this means\nUm and ... and and you know how we deal with this because it's it really is a problem and it's and it's a problem that affects people profoundly\n'em and you know this is not a this is this is a terrible at the ... you know I went to USC and the ... one of the saddest things for our clients spoken to today is they love us see they love the university and they feel betrayed\nAnd um you know and yeah and I don't think they're ever going to get that feeling back and and I don't think the university is going to recover from this I think they have gone the way of Penn State Michigan State and that's really a shame\nAll right John Manley thanks for coming on again in clear in clarifying this whole story\nThanks Ken nice to talk to two days in a row Sir John Manley and again he represents many accusers of George Kendall\nThe former gynecologist to USC student health clinic don't be fooled by the headlines is two hundred and fifty million dollar proposed settlement does not represent a lot of the women were still accusing and it was still part of the case
