leader of a grass roots organization keep Pasadena moving and he wanted us to know that tonight in Pasadena in the regular council meeting it's not just about the road died actually says the measures on his item number fourteen\nOn the city council public hearing section the meeting begins at seven o'clock\nAnd if you're in Pasadena it and you know about the orange grove road diet you might want to go and just check this out because they will be voting on whether or not to proceed to the next step of the orange grove wrote diet or to table\nAnd Frank told us when I had him on friday at there's good reason to believe that they may give up on the orange grove plan\nAs they sit in their news release more than a thousand people in the neighborhood posted science urging the city to listen to local residents and stop a lean reduction on orange grove and then there was over Fifteen hundred Pasadena\nResidents who signed a petition to stop the project because as always as we found out in the west side down in playa del ray the numbers when out most people drive a car and most people hate traffic and most people will be very angry if you're taking away road lanes\nAt all it was a matter of what they're for don't reduce road Lynch please white is really what we need to get through most traffic jams but instead\nRoad diets are about taking away road lanes to get you out of your car and they're being pushed by politicians who are being pushed by activists people on bicycles and people who walk\nThe walk all the time I really do I walk a lot of miles in any given with a lot of steps in any given day have I ever thought wow\nEspecially walking around here in Burbank you know what it's like to see I'd like to see some leans taken away so they can be more pedestrian safety really 'cause everybody will be going slow will be stuck in traffic and if I Want to cross the street will get killed\nI never even considered that before I don't know who these people are where they come from a ... dream up the stuff you know the out of your mind\nTo take away road lanes in LA in Southern California and some of the toughest places to drive there isn't a U.S\nSo if you ah are interested in you want to go it's tonight beginning at seven it probably won't get to this part of the agenda until later on so if you can't get the right away but Franken will probably talked him tomorrow\nMorning me this doesn't mean that they will move onto another road died I Do best it's just so [laughter] it may be they'll just say well this one probably is it appropriate the design of it is not going to work\nThat on the flip side\nOf the road diet story some bad news today from the mar vista neighborhood of LA\nWhere after nearly Thirteen Years as the anchor of more vistas

um [noise] cultivating different chicken and beef and doc basically from clusters of chicken and beef and duct cells that they'd been just replicate and put on to some sort of a structure\nYeah they use a scaffolding and it's kind of interesting because with the advent of three D. technology and being able to three D. print things ... um you know they're finding ways to build the scaffolding and when it comes to food some of them are actually going to be edible\nSo they're building at a scaffolding yeah well so eventually what will see is not just the chocolate bunny at Christmas or I'm Sorry IT stirs usually when they come out the ... ones are [laughter] that's when you get the earlier about nine months old um you will see\nFake turkey in the shape of turkey like a fake cook turkey potentially\nIn the shape of a cook I don't know that you could call it they eat the whole thing it's real turkey it's turkey sells turkey meat is it a fake baby if it's in vitro no but that was entirely a cellular a little a base will there's\nIn vitro process of the prophecies as well for some of these it's really kind of bizarre as how this\nHow this is taking place and they keep they keep jumping over a lot of these hurdles and you may be seeing lab grown fish\nComing to a supermarket sooner than later and the ... the the beef is going to follow and all of these things are are now more rapidly coming to reality\nAnd not just science that when you say this though and I mean just to talk about the the scaffolding thing and how important\nThe aesthetics of a piece of meat can be yeah that's the history now that ... where you've got yes you can have you can have fish lab grown fish that you then take the Fonz and throw out and you're a little container there but it damn well better look like fish or it's not going anywhere\nOh yeah absolutely and then on the other end of that is when you get into a larger institutional style you know whether it's prisoner hospital or hotel or something like that\nThey're going to just back up a truck and a giant rectangular you know piece of solid is going to come out and there's going to slice off little pieces of fish and they're going to call ... anybody\nFor protein junk it's gonna be a low for a loaf of law do butter have you ever looked up loaf the prison loaf yes okay yeah so that's I think that there is a prison low [laughter] there are serving prison low\nUm ... ... this has a lot\nOf ethical ramifications and I'm economical and\nEcological ramifications I mean\nOn the positive side or you mean all of a positive I mean there there's a lot of positives here but there are hurdles we have to get over so imagine this\nIf you could if you're using a scaffolding that scaffolding is not going to the ... biological um shoots and ladders that ours do as individuals now you and I are almost a hundred percent of like when you when you break things down right you know the DNA ... we have mutations\nThat make you a particular colored me a particular color eyes airline all these things right back to you have one [laughter] um [laughter]\nThe things that make changed but really as human beings we're you know pretty much all the saying well uh but those mutations make or structure if your if your building it if you're building that scaffolding there's no reason to vary it\nSo you could have identical pieces of meat\nForever but imagine so less waste you could make them to size the scale to to a particular dish without having you could you could modify how much wrestle how much fat how much you could really it's going to be interesting as to where this ends up\nGoing on almost sounds like you'd also have the sort of the sourdough starter style um strains of different kinds of meat so that you ... you ... ... one particular cow\nThat is particularly tasty ends up providing the starting points for all of these different strains but basically the same genetically the same ... absolutely oh sounds good is going to be [laughter] well I mean I mean look at the hands of areas like that see we got him to uniformity of places like Burger King and McDonalds\nFan one cow that was supplying all of the hamburger for the entire franchise the only thing\nGoing to be interesting one of the battles right now is name nobody knows what to call it fish know that they legally you can't not all the way in the same sense clean to me is one of the ones that is you know leading the pack\nA lab grown meat sounds weird background sounds weird or in vitro meat sounds weird [laughter] uh so they literally are looking\nSynthetic meat cultured meat is okay but sounds a little weird they're trying to find I think it clean meat will is going to be one of the leaders because it doesn't sound ... yeah but it almost sounds bleach ... ...\n... it's been through ... yeah we've we've ... we've been through a process but clean being you know kind of like hey it's not going to harm your words\nYou know not hurting the environment or whatever the animal that came from yeah or the innocence slaughter free food\nYou just take out a little slice of fillet leave the cow standing and then go cook your burger and stare at it while you're eating that's exactly how it goes but wait yeah you won't have to kill the calf aren't Neal thank you so much thank you Neal surveyed with a fork reporter

we got a hold of concerning tomorrow's town hall meeting which is going to be as you just heard Westminster elementary school an avid Kenny diversity bonding will be there it's one of the it's called the bridge home\nTown hall and as you know this is part of the plot to plunked down one of these LA city sanctioned homeless encampments\nPeople's neighborhoods you've seen the revolt in Korea town we've covered the revolt in San Pedro in Sherman Oaks now we're going to talk about the one going on and finish so let's bring on mark right back but the event of stakeholders association and mark your I was told you're aware of that video\nActually I'm totally a scholar who's the filmmakers is a good friend and um I was pleased to be some assistance to him in crafting a script and I'm quoting him in the right direction um yeah\nWell I mean we can't dodge for every statistic in story that was told in the video but it certainly is alarming and makes the point that you guys don't feel like you were represented how long was just in the works is planned for this empty a lot to be turned into a homeless encampments\nWell originally was scheduled to become affordable and market rate housing 'em and when the mayor came up with is sort of face saving proposal to put these a bridge housing temporary shelters in each of the council districts\nI'm a councilman decided without\nTalking to anyone I'm In the community that\nHe would sort of sort of jump ahead of the plan development or by the MTA of this site for affordable and market housing and just use it for three years for a temporary shelter and just in the last I'd say Seventy two hours he has gone from a hundred bed\nTo a hundred and fifty bad again with no consultation with anyone I mean he's ... he's moving very quickly uh to implement the mayor's desire I think I I think cynical about it but I see it as a as a way to the want any criticism he gets in his run for president\nThat is wholly a ineffective at dealing with the ... the tremendous level of homelessness we have in this in this city\nRight hang on mark 'cause that's the point we've been making now for much since exactly what this is this bridge home thing is to try to fend off criticism that's going to come as way as he considers and probably use we can see already running for president report is going to start asking questions about LA's homeless probably want to get this bridge home program and again\nWhat do you find people here a hundred and fifty people here on this one at Venice is large and we'll talk about\nActually how it's going to be constructed mark ... is my guest he's with the Venice stakeholders association and there's a big town hall\nTomorrow night well to talk of another aspect of this exactly who was invited who's going to be there it's hosted by bonding and guard setting of course it's probably a PR dog and pony show to bolster their efforts to plunked down this homeless encampment there in Venice is pretty close to the beach if you look at the video it's nice but\nThe real things you've got to understand look at the wide shots from above and you'll see all the residents who live around this plant

a squatters takeover of a home in Torrance\nThe person at least coming on as a person manages a four bedroom bedroom rental home in Torrance that apparently the owner recently discovered squatters had taken over looks like maybe maybe not the answer to phony Craig's list than somebody pretending that they were renting out the place and\nThey went in there they'll they failed to produce the lease for this home that they said they got from this guy through Craig's list it's obviously not from the actual\nHomeowner but the thing you're going to hear about when we talk about this next hour is just how the laws are on the side to these people at least for a while they do have some rights since they've established like a residence in there\nAnd you know although a lot of homeless don't like live inside and I don't think this family if you want to call it that it's been hanging out in this Torrance homes necessarily homeless but boy\nYou ... what ... they are and stuff they tried to pull on this poor homeowner who of course one of them are victims but then soon and let them stay a little while longer to get their act together is that they know they turn around and said no we're not we're not leaving right now\nSo we'll talk about all that with the manager of the rental home in Torrance after the news\nAt three o'clock I you know kids like to bring treats to school to share with

homemade cookies than headed them out the classmates to eat at ... high school in Davis and\nAll your time is an investigator have you ever come across the report like this one\nNo place are invested in the morning mixed went into a batch of sugar cooking the human Ashville cookies were brought on the campus and passed out to classmates at least in our students' age the cookies\nI have not heard of anybody getting sick or ... as far as physically or physiological by\nEither working or confirmed through individual students were part of the morbid baking plan putting your relatives remains ended a cookie ingredients the remains allegedly once belonging to the body of one of their grandparents so famous join Unified School district spokesperson issued a statement the district cannot comment on confidential student matters\nAnd wrote this case has been particularly challenging and we have responded appropriately and the most respectful and dignified way possible\nNow Davis police are working to uncover more about these morbid cookie claims and exactly what crime could be charged\nBecause of the fact that this is so unconventional would um would take more research\nUsing grandparents ashes as cookie ingredients and serving the cremated remains to unsuspecting students it is a head scratcher Pharr Davis please say their evidence comes from students testimony they have not tested any of the ... the ah in this particular case at this point\nI that's from reporter Steve large CBS Thirteen in Sacramento but they're ...\nYou know again well why not chemical animals ... it's a man\nWell I question the story even though I Love it they have not tested the cookies yet this could just be like an urban legend that got passed around the school oh my God mark\nPut his grandmother's ashes into the sugar cookies that we ate today and then it got to a parent to panic been called the ... I I Wonder if they have not yet tasted are tested the sugar cookies\nWe don't know that this is true of course if it is true that brings up a whole lot of other issues who would do this\nHappy Halloween who would put a family member in a cookie their ashes in a cookie and it's so disgusting how a case for the prank oh ah well like this if you bake the cookies in the ashes and so I don't know ... you probably wouldn't taste it and then we got like asking your mouth and you're walking around after a fire yeah ... yeah\nThat's what I was thinking that I guess if the cookies had a lot of sugar and maybe some chocolate or whatever in there with overwhelming guys like oh my God oh can you imagine okay you think that he gave you cookies and you ate it this is delicious and you find out somebody's grandmother\nRashes one of the you know I I Wonder if the gonna bring in counselors and all that stuff if they find out this is true I mean if this is true I kinda doubt it's true just because of the nature of this is weird although and they're also claiming that a couple of students did this well so a couple of students they both had the grandmothers ashes at home so we're in an iron\n[laughter] you don't be funny we picked the ashes into the cookies and brought them into school and they get a nursery school may take them wouldn't that be great\nI said I Hope this is fake I truly\nSee if we find out in the coming days so this is in Davis, California the police are looking at it and I maybe they don't have any of the sugar cookies to test maybe that's the problem there wasn't any leftover evidence to test because I think they would have done that by now you have to just to follow up on these reports before it becomes a media story by\nComing up next what happens when squatters\nTake over your home and a lot of scammers out there that people realized that are homeless for rent and right now nobody's living there they might take to a place like Craig's list and
