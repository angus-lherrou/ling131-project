I never know how normal people react to stuff like that you know I don't I you know I have a ... I listen to no political advertising I mean I hardly\nHardly watch any news anymore because it's just a a fulfill old Amish their phones are being down my theory wants to know what you want to Syria never works when I Want it um\nWas talking about you're talking how your two out you don't know why don't we don't know I don't have regular people saying that to me if I saw some kind of suspicious unfamiliar proposition TV ad\nI'd immediately look it up and say well wonder what that is but it would be in the context that oil is that something good for the show I don't know normal people who don't have radio shows doesn't just blow by them or do they say well what is that do they what because then once you look and realize its prop Sixers repealing the gas tax most people go oh yeah you don't want to repeal the gas that right\nWell that's what I'm thinking I think it's finally happening or the relic with the el Segundo times George Skelton wrote about this but I think he's like a week at a date\nAnd he's saying it is in trouble because people don't know about it they don't know what it is they don't live inside this political bubble where the coverage has been heavy on all this nonsense by the pundits about well I Want to get Republican votes even if people don't pay attention to that and my impression\nIs been this is an ... everyone thinks every question as possible and no matter how many times pollsters get things wrong or you find out there's question abused where they they ... the question people still want to believe in polls right well here's something they automatic believe it and I'm thinking well\nCould could you could you get that pollster question and be against the idea of blowing up bridges and still say oh but I'm voting against the gas tax repeal like maybe they think it's different questions I asked extra appeal when there's something else that blows up the bridges write something ... about highway safety because I asked somebody\nI don't maybe was ... trying to think alas I said it's not really any way to pull this question and he says I'll probably there isn't because you don't know what's in people's heads men just by setting it up you skew the question if you set it up to say hey this question\nProp sixes about gas ... boom right away you get a completely different result if you just let it lay there with that with that bad generic bridges are going to collapse language all I don't want that to happen\nWell the balance summary actually says reduces roads and transportation funding and that is throwing some people off they do not understand the gas in the car tax repeal when they do they're much more in favor it's been like that since the beginning it's just that the poll takers some of them\nBecause we had one last week to survey usa in a TV station in San Diego and we've got a hold of it and they actually directly ask people do you want to repeal last year's gas tax and was it was like fifty eight percent yes\nYeah yeah see that's just what we've been saying All right well we're going to find out\nThat this will be a good test when Paul posters are asking the right question somebody's asking the wrong question well\nSome of them feel like they're they're purists they have to ask what's that but if if others say we have to ask what the what the ballot really what the proposition ... say that but that if it results in bad information now you end up you know with everyone climbing Hillary Clinton can be president\nRight so join us Wednesday and active auto body details on the website more

publicity 'cause I remember feeling surprise they were coming on and then I realize now they just want the publicity\nIt's a media gained you're trying to deceive media into thinking that something is really popular so what would you do well if you don't have a lot of support for whatever\nYou know campaigning got going on why don't you call crowds on demand they'll send them there they'll dress them up they'll carry signs they'll yell and scream for yeah why not these are and the media will cover like the dumb jerks they are oh you look at this there's a lot of people angry with these policies\nOut of work actors is who they hire for this there's thousands of them with nothing to do so they get a date rape to perform as protesters this is no different than being extras on a movie set where they're having a protest sea\nSo crowds on demand is of Beverly Hills from that does higher protestors on the website it provides clients with protests rallies flash mobs paparazzi events another inventive PR stunts we provide everything\nIncluding the people the materials and even the ideas\nI think this was the company we talked about where if you want to give your ah your girlfriend

download the proposition podcast of course and Carl okay if I knew\nUm but it's been real difficult to try to address the issue well why are also addressing\nGo ahead why don't they get a license rather than a surrendering\nWell those that ... and and that's a good point a good question good point\nSo those that are properly license through the state that are providing treatment and they're following all the regulations and they're doing everything by the book were not touching those and we can't touch those protected by state law but if they're operating illegally or they're not following the rules of the of the state license or whatever it is\nUm or if they don't have a license at all and then they're providing services at home or going after them because they're required to have a license\nI'm so I'm you know the reason that they operate outside of the state requirements and and following the rules is because there's more profit and doing so and so you have a lot of the illegal businesses are trying to operate off the grid\nThey pretend that there are legitimate but they're really not legitimate because they have followed all the rules and gotten license\nAnd they're packing homes with twelve to Fifteen to twenty people\nAnd their billing insurance and that's another thing that we're doing what the DA court mating our efforts because our da Tony ... Koch is wants to go after them for insurance fraud and everything else so it's a real for for a lot of these illegal businesses it's a real racket it's a real problem and I can tell you\nThey don't care about their um their folks because if insurance dries up for the money dries up they're kicking them out on the street they're adding to our homeless population just like Ken indicated on the introduction here\nSo it's a real issue a real problem on multiple fronts\nUm and so we're we're frankly just thrilled that the Tony ... Koch is has agreed to work with us we're the first city in the entire county to be going after these illegal businesses in this way so it's pretty novel and I think it's going to be extremely effective and we're sending a message to the entire industry you know if you're going to come to Huntington Beach into business you better do it\nI'm above monster and according to state law or you're going to be in the crosshairs there\nThere's a list and one of the news stories the names of these companies and the principal officers these companies have you talked to these people directly for job well a lot of paperwork and they they uh that was enough to chase down\nNow that we haven't I haven't seen that list you're looking at but we have spoken to a few of them of course um and we do have um our code for officers and our police have reports incident report so we have a whole host of documentation plus labor complaints and things of that nature\nWhere I'm saying is they did they try to say no we're totally justified you're\nSolo that you talk to her attorney or do they just say okay we're we're getting out of here you got it\nOh I see what you're saying no they're they're they're folding and going because they know they know they got caught so and\nLike I said you know it's a real there's a real clean delineation if you are a proper facility providing treatment you're licensed by the state and you're doing everything about the board here fine and you know what let me tell you those operators that are good\nThat I follow the law and they do everything that's we're supposed to do their good neighbors none of our neighborhoods are complaining about them they're doing everything right there actually good neighbors it's the ones where we have\nDeath we have overdoses we have fights we have a lot of police calls they're packing houses they're turning those weren't paying out on the street those are the ones those are not those are the ones that are just not they're not legal or illegal businesses they're not licensed properly and are not providing a good service to their patrons\nAll right thanks for talking with Michael gates we appreciate it keep us updated absolutely anytime they can't\nUse the attorney for the city of Huntington Beach and he teamed up with Orange County and they're going after some of these sober living homes and the ones you mentioned I'm sure\nThere are the biggest violators I mean these are sober living homes in a residential neighborhoods that are really disrupting and uh that was the key point that interview where he said a lot of them are just they're just holding up there just All right you got a\nMinute come after all these fines in profits ... who is on this or we got more coming up if you are looking to win some money listen\nYour shot at one thousand dollars now explanation why keyword bills to two hundred two hundred and get a sex confirming injury plus I have a radio invoke standard data resupply in this nation wide ... that some bills to two hundred two hundred\nAnswered the phone even if it's from a number you don't recognize next chance to win next hour between five oh five five twenty and you can win a thousand dollars once an hour Monday through friday from five to six twenty Deborah mark as news\nDo Lakers have been suspended for a despite the Houston Rockets to guard ...

Laura Riley\nNow the reason that Tony is coming on Todd Spencer says that the many months before these two were taken into custody there was a search warrant that would've allowed them to execute the search warrant and find drugs and guns and money and that may have been enough\nTo take them into custody looks like even back in January that's Todd Spitzer's claim\nAnd we're going to hear what Tony ... says a response to that because Todd saying that this was reckless and these two were able to stay out there in the public and do what they've been doing for months months months on end until they were finally taken into custody more recently\nSo 'cause there's even a judge the judge in the case was even asking the same types of questions\nWhich we'll talk about with Tony ... caucus after the news at five o'clock a judge had signed off on the search warrant in January you said in court that prosecutors feared the two were such a risk to the public they should have been arrested in January\nAnd he said why wasn't this case fast\nTracked underestimate earlier because if you got the drugs and the guns that you have the case against them for the sex\nAssault probably have something right but you could put them away and then you wouldn't have had any victims since January right anyway drugs and the guns David Jones Orange County superior court judge Greg Jones did ask this question\nIn court so we'll talk about it with Tony are the ah Los Angeles county fire department you know how much this costs taxpayers in LA county one billion dollars a year and that's not the payroll just for payroll a billion dollars a role\nWe do have ten million people living in this county and it's very very ... y geographic range\nBut and I got to say you and I covered the fires for a long time here and we've noticed in LA county they\nDo a pretty good job getting right on top of things sort of but yeah for the wire July already I go which didn't have any firefighters in orange county would seem slow sometimes but now that there's there's a lot of intense work that goes on during fire season\nAnd and some years or ... ... no no no no no no no no what climate change says there is no fire season anymore it's all year round which is weird because remember the outburst we hadn't July with the fires here we are this is like supposed to be the worst month October it's been pretty quiet\nYeah because all their predictions are all we have our sites All right Mike in fact as soon as they announced that we're going to have fires all year I knew wildfires are going to stop [laughter] and then we're going to fall they did and I shouldn't say tomorrow could bring something different it was something that hasn't been a bad month or do you know there were sent in his last week right there were\nBut that has not as hot though we had a contributed was really low humidity was like oh headache are causing so uh\nThe uh Los Angeles el Segundo times has story out\nOn overtime pay and the LA county fire department more than six hundred and forty fire department workers received at least a hundred thousand dollars just in overtime in twenty Seventeen now there are a hundred thousand employees wow\nBut it it's a hundred thousand police of the only county fire wow I it just seems amazing to me\nMore than six hundred and forty of 'em received at least a hundred thousand dollars in overtime and the twenty Seventeen calendar year and the comparison they made was severely county sheriff's department with a number was only twenty eight and they've twice the number of workers\nOh that's a big difference\nSo according to this analysis fire department employees represent about a third of the counties one thousand highest paid employees\nJoined the ranks of surgeons anesthesiologist and pediatricians who work in the public hospitals now you can make an argument that surgeons anesthesiologists and pediatricians are very specifically highly trained workers that you know sometimes do become Hi Tate right that's the way it is a private ... doctors they have doctorates yeah\nAmong county workers who owned earned overtime fire department employees received the most on average by a wide margin they were paid about forty nine thousand dollars each in overtime last year well workers and other agencies including the sheriff's department repeat about eighty two hundred\nOvertime accounted for about a third of the average fire department employees annual pay last year for other departments it's only about six percent so you can see this is way out of whack in fact they talked to a senior research assistant at UC Berkeley who said somebody not doing who scheduling\nCorrectly there yes you have too much overtime that now you know at at at the height of a crazy wildfire obviously it's gonna be all hands on deck maybe for an extended period\nBut that's what they're claiming it in a particularly if off I guess twenty Seventeen was a tough year with a lot of fire is kind of thing but I Do is a hundred thousand employees for the whole county oh you're right on it yeah oh no wonder I saw that I thought that you are in an apartment now so I'm just having for the whole county but um\nIt [noise]\nKnow I I I I I have a hard time believing when you have six hundred and forty people getting a hundred granted overtime that that's a good cover story
