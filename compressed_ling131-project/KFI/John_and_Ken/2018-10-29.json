{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "I can totally see doing that um there is a a there is a story I'm Out of the University of South Carolina and when I first saw the headline that said USC and I thought oh boy\nUh but I thought that sounds about right well University of South Carolina so many drunk game Cox are being transported to the emergency room during the home football games the stretchers line\nThe hallways of Paul metal health Baptist hospital\nIt has completely strained all ER services are there that these kids are drunk and so they're disorderly\nSlowing down nurses who are there to take care of the truly sick one nurse at palmetto health Baptist saying that these kids are drunk they trying to run away they try to bite people they pie in the corner\nMhm mhm [noise]\nIn the shadow of Williams Bryce stadium on Saturday when the game Cox took on the Tennessee Volunteers hundreds of women lined the wood fence with a\nGate that said female entrance only and behind that spans were a bunch of people pre gaming too in in\nHugging each other stumbling around spilling red Keller beverage from a red cup\nYou've ever done that you ever wonder you don't look at me like that I'm asking a question of mine\nThat's that's that's\nShe goes state right there bottle away I was on their child to about eighty jungle juice but they didn't have a football team when you were there did they know that didn't need a game to do that just pretend like there was a [laughter] a bottle\nOf whisky on the ground a few feet from them boots high heels in sandals trampled other solo cups abandoned beer cans and emptied six pack holders\nAnd they are admitting that this strain has become\nA not comical anymore right\nEspecially when if something were to happen and and they actually needed a these nurses and medical texted to pay attention to people who are legit sick and\nYou get an influx of a drunk college kids they say that they see a spike in a drunk USC students during Halloween is well the first week of school some of the holidays and one of the nurses says listen I'm most of them are Eighteen Nineteen years old\nAnd I'm sure they are pretty sure the drinking age in South Carolina's Twenty one\nLast year a hundred and sixty one students were transported to the hospital for alcohol or drug related reasons about five per week and a lot\nWell and that's just a partial count because um the university isn't necessarily notified when a student is transported to the hospital from somewhere off campus ... those are just on campus students that were then taken to the hospital\nBetween October second sixteens the University of South Carolina police department cited eleven people for underage drinking and in every case emergency medical services had to be called in every\nSingle case one of those students was taken to jail because he was resisting EMS treatment but the rest I had to be taken to the hospital as well because they were that\nHammer and listen to this delight St Patrick's Day twenty three year old student flailing around and allegedly\nBit the tar out of one of the nurses will Korea and South Carolina that's what they were before she was put in restraints woman arrested taken to jail she was charged with third degree assault and battery released on a thousand dollar a thousand dollar bond that cases on going\nTo tell you women at football games Scott and crazy at the chargers raiders game ... they were all raiders fans ... all the ... fights and both fights\nWere between two females to female raiders fans not even the opposing team and I mean I'm watching this thing from the field\nAnd you know how the seats are it step up there right there right there right on top of the field so I I like uh for a first row view to this thing and these two women are throwing punches they're pulling hair there's big ass man getting between the two late and and they act like nothing happened\nI mean they act like there's no one there they're throwing people aside just that that anger I mean what do you see it and it it just [noise]\nI understand that I'm One of these people right when you have any woman and somebody in the stands dreaming at a football game with that angry luck is not a good luck it is\nTerrifying so what have you learned about I've learned not to be that guy or girl I guess in this case where you that girl last night at the game\nNo no I did yell down one Boston Red Sox woman who was that fan\nBut you were not her\n... it was you were just tired I didn't yell and anger I kind of gave up on this World Series in game two and the fifth inning\nAnd kind of didn't see it coming together um veto it wasn't really a shocker\nNurses EMTs other first responders there in and around University of South Carolina uh say that they are concerned more over the police practice\nBecause police are bringing these drunk students to the hospital when they don't even need medical care they just need to go home and sleep it off yeah now granted I Would rather have a nurse or doctor make that determination than a police officer the police officers got other stuff to do\nThey don't need to determine whether that's a you know Suzy or Johnny needs to go to the hospital for alcohol poisoning let the doctors do that\nBut they're talking about a\nOfficers from the U. S. C. police department and the Columbia police department will catch under age students drinking and give them the option of going either to jail or to the hospital now what would you choose if you were Nineteen years old and ... in our questions yeah yeah\nSo that makes perfect sense they said that they wouldn't want to change that they want to make sure that this policy whether it's written or not\nThis policy changes for students who do need to be in the emergency room they'll be in there with the blood alcohol level of a point to for a point three point for his death\nPretty much yeah so point three you're you're getting up there pretty good then obviously in South Carolina like just about everywhere else in the country point oh wait is a is considered too drunk legally drunk when it comes to driving\nSo that's a Seventy percent well the\nOther statistics about drinking at the University of South Carolina but the that being said the hospitalist tax because the drunk students that use USC that's fantastic\nCould you imagine if you were in the ER with a legit problem and some jackass comes in and he and in the corner\nSome some frat yeah dumb sorority girls chewing on your nurse [laughter]\nJohn how are you good to Troy last night uh [laughter] I remember last night crap game huh it was a complete crap\n[noise] told me how many Red Sox fans were there I did I was pretty old were you there last\nNight I Know but I mean just watching the post game when they were when they were like ... be network set up their stay out there on the right field line down the first one they're worth thousands of people either on the field or in the stands\nOn the the uh the the field level seats behind first ... a sea of red yeah Dodger fans all flooded about beef in it and I saw an endless stream of red lights in the parking lot beyond and then we were sitting up in the next level\nAnd we were we were in total Red Sox territory at and we walked out into the concourse to leave and\nAll the red Sox fans are milling about and sharing and twice I heard people say wow this is just like Fenway [laughter] it was ... he ended up that it's fifty degrees warmer here than it would have been found out they they like like a warm version of February that route I Would travel issue if that was my I you know I think there's also\nA lot of transplants here too sure that came out and I think the Dodger fans were selling on ... their tickets by the thousands to the red Sox fans nobody want her to watch the the final wipe out\nDid you ever find some shared ne ... okay you know [laughter]\nI don't know how your\nThat high up and how you fenced yard me up there she's got mad and sent me a photo over shards me [laughter] I just I just want to do that at every once in a while [laughter] I wasn't going to disappear for three innings at my wife go where were you looking for a glass of wine\n[laughter]\nYou are and what are you guys have coming up to a coming up after two thirty\nOf the uh the uh leave promoters a prop sex the gas tax repeal are declaring war on the attorney general and we're going to explain them major legal announcement today I'm them\nGreat John and can show coming up we'll see you tomorrow they drive your body\n[noise]\nAnd a little tiny [noise] theory\nAnd Janet hey pacify Angela in orange county and I are ready\nFor homeless housing I'm Deborah Martin live on the KFI twenty four hour News Rome a federal judge says he wants to take back the beaches and parks from homeless people in orange county\nBut that's only possible by providing new shelter space officials in Santa Ana said they'll have a new shelter with two hundred beds ready to go with a couple of days Anaheim says a shelter with another two hundred beds will be ready and December Orange County supervisor Todd Spencer says the judge's trying to allow police to enforce anti camping laws\nHe does not want to take away law enforcement's right to arrest people who are not taking care of themselves\nSo officials say an ongoing lawsuit over space for the homeless is near a settlement in Santa Ana Andrew ...

rainbows or the show before us oh that show yeah uh anyway uh ... and ... and you didn't help the Dodgers last night 'cause you were in the crowd where they lost the last game he said it was full of Red Sox and oh the places right I heard you speculate I think you're right\nAfter they lost game four and they're down three to one a lot of Dodger fans who were planning on going to game five change their mind\nUnloaded their tickets and then Red Sox people wherever they are whoever they are picked him up but we were I was monitoring the ticket price so you were talking about game five lead along huh yeah right 'cause Sunday that it was like oh the first day like I'd like a week ago you were like ...\nWell yeah because the ticket the tickets really high and then they dropped in half as we got closer but it's Saturday Night was a was game for right and that was the game that the Dodgers really blew\nThey were up for nothing in the seventh and eighth of that was a stunner when they were up for nothing I thought All right the prices are probably going to shoot up for game five cause that's going to be two two and there'll be a lot of interest so I'll buy now soon as I buy right and prices had already gone up so\nAs soon as I buy that's when the red Sox came back and they one night six and then the prices cratered so I thought I was buying at the bottom but I didn't buy it's about oh you should have waited right and it turned out thousands of Los Angeles fans ditch the Dodgers you idiot\nAnd sold their tickets on stuff oh you don't want to go when they lose that last game and nobody wants to see the other team celebrate on the no I mean last year was different they got the game seven you went to a game six last year game six Shiite okay so it was probably a bit of a price break because they were down three to two and maybe some people thought that this could be a tonight\nRight everybody goes to a game seven yeah I don't know what's going to happen but did you stay in lots of Red Sox celebrate did you leave\nNo I I stayed much you did watch the whole ceremony wondered about that because I was watching the end of it last night I thought well John Still sitting there watching about the red Sox game the championship trophy my son's really into the red Sox one of them moved to Boston for four years so they wanted to stay oh I didn't realize and yeah the other one the other one of your sons had to leave early though\nI he stayed a pretty long he did he did there was some debate in your family about somebody wanting to having to leave and I yeah I Know now and say you can't do that is a World Series you got hooked into the game so so um you stay pretty late\nBut in any event the place the place that emptied out like in the eighth inning\nIs nobody did was five to one if I Want it in the Dodgers looked so dead I mean just so dead and so the Dodger fans streamed out and then you know a fewer left but then they ran out of there after the final pitch\nAnd now you I there were still a lot of the crowd left and it was all read in the field level seats behind the first base dug out lots of red enthusiastic crazy to in fact the section we're in we're above that and it it was as loud for the red Sox as if as if you were in uh in Boston\nSo we watch the whole you know the whole post game ceremony went into the concourse to leave\nAll Red Sox fans around they're chanting there screaming and yelling and twice I overheard a guy going wow this is just like Fenway wow this is just like fed by running away when I was a ... game where\nYou know there were seven an old ... do you do you expect the place to be\nThis was a team that's special and that's been the least Seventy five thousand people half of them were Packer fans and it was kind of\nI don't know I was disillusioned sitting there just hearing them screaming yelling go pack go like really but I realize LA's gotta lotta transplant and the Packers had not been hearing many years to play the Los Angeles ramps and its Aaron Rodgers I get all that but I still did not expect is a\nLoud Kareem pulled him like I said just one of my friends or\nHow many people's lives in Wisconsin on ever lived in Wisconsin that could be here today they're all the gear\nIt can't be there's many fans of the other team which is kind of experience every week you go to the other teams hands on the east coast even if your team's losing the world series I don't think in in in Boston Red Sox fans fleet\nThe way they are on your old outside of LA against the Tampa does when it comes to sports there people are very uh you know they're only going inch deep three mile wide spread and it's with a rash deep they leave their something better to do\nRight so if it's bad things happen they're out of there you know they they they can't they can't sit and watch bad news though and if their hometown team is there real that's where they are legion\nSays but you know before the game and she walking by and I just have a polo shirt with rams on it yeah they do get in your face go pick up we're going to beat you even I said you know what am I going to be like after the game I thought about doing [laughter]\nOn their face is going to go see the Green Bay Packer fans were rush out and it you know they're all they're all they do they were simple together just to go back go yeah he ran beat LA and I'm like wow ... ...\nPeople are so sad I Know they are\nAnd of course there will drink it was a woman behind me I thought she was overdosed I couldn't believe it she was passed on I kept thinking this woman ... she was watching any of the games just sit there and her seat like a zombie and I told her she vomited on me that's it [laughter]\nLet me stop going to

be held accountable\nIs it five thousand armed soldiers are adding to the border the fine print is but they can't actually enforce the laws along the border\nNo that that's what this looks like which is about a second caravan is there any truth to this er yeah\nThere is still the first one that was hit seven thousand is now down according to the Pentagon to thirty five hundred this afternoon\nThere the numbers have gone way down and there's still a thousand miles away from Texas and Texas is a lot closer than California when it comes to to marching through Mexico California going to Tijuana and what the last ... months ago\nThat was almost double the distance so most to go and make a right hand turn I and they go in to try to go into make Allen, Texas\nNobody knows where the the first caravans going to go there is a caravan behind them that they believe is about two to three thousand people as well\nUh and so according to the White House and the Pentagon and department of homeland security they see in preparation for those two caravans arriving in the U.S [laughter]\nBut they're a long way away being that they're walking in the in the first one is a thousand miles away at most they've done about twenty five miles a day they've taken a lot of days off because there are a lot of children in with them that they just can't do twenty five miles a day a marathon today\nThat uh it's going to be a while but\nToday we're rushing troops to them\nUs border and you could say that the Pentagon says or does getting ramped up and ready for whoever's going to arrive the the critics of it are saying well it's to ramp up and get ready before election day so that headline can go out there\nYeah that that's a reasonable conclusion if they're not going to be here for a couple of months and we're doing a surge at the border now and then all those soldiers can't do very much anyway then that's a but that's good that that's a good for his election jammed and they literally walking most of them\nYeah and I mean they every once in a while they hop on the back of trucks or or get on a train but for the most part they've been walking and that's why it takes so long I mean it's probably going to be a week at this point before they get to the U.S or\nAre they all they're all they're all going to cross let's say the first candidate and he said there's maybe thirty five hundred left are they all going to try to cross\nAt the same site at the same time in Texas\nWe have no clue and nobody knows even the caravan members don't know we've got teams who have been with the caravan and they don't know if they're going to California where they're going to Arizona New Mexico or tax if they don't know if they're going to break up\nAnd remember the last caravan was several thousand strong and then when they got to Tijuana and try to get into San Diego there were about a hundred and fifty people left this one in a matter of days has gone from seven thousand down to thirty five hundred it's a long trip and it's a lot of families and a lot of them just don't make it plus\nMexico has been offering asylum in Mexico to keep them from continuing on to the u._s. which the Pentagon today thank Mexico said Mexico has been a great partner in this offering different conditions that offers to those who are making their way through the country to try to stop them from going north\nWe don't know what the numbers are going to be nobody knows\nAnd those who are marching say that they're going to do with the previous caravans have done and they don't plan on trying to race across the border they don't have pitchforks and you know and and tiki torches and try to come across\nThat they plan to stop and and seek asylum which is what the last group did in the water they got to the border I mean a border crossing fed we don't have room for you you're going to have to wait and they waited for days on the Mexico side until they could walk in\nAnd calmly make a claim for asylum and many of them with children or with a husband or wife I and then they began the process from there and no indication you always have a couple of bad apples last through bad\nHalf a dozen of the the younger folks who didn't have families with I'm trying to jump the defense and they got apprehended they think they got everybody that will probably happen here again but the the larger group says that they're going for asylum\nPart Alex thinks that report you got that\nMuch don't ABC News we can't find out the caravan little bit more on that including the secretary of homeland security Houston new and seeing the Caribbean not getting into the U.S we got that audio and more coming up\nYour chance to win a thousand dollars this year\n[noise] your sided one thousand
