with this idea Frank welcome back\nKen it's great to be back especially as a waiter yes tell us about it oh it's great and thank\nYou and thanks for having to get back on and John as well uh I her radio\nOr it was a unanimous vote last night by the city and city council and I want to I Want to thank the ... and the city council members and there were four council members who are really instrumental in helping us a navigate this but it was unanimous and\nThey're removing the road diet from the I guess you know basically it's called the capital improvement project basically it's removed from the books for orange grove\nBut there's also other road diets planned in Pasadena\nAnd people are asking yeah yeah so we want your help the emails will not stop coming it absolutely\nYeah no I I think people get word that you guys were successful what was the deciding factor for the city council decided to shelve this\nYou know it's kind of interesting and it there's a couple of things first of all a city manager did a great job of putting together summarizing basically the project was an funded and most of the money was supposed to come from SP one basically our state tax dollars no less and\nLess of one percent of the people who commute and there's really not that many commuter cyclist again make that distinction right everybody's recreational cyclist alright ends which is great\nBut it ... and it was also a one of the supporters said it was the dog that approach a K pm that we won through data we one through accuracy we provided the facts we want it to where we were working with the DOT department of transportation\nAnd I think talking with the city council members and and having a very honest discussion there even themselves are going to be impacted by this road diet and I\nAnd that's basically what it is um [noise] ... you know peel back layers and understand what the true decisions were but I think I think though can and to everybody listening I think that the key message into walk away\nIs that the mayor said rightfully so that this is a great opportunity for us to work for citizens are neighborhoods to work better with their departments and two city council is specifically in Pasadena\nSo um there's a lot probably going to be some robust discussion on how they do better outreach to instead of doing these things possibly in a vacuum or when they do community reach out it's almost I don't know I I don't want to say this but it's manufactured by cycle activists who who do this\nBlast yes we will yeah All right and if you want to find out more

go to our website do they get involved sign up to volunteer gets signed them and make sure this doesn't happen to this day this thing could get a lot worse with this guy\nThe last time I heard him address the homeless and she was a couple of months ago and he made some perplexing comments one I don't know if you saw it John Cox is my guest the running for governor against Gavin Newsom he said let's put them all on federal disability did you read that like I just [laughter]\nWell the fact is they're all of a lot of them already are which is another a disgrace because if the money's going to waste I mean\nYou know a lot of these people and not clean and sober and so what are they using the money for you can just you can just imagine a that's why we have to get creative with solutions we have to get public private partnerships\nSt john's home in Sacramento is a model father Joe's villages in San Diego as a model these aren't just missions are rescue places where people just a flop\nThese are places where people can transition where they actually get clean and sober they actually get training and and that's that's the only\nThing they have there and they have to want to go right that's been the problem there's this hard core homeless population that does not want anything to do with treatment or help they liked living on the streets and they're so addicted to their minds\nBut we we can't allow them to do that you know I mean you you cannot let people occupy our streets in our parks or it's\nIt's a health hazard it's ruining the situation for everybody else are we pride ourselves on tourism and the state it's a major part of our economy convention business\nIt's going to have an effect on that it's going to affect human health we have a state of forty million people we can't let hype is take cold and\nYou know and really you know hurt us ah this is gonna be a we've got to get it done\nThe mayor of San Francisco now is London Breed and she said recently\nNot dealing with all the homeless but she said we actually need to get conservative shipped over some of these people because she identified like two hundred I'm In San Francisco believe me that's a low number but she said we do need to take over because they cannot make decisions for themselves I mean doesn't that described a lot of what you saw yesterday\nNo question and again it takes leadership and uh you know if that's what she's talking about I think that that ... avenue or to take him I'll work with anybody on getting a solution but we we really have to get a solution for this because it's going to affect all of a sudden you\nKnow let's face it you know Gavin Newsom about his watches watched this situation develop but he's he's also watched regular working California for the forgotten California into\nCan't afford a house that can't afford gasoline or you know he's in favor of the gas tax even ... they were trained to know where the uh the slow speed boon dog or a\nYou know if he's going to double income taxes he's going to get rid of prop Thirteen protections that me homelessness is one issue but there's a whole ton of 'em that this guy is on the wrong side of and we got to make sure that we do something different\nYeah you know you probably heard this statistic\nCalifornia's twelve percent of the nation's population we got a quarter of the homeless\nAnd I think it was in one of your press releases hear about that\nHappened on our watch we're responsible for that Democrats have been in charge for many years now in Sacramento while this problem got worse I mean they are the new state is just lopsided there's too many poor people and you know I shouldn't say too many rich people but enough of them to keep California afloat financially but it's very very unbalanced\nOh no question about it and the interest groups in Sacramento want it that way they're the ones that are financing newsrooms wall to wall TV as with which showed his slick smiling face on their while millions of forgotten California's can't afford their own their rent or their gasoline\nAnd you know they're financing those commercials because they want their profit picture to stay the same they want to line their pockets at the expense of hardworking Californians\nAnd those who isn't going to change that status quo he's going to give their interest groups everything that ...

make it on the air with your voicemail largely edited\n... when a fire voice nine that's when he when a five six six or seven eight nine\nI mean it made a mistake last week some guy did a whole song and I thought he only had\nLike ten lyrics in about ... you had to cut it because obviously we can't play a three minute call but he did a prop six or que\n... came in here and said would you know like a headline 'cause she's a news anchor she almost got killed last night was it yeah on my way home from work I Know that's a good inland I fell for it let's see if it's good news or fake news\nOkay well it is not fake news it is real news I was driving home on the freeway was a total nightmare there was a traffic\nThere was an accident and it was it was horrendous and like every other night like every other night but this time there there was an accident so it was worse than usual okay so I have my link or on the good little driver that I Am and I'm going to merge onto the into the fast lane and there's no cars everything's clear\nAll of a sudden a motorcycle zooms in any hits my car oh wow okay so\nI'm thinking oh my gosh how what am I going to do I'm not going to get out of my car in the fast lane\nSo he's splitting lanes always in the left lane\nHe was splitting lanes and I so then you think it was going too fast so but he hit me and he kept going so I was told to him and I rolled down my window I said to me\nAnd he goes no s word and he said I have the right away [laughter]\nAnd he says I said no that's worse [laughter] what did he damage your car okay so I wasn't going to get out so I said I mean we didn't get to the murdered part oh\nAnd I said to me he goes all over this really creepy guy oh you do if he starts ... okay a\nCrime was had to say I don't know if he had tattoos okay he was a very scary\nGuy I and that's all I'm going to say with a an angry voice and he just goes over and I and then he starts zooming across all these lanes of the freeway and ah I'm I was on the phone with my husband I said\nThere's no way I'm going to follow that guy okay no way and so I just I sat there for a second and I and I'm thinking well what am I going to do\nSo I didn't do anything I get home there's no damage my car's totally fine you know what I think happened can well I think he bangs my car with his hands really really high us monitor me up the way because he knew there was no damage it was going to be a hit and run if he because he was leaving I caught up\nIn ... because he thought you cut them off yes which I did in your story as he was going so fast you couldn't pick 'em up coming there trying to say there's probably too\nI've I got punched a couple of times and you know I've looked this up the rule is they're not supposed to go more than ten miles per hour faster than traffic is going so if you're changing lanes I don't know what you were doing sixty do no\nNo it was less than sixty because it was terrible traffic oh they I I don't know thirty\nAll right so she should not have been going more than forty miles an hour as he is he was bleeding lanes and going past you and he told me he would have the right away oh he ... he he does well\n[laughter] my husband heard it on this\nIn the sense that if he's going slow enough you kind of does because he is part of like a traffic lane between lanes you kind of does but if you're going too fast\nThat didn't screw him because a lot of them do they do that lean splitting way too fast and you have to be careful when you're looking at blind spot looking over your shoulder that those guys aren't coming I almost ... one last week\nI changed lanes and then he just goes right past me as funny you mentioned because yesterday I was getting on a freeway there was one of those merge lane Detroit emerging yeah with another lane\nAnd I was moving not fast at all 'cause traffic wasn't moving fast and I saw the motorcycle behind me but I couldn't tell she was going to stay in lane or try to split lanes but you shouldn't split the merge lane that's bad news but I think he tried to do that and he felt I think he felt like I cut them off because he drove up next to me\nAnd ... something look right at me and I couldn't lip read out my windows up on the radio on and it wasn't that interested he didn't give me the finger and then he gave me a little salute a salute to and I thought well maybe I did something right but his face showed angers I couldn't figure out what was going actually was this was a thumbs up\nThat's weird I don't usually they give you a thumbs up when you do the kind thing yes and a lot some cyclists do I've had the lengths weather's right move over a little bit for them to give you the thumbs up which is fine I don't care if I get the thumbs up or I don't but I couldn't tell us guys face was angry but he gave me a thumbs up and I think he felt like I wasn't giving him enough of the merge lane he was behind me though\nAnd you have to wait until we merging into your lien splitting 'cause you could split the merge lane that's really dangerous because we're two cars at once we're trying to get into that lane ask brutal\nYeah I that's what I said but I wanted to know why did he want me to get off the freeway how am I going to get out of the feeling that I'm Serious I think he was going to kill me he was going to make them even shorter yes dismembered exactly that's how I almost died last night\nThat's scary it's a good thing and he just ended up going away right\nI he I think he got off the freeway I watched him he was going in between all these different lanes to get off and I just kept going at it there's no way I'm getting the office for\nYou just keep going I don't think of I didn't care what kind of damage I had\nA ton of partners strategies want with optimist has their weekly pulling out in the state wide certainly they're doing a voters will talk about ... six specifically with John Thomas coming up Johnny can't show hey if I Am six forty remark which alive as a news now\nThink about all the way you could send a thousand dollars [laughter] I don't think too long to wait twenty minutes okay Beth Hi Angela in orange county already any takers\nThe Republicans say they're supporting a repeal has grown by over twelve percent okay that's a significant move it still Republican support is only at forty four points that ... that's a static I don't know or a public and in this state that would if they understood what crops six was\nThey would not vote yes so that means there's a lot more education and do\nThe other interesting thing is there's an age gap that we're seeing we're strangely ages Eighteen to thirty for over fifty two percent of them are voting yes in favor repeal\nGood because they don't vote anyway [laughter]\nThat's true or ages thirty five to fifty four which is a critical group\nForty four percent uh\nAre voting no two twenty six percent voting yes that's really where are where the word has to be done right if you're if you're you've got to educate those and then eight fifty five plus is split evenly about thirty five yes the thirty three now so it's that it's at age\nThirty five to fifty four but really if you're fighting for repeal you have to be bullied by these numbers\nThe fact is if you guys were cooked you wouldn't know it by now because the advertising would be sticking on the no side and the trend line should be accelerating the on the shores should be decreasing but they're not so that means voters are hesitating\nThey don't quite know what to make of it and it also means that guys like you were breaking through that means that you guys only have to accelerate\nHow loudly you speak and how often you speak about devices\nAnd I I I think you're probably aware joined that reform California\nI went on a blitz there and they made robocalls and they sent out those little mailers it looked like government noticed is that a ballot correction prop Sixers the gas in the car tax repeal I mean we can't underestimate the name had effect and a number of voters who got that in the mailbox and said look you've done your right and the next on somebody like you calls up there like now I understand it is again ... I'm a yes\nRight and and I also think prop six is benefiting from the fact that it's probably the sexiest thing we've got\nGoing on in the eyes right that is yeah and I'm a new bottle is you're just a blonde measures dominate did most of the ballot propositions and the the gas tax repeal is at least interesting and yet sexy as you put it that question\nWhen you talk to people this large blocked it I'm sure you get any fuel for why\n[noise] they just haven't dialed in you know most voters are aren't going to really dial and until the week before the election so so that's why I think it's they just really haven't focused and there's no career they have no career direction on which way they go and that's a good news if you're fighting for repeal that means that they haven't\nBeen ... buying the advertising of the no side so if you're the no side you have to you basically have to say we've had our switch up our ad creative because whatever worse were ah were pitching their not purchasing to date um so\nIt's it's ... next week we're we're very very telling or what are our tracking survey shows is the yes starts to overtake 'cause I Know side getting to that forty percent that means you guys are doing is is breaking through and voters just aren't going to buy with the no side of selling\nAll right John ... thanks for talking to me again\nThanks guys or Thomas partners strategies along with optimist KFI an NBC for this week's six of their California state wide poll up proposition six gas tax repeal is thirty five percent yes thirty five point seven percent you know\nWhen a big chunk twenty nine point to ensure yet how they're going to vote on prop six keep working on those people you must know them remember this we don't know who's actually going to vote either Malian or on election day November ...\nWhen people are polls they'll say oh I'm a registered voter ensure asked me the questions but do they bother and it's very true often with the younger people are like hey you know you're caught me I'll answer your questions but some election\nDay I don't feel like stopping by the polling place I forgot what the mail in ballot is and they just skip the whole thing minutes\nThe turnout will be atrocious as it normally is so let's get our site out their gas tax repeal dot org is more you can do I'll be talking to ... mile again next hour they're doing this big state wide tour with their pro prop six bus you'll hear more about it there in Pasadena or today Johnny kid showing KFI here's your chance when a thousand dollars\nDealers shot at one thousand dollars now than he can like key word when ... you'll get attacked confirming entry plus I have a radio info standard dead I miss it breaks apply in this nation wide contest that's when it two hundred two hundred\nDo you do not recognize the number you have another chance to win next hour between four oh five and four twenty your chance to win a thousand dollars it's once an hour here on KFI Monday through friday finding um our 'til six twenty PM well let's check on the news is Deborah\nSome trouble near Malibu and we will check in with the chaos find the sky neck\nExit you're timeshare safely legally and forever that's what time share exit team is all about when the resort that you pay good money for fails to live up to expectations that they said\nIf you can't book when and where you want to if the fees keep increasing if your family can no longer afford it if you unexpectedly inherited it and it feels more like a burden that a blessing called timeshare exit team timeshare exit team as offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract and then find\nLeft isn't the only answer I have to lift IQ skin tightening procedure developed by Beverly Hills plastic surgeon that gives you years younger looking skin with no surgery no pain no scarring of anesthesia it only takes one appointment and lift each has a visible results guaranteed I mean who's got that\nCome meet me and learn more about it at one of lift peaks free lunch and learn events versus Saturday October twenty seven to ten o'clock at the Westin hotel in Costa Mesa\nThe other is Sunday the twenty eight at ... at the Ritz Carlton marina del ray calling RSVP now eight hundred nine five zero eight thousand that eight hundred nine five zero eight thousand or go to lift the dot com that to L.

Fridays played back of calls coming up to friday and two days at five twenty and five fifty we were just talking to ABC News reporter Randy field for the latest\nOn the Trump Administration and the you know in a certain way though [laughter]\nThis is the disappearance of a Saudi journalist in the country of turkey\nOr why are we again and I think that's part of what Trump he didn't say that but why are we the center of attention wondering where are you gonna do about it oh we're going to find the murderers what are we going to do to Saudi Arabia like good God really anybody else interested you want to get involved in this British right near the country but French what do you have to say\nAnyway we're going to play some audio of Trump today a because he being accused of not really doing enough to pin this on the Saudis particularly the royal family that runs the country there are reports that some of the suspects those passports\nScans I mentioned they arrived in Turkey probably perhaps the team to kill ... that they have ties to the Saudi crown prince let's listen to Trump talk about all this today\nSecretary of state ... going to be back ah probably late tonight or\nHe went to turkey or [noise] or what do you spend a lot of time with the crown prince and he's got to have a full report [noise] unless given cover all with that being said Saudi Arabia has been a very important ally of ours in the middle east and we are stopping Iran's not trying to stop this stuff and\nWe would have been set for we took away that ridiculous deal was made by the previous administration the Iran deal which\nWas a hundred and fifty million dollars at one point eight million in cash what was that all of that and\nThey are and allies we have a very good allies in the middle east but if you look in Saudi Arabia they're an ally of tremendous purchaser of not only military equipment but other times when I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things as a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military\n[noise] those are the biggest orders and the history of this country probably the history of the world I don't think there's ever been any harder for four hundred and fifty million dollars and you remember that day in Saudi Arabia where that commitment was made so they're an important ally but I Want to find out what happened\nWhere is the fall and we will probably know that by the end of the way for lifetime players coming back from that I Belong to all\nAcross the river\nThe girl was\nWell he wasn't a citizen of this country for one thing and we're going to determine that and you don't know whether or not we have to fly I Know but you know whether or not we've set\nThe beer [laughter] ah I'm not going to tell you [laughter] why would I tell you the audio\nWe asked for it if it exists we have as we've asked for it if it exists prizes they haven't voted\nNo I'm not sure yet that exist probably does possibly the [noise] uh I'll have a full report on that for my when it comes back for that one of the things I got to be\n[noise] so so this president they often accused of rushing to judgment here just wants to see you know the evidence and what's going on with the disappearance of this journalist who apparently because he wrote for the Washington Post did live in Virginia\nAt least some of the time but he has the Saudi citizens he's not a U.S citizen that's what Trump was trying to say that for the audio ... out there I think it went through a Turkish newspaper but that's not clear either I mean we're not in an era of fake news necessarily but\nWe're in an era where everybody wants to get out in front and they sometimes drop whatever source whenever detail they have\nA without a lot necessarily behind it uh I Do I Believe there's audio and video of the death well if it was\nGood I don't know if this video but says audio it could have been recorded yeah some of the guys apple watching maybe after they got his hands off it fell off and somebody found it and turned it over to\nThe Turkish government or Turkish newspaper it's it's not particularly clear but jumped just wants to wait to sort this out and by the way the sides of the oil the arms deal he says is worth a hundred and ten billion dollars\nYep we send a lot of forms to Saudi Arabia is cleaning it's five hundred thousand jobs it's the biggest ordering the history of our country from an outside military and I'm going to turn that down by coming up next we're going to the health and science desk right before that but we'll talk to called the mile\nOr he's going to talk to us today about what they're doing with the yes on six gas tax repeal they're doing a rally in Pasadena where you can stop on by and get

[noise] man when I talked to people they're just ... type\nIs a lot of people had to go to Google it find out what it is not typhoid it's tight first but you know we feel like we are in a third world country this is very bizarre but LA county is experiencing an outbreak of Heifetz was big news last year in the San Diego area was hepatitis\nThis time we blame the fleas but of course some of the outbreaks are focused not all of them in neighborhoods that have homeless people wandering around the LA county board of supervisors took a look at the tight this outbreak let's bring on ... who covered this for can't find it\nHey good afternoon in the county is putting together this plan to try to stop the spread at this point they said there are at least sixty four cases of type is in the county as of this plan involves\nCleaning up homeless encampments you were talking about some of it does involve homeless people a lot of it does and that's really the focus of this plan is to go in and clean up and ... pass out hand sanitizer and offer flee repellent for homeless people who happen to have\nNow when you when you say clear on campus so I mean literally or the going up there to help clean up what they are well surely nothing under the trash pick up some of the trash ... Iraq and the other insects that carry the fleas right and and not least because of food piling up because there's all the food is around to various places that attracts the\nRoad in the wild animals and then the police get on top of them\nUp but this was a measure or emotion by supervisor Catherine Barker and she really had some blunt words in describing the conditions around the county she says really bolts of LA looked like a third country\nWe go out and we provide showers\nAnd they still remains in filthy conditions and are are\nResisting services\nAnd it's putting not only in the homeless on the street at risk it's also putting a residence throughout the county press\nReally this came to the radar of a lot of health officials when eleven people in and around Skid Row suddenly got type is a health officials say people get typists every year and the county but it was that concentrated\nInfection right on Skid Row and homeless and cameras and other homeless people around so that really caught the attention and this is a director of public health Barbara for rare saying that the people homeless people with pets are going to be a focus of this clean up\nSome clinics that clinics in downtown LA to offer for um homeless residents who have pets for them to be able to come in and get sleep treatment for their pets and will continue to do that a throughout the rest of the fall\nAnd they're also asking for donations for fleet colors or to try to\nHelp people who may not have access to one but that really a lot of people with pets especially people who live on the streets that's a real concern is they haven't been able to get a handle of this outbreak should people we're flea collars to don't think that's a good idea no is a boom ward off the fleas like it does for the animals would it would I had a\nI was down on Skid Row yesterday and and when I got home I walked in the door and I noticed I had a flat around me and I may think twice yeah adopted this ride in the car with me the whole way back\nYeah I mean that could very well and then add up this morning and it was really worried you were in Skid Row committed typist fully yeah well I was down to John Cox was humor there while he was ... I oh yeah he said he got to get sprayed down I don't know if that's true or not of it's taken like a flea repellent [laughter]\nI didn't get to see that part of it or I was walking around with them or when he was taking a tour and he looked around and said it was a horrible waste of humanity to be living on the streets in those conditions but I didn't get to see him spray down afterwards\nAlright well it'd be careful those fleecing soon as you for that report\nYou got into a model back from can't find news the only county board of supervisors is going to end up ... and mixed arrest Toombs is part of their strategy to combat the type this outbreak will talk more about twice as you might be surprised what creature what critter\nIs the number one carrier of type ... throughout Southern California and it's not the rat\nWill get into that they're coming up next this will tell you about San Marino man an older man who contract to type and didn't know it in a semi thought he was dying until they got to a better diagnosis it's coming up with a Johnny can't show right now your chance of a thousand dollars\nYou're shot at one thousand dollars now explanation keyword bank to collaborate you'll get a sex confirming entry plus I her radio invoke standard data methods apply in this nation wide contact that bank to two hundred two hundred\nSo into the food even if you do not recognize the number your next chance to win is next hour between five oh five in five twenty you have a chance to win a thousand dollars once an hour Monday through friday here in KFI from five AM to six twenty pm to go to Deborah mark produce something\nNon profit organizations as LA has some of the worst rather than the country nearly sixty percent of the roads in the LA Long Beach in Anaheim areas are considered to be in poor condition ten time Grammy winner ...

P. O. P. O. S. S. you when you see it has a very heavy fleet load\nAnd in this story about the outbreak they believed at least in areas where these creatures are a possum as a major\nContributor to type ... because obviously if it's carrying a lot of fleas and the places that it goes 'cause it's a ... it's looking to feed and it's it'll eat just about anything including of course whatever garbage you leave behind um they are the only North American marsupial\nBut they're very very prevalent in urban communities because they have no living predators and see that and that's the reason that some critters hang around and others don't if you don't have a predator your chances of\nContinuing on the species are pretty good they're typically two feet long and probably you know this from the joke when we were a kid they do have a defense tactic that they can play dead that actually is true\nWhere they can in through a coma like state for up to two hours I used to be joking where can we plant possum yeah you know [laughter] and of course they're nocturnal so there were asleep during the day and they forage for food at night what is the number one cause of death in this country for a possum do you have a guest\nEver mark a hit by a\n... by a car ding ding you win so the question years well why don't we trap them or why don't we try to eradicate the fleas oh this story says one female can lead up to fifty exit hats and to mature adults and just a couple of weeks it would be almost impossible to keep up with the fleet population\nYou know I find them they they they come into my yard and my dog gets fleas and my dog is treated with a flea medication and now I'm I'm figuring this out my dog's probably getting fleece from the fleas that are jumping off the possums", "year": "2018", "show_name": "John and Ken", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "17"}
