satisfaction scores the national average we had sixteen percent fewer um infections than the national average patient care and California is pretty good there's there's always room for improvement and and not every\nPart well we do make this argument and I'm looking at the legislative analysts seeing that on average group an individual health insurance do pay multiple times with government programs

California I think the last time we talked about this in depth\nWas the road diet situation that was going on down in the south bay remember vista del mar in Culver boulevard right in playa del Rey yeah and one of the topics they came up is this idea that what they want to do\nIs bunch isn't the tall buildings right live on top of each other so we can bicycle or hop on a lovely subway and had to work\nThat was the master plan right well you know they built this this expo line in LA is part of the metro system which has got the blue line and the red line runs the ... the newer ones ones from the west side to downtown and by the way I'm getting emails from people over in Santa Monica claim it's bringing the homeless over oh so hopeless expressing\nOff the train that you're in your essay on Saturday at the beach and it's led they leave Skid Row early it's led to a crime wave Santa Monica neighborhood has it be goes bad guys get on the a train they go Rob people in Santa Monica and then they have hot back on the train and get away\nWell they had this density plan\nThe Los Angeles city council adopted an expo lines zoning plan basically what they wanted to do is construct up to six thousand new apartment in Congo units within a half mile above five or five of the metro expo line stations\nAgain as I said the master plan to get people to live on top of each other and within walking distance of mass transit well they already got sued\nGood a group called fix the city\nIs suing the first of the approved expo line density plans because their argument which makes sense David fix the west side what they call over burden Indian adequate infrastructure meaning that the streets\nThe sidewalks are a mess the infrastructure is awful and you want to add six thousand new apartment in Congo unit and it's overwhelmingly jammed with cars\nAnd all these new people moving into these condos are going to be driving you're not\nTo take the ... ... you're not getting on the ... that's the ... what are they going to have their masks senator there they don't walk to work oh no no the master plan is they get big bribes from the developers that's the master plan you wouldn't you wouldn't have to have a job downtown\nIn order to take the expo why most people don't\nDowntown LA only has two percent of the jobs in the metropolitan area in case people don't know it goes a long exposition boulevard basically and uh it stops on its way too cold for a city and other places in between but um that that this garbage the only reason they're they're building these buildings developers are bribing\nCity council people they absolutely make big big bribes and so then they build the buildings and everything's overloaded Ninety five percent of the people moving to these buildings are going to be taking cars and it's going to further\nI I don't you can't fit any more cars I don't know what's gonna happen people aren't gonna be able to back out of their driveways you know white in my neighborhood in fact\nIn ... by the way this is along the Olympic boulevard Venice Boulevard and other major streets between Culver City and sent in LA avenue\nSunset Boulevard is so horribly jam and six o'clock right right and I make a left turn off sunset to go to my house and the left turn I make\nI counted not too long ago eighty eight cars backed up on this side street this normal residential side street eighty eight cars they were trying to make a right turn to get on sunset to go to the four oh five\nIt takes for my house which is roughly a mile from the four or five it can take almost an hour to get to the four oh five\nTo see you see that so they want you out of your car hits the road nobody's out of the car you'll be force no no no no one's out of the car what they what what they what they need to do\nIs they need to bulldoze a big six lane road to the Santa Monica mountains on the west side and create another main a main through way to go from the west side to the valley that's what a rational society would do\nIt says here the plan requires developers to build closer to the sidewalk in place parking behind buildings to create streets that her uniform and inviting the hope is that you will love the ... tree and friendly streets then you will run errands and get to work without getting behind the wheel\nThey're not they're not going to do that they're going to take the car it's too slow\nThey you know it it it it they should stop building anything on the west side I'd be in favor of proposition that completely shuts down all for the development in the west side wrecked capacity\nSaying you have a hotel and you got three hundred rooms\nBut yet five hundred people in the lobby trying to get three hundred rooms at some point you close the front door and say sorry do vacancy go find another hotel the west side is no vacancy didn't know how many more but you ain't seen nothing yet because compared to other large cities we don't have these really huge big apartment buildings that they have like a New York 'cause we're not go you have to build it at the beginning that way\nLew it's too late\nIt's too late there's no way to retroactively make Los Angeles look like New York some possible you have to accept what's here and and they want you are going to be a new not in my neighborhood and ... most of the people in my area or that there are so many\nGroups that are formed to block every single stinking development idea and they filed lawsuits and they go to a\nMeeting about housing crisis what am I going to do with all these not at all when every square inch is built on the way we know that means more capacity means capacity you go go on the five go north on the five there's tons and tons and tons of empty so but he wants to live in Bakersfield it's too bad you were you were too late to the party\nYou sometimes you just too late in life\n... after ... after yeah I thought it was strange coming to shift or you

Orange County and I are radio station United\nOf the fifty five freeway uh so uh that's basically the dividing line for the county except protesting and coast amazed to\nThe other cities have really not come to the table and let me tell you why\nIt's important that they do because if we settled in the north then they're just going to create a bigger problem for their constituents in the south because people will just pack their stuff up and go further south because they know that it's more difficult to enforce the vacancy last\nWell All right and just stand now no city in in in northern Orange County it if they provided the shelter beds can they do the arrest at least you're damn right yeah well the problem goes to the south and let it go to the south and eventually those guys a wake up and come up with their own solution well\nSee I think that's part of the the thought process right that ... that cities will get what they deserve quote unquote because they're not participating but\nBut but look we're talking about public safety public protection I\nDo and not try no one wants to jam any jurisdiction but this is what's gonna happen and I hope you saw this in the LA Times today I'm a there was a really good picture of be walking with judge Carter on the river bed and what what he emphasized in court yesterday was music to my ears which is what I've been saying to you\nSince we cleared the river bed\nWhich is we cannot ever lose the right to arrest\nRight in other words hey ladies and gentlemen who happen to find themselves homeless we want to give you help we want to provide services we want you to go into a shelter but if you don't I'm going to arrest you and I'm going to take your property and I'm going to store it but I'm going to take your property\nAnd I'm going to force you to get into a program and if we lose that well and block like Los Angeles we cannot end up like Los Angeles\nSo when did we go to see this start to play an action please run Orange County I mean I'm curious to see how this plays out now\nWell the judge you know what he said yesterday to the law enforcement who was in his court who I was sitting next to he said I Do not want you a mask elated I don't want you to feel like you're you have lost the right to make an arrest I was glad to hear him say that\nBut I also know that you know he he wants ... step so somebody's breaking the law he wants them to to give them a citation first as opposed to giving them arrest you know that's not going to work I mean\nThese guys will use citations for clean next I mean they you know what's another citation that's that's not appropriate we have to arrest people who refused to go into programs so we can do what so we can get them into what we call collaborative court and we can get them help but you know what there's about twenty five percent\nOf individuals who he won't take help no matter what we do know\nSo well but those those are the guys that had to just move on\nNo no no we move on to my jail\nTo my gym but eventually on to another life and get it together and stop hanging around the streets\nExactly exactly and look the only way we're going to get respect back for the street is if we have enforcement we can never lose the right to enforce and that's what's happening\nIn LA and ultimate ultimately don't you have that right and this went to the U.S Supreme Court wouldn't Supreme Court say that no one has the right to live in a public place\nNo unfortunately John that's no that's not what the court no no and no\nI Wish they were right but that is not that is\nA level of left wing judge in California I'm Talking ultimately national policy there's nothing in the constitution that gives you the right to swat in the street\nThere's nothing that gives you the right to Scott and the street but there is something that says well look I Would love to take this all the way the Supreme Court and\nFight that fight I mean we may end up there but if we don't know the fact is look at the end of the day okay we want to be a humane and compassionate to the best extent we can\nWe talk about the guy who ran they they don't they don't want anyhow I agree we just want a squat there's three ... and and Sally and those guys need to be targeted in jail\nAnd somehow taken taken away and I don't think I don't think there's any Supreme Court that's going to say no in orange county you have to put up with these guys if they want to sit in the street and ... you're in a any jak they're allowed to you got to just eat it I Know Supreme Court's going to say that\nJudge Carter to his credit he re emphasize is that over and over he is not taking away nor does he want to take away the right to arrest he does not want us to lose that right\nI gotta I
