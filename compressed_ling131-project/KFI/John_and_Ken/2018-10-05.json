nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh devote limits debate time still a final confirmation vote can be held this weekend majority leader Mitch McConnell told senators the initial vote makes a statement whether the ...\nThe correct title for proposition ... shouldn't read proposition six gas tax repeal initiative a yes vote would repeal the gas in our tax hikes is right that is terrific\nAnd they were ... government sent its official correction from like the secretary of state or the secretary of the attorney general who's responsible for that to craft the language\nAttorney general it is yeah yeah no and and look we've we've brought cases in the past uh on our pension reform measure and twenty sixteen we sued\nAnd uh the judge said look I'm I'm sympathetic or the attorney general is misleading people because he said that it was Kamala Harris back then she said we were eliminating people's retirements and that's not true but what I said I'm sympathetic it's misleading but\nThe constitution gives the power to the attorney general you don't like the ballot title get yourself a new attorney general and guys I Can't argue with that I mean it it didn't you know bode well for us but I I I understand that they control the power\nWell we have to do is just be very smart about getting the word out and I know that Jerry Brown when he sees that is going to he's going to spit up his oatmeal this morning I get so upset he's going to say how can they do this well first and foremost it's illegal or legal and it's just creative and we just got to be creative with how we get\nThe word out but I Need help and that is your ability to tell your friends and family is powerful and so what you need to do is call them in an email 'em and text him and post on Facebook saying hey your ballot has an\nError eight is misleading prop six is not what they say it is but it's a false\nTitle it's the gas tax repeal measure vote yes you me everyone we can get the word out we have to believe that ultimately that people can send a message that if you if you try to defraud us of a fair vote we're going to figure it out we're gonna\nWe're gonna punish the polls are bearing the south though is that was you know you you want it's about two weeks ago and now the policy that came out this week also seemed indicated because they have to separate question yeah and it got fifty percent with people told both prop six the gas tax repeal oh really\nSo you had John Thomas on at the John Thomas poll on radio and so um\nI called him and I said hey I'm ... you know your poll shows that were doing really well what did you test you said what\nTested the title and I said what did you test specifically you read it to me he tested our ballot title from the initiative I said John baton on our ballot title and he didn't know either and so he's going to be updating the poll but I Will tell you right now in our own internal polling shows that we're behind just based on ballot title\nOf it but we do a different pole we basically gave people the ability to like you know decide if they wanted more information we said here's the ballot title or would you vote yes no or would you want more information or look for more information before you vote twenty percent yes twenty six percent now\nAnd fifty four percent said no I'm not going to just you say you're ... yes or no based on a title I'm going to look a little bit more of a school so there is a silver lining the silver lining as I think the\nTPS depots overstated in terms of our our our deficit right um the other polls that say gas acts where people are way overstated in terms of how far ahead we are in the polls are okay ah but\nI think that right now it's a coin toss race so everyone who tells a friend or family member it you are having a major eight are there\nAny way to cash what people do in their heads about ... now because if they know in their heads that it's the gas tax\nYou win big yeah and the ... what what what are the problem I'm having with all the polls is it it it does to gauge what a person knows\nYeah and and and that's a challenge when at least you're you're you're pulling on candidate races you can say are you gonna vote for the Democratic or Republican yeah that's pretty stable I a\nHigh profile race new some or well I guess Cox not a lot of people known but anyway Cox uh knew some of the other guy or you can get a good poll there but on a ballot measure numbers or whatever like I don't know what a B measure em em measure twenty seven is but\nWhen you say gas tax repeal overwhelming two thirds want to repeal it and that's why these politicians had to lie on this title because they know that if they gave us a real title and honest title we'd went overwhelmingly doesn't matter how much they spent so this is part of their effort to to mislead and deceive\nAnd we can when we're gonna win as long as we get people to spread the word it over and we are going to repeat this constantly yes unfair Shasta actress as right gas tax\nRepeal dot org because you guys have to fund this campaign\nAnd without where we don't have the money to do the mail or to the poll voters there are no\nRepublicans left to finance anything in California rarely I just amazed\nWhen I went to their meeting the other day and the phone booth I'm and I'm a I yeah no there's not a whole lot their

then California over first twenty twenty but in California we have had Fifteen Years to get it together but here's the scary thing and the thing you have to know about this\nThat there's been a huge uptick in wait times at the in the offices and clearly most of it it's been not only the DMV incompetence but the real ID act\nYou know how many licenses and all this time they issued just a million and a half you know how many more they're gonna have to put out where new rules that comply with the ... the act by October first twenty twenty twenty three and a half million more\nSo if they had this much problems with one and a half million that they've accomplished so far how in the hell in the next two years are they going to be able to process twenty three and a half million California

was broken are crowded\nAnd she said she got permission to just urinate right there on the floor got battling away on the phone while she does this might have been before the plane took off I don't know\nWhat what country she from\nShe sounded Eastern European from what I listen to this other story is a a picture of a\nI'm a mother apparently takes her toddler into the aisle and takes out one of those little child parties and just what's her kid start cramping right there into the little part of you know [laughter] she bought her own party on board set it in the Iowa mid flight to have the

two did mobster witness said it was just like in the movies\nHe saw the car pull up to the drive through in the Bronx McDonalds and some guy came running up to the car and just started shooting right to the passenger side window and killed what is supposed to be an old mobster a Seventy year old man\nHe goes we hear bang bang bang sounded like firecrackers and someone said no that sounds like a gunfight then we hear all the ambulances and the cops come and I saw the bodies had was hanging outside the window\n[laughter] that's great [laughter]\nYou take two shots the red to strip it on the floor was disgusting there's blood everywhere [laughter] that's good to know mobsters still do that to each other by the way ms Sylvester as a whole lot to the guy is that was killed is anyone ever go to a movie and say wow that's just like real life [laughter] no no no [laughter]\nWell I mean where do you think the guy the the the movie guys got the idea is what they get it from you know because you know technology is becoming a and movies is such a big deal in America to make them better in terms of looking realistic\nThese kinds of scenes like John ... coming up next the president of the hour Jarvis taxpayers association we thought we'd spend a little extra time on this it's going to be a special section of the voter guide many cities and towns across Southern California want you to raise the sales tax of course we're telling you know what\nWe'll just talk about the reasons for this coming up John and can show Deborah Marquez venues KFI am six forty\nOkay Hi how are you already cremation\nChaos some Deborah Martin live on the KFI twenty four hour news from the Senate has voted to advance the Supreme Court nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh the boat limits debate so a final confirmation vote can be held this weekend Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins says she will the chickens from she was one of\nA handful of senators who could have gone either way calling spoke on the Senate floor today she says the confirmation process has become dysfunctional with opposition even before Kavanaugh's name was announced\nSince that time we had seen special interest groups with their followers in to a friend and by spreading misrepresentation and outright\nFalsehoods about judge Kavanaugh as she ...\nShe says she has reviewed Kavanaugh's record as a federal judge met with him for more than two hours and listen to testimony at the committee hearings she says allegations of sexual assault through the process into a tailspin and talked about due process and the presumption of innocence\nWest Virginia democratic Senator Joe Manchin says he too will vote to confirm Kavanaugh he was surrounded by protesters after\nAnnouncing which way he would go\nI think everyone everyone labor everybody later\nHe is the only Democrat who voted this morning to advance the confirmation process he says he has reservations because of the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh and the judges temperament and denying them but he says he is voting for what is best for West Virginia\nMarine veteran and convicted serial killer and you already all this has been sentenced to death for murdering five women in Southern California\nAnd he also [noise] all in a black suit and black reading glasses already Alice showed no emotion that families address for it\nAnd not only count my daughter called me inside Iran my family\nOr my family are hardy Alice apologized for the family members\n... and given death twice before for killing three other women in Illinois at the ... the superior court in Santa Ana core Ben Carson KFI new\nIn Chicago have reached a verdict of guilty and\nBut the or a Democrat a professor but very good on this issue David Crane he has written extensively on the pension issue he predicted at the time that we could we wouldn't be able to trace\nAll the proper thirty revenue going eventually into all the pensions for pension fund whether they were ... or ... and he was right he's now do the calculation and he's done a backward looking analysis of the property tax increases and as he predicted it all went to Penn so\nWe we said that years ago that people were going to get fooled into taxing the wealthy when the money was going to go nuts for schools but for pensions yep and that's exactly what happened and it was nearly all of it\nBecause they need all of that because they're so under funded for all the promises they made\nRight now there every once in a while you'll see an outlier in these sales tax proposal they will actually dedicate it for a specific purpose but when they do that they needed two thirds vote no in some communities some smaller communities they say this is going to be a police tax\nWe one or two thirds vote and we have to use it for police services now that's the honest way of doing it what what all the other communities but like I said that's the outlier most of these other communities will say you know if you want police protection you have to vote for this\nSales tax increase but it is a general fund tax increase without legal restrictions and that is the big red flag whenever you see that that critical language for any governmental purpose or\nFor any for general governmental services that's a red flag people just to have in their mind that when they see that that means pensions\nNow their budgets are really being pinched that's part of their complaining as we've talked about before I think with you John ... with the president to the German taxpayers association I mean ... was putting out this idea that they were going to earn seven and a half percent ready to return to their investments\nBut they they knock that number down to seven percent which means they have to get more from the cities and towns and that right\nAh yes and that seven percent that's the estimated rate of return and that still high even even in this market um again\nUh kelp hers is completely messed up it's a it's a project in rates of return are way off its governance is horrible they just voted thank God there are current ... president and they've got someone who is a little bit better in there but\nThese public employee pension funds are too big to mismanaged\nThe the the ultimate answer of course is a phase out of the defined\nBenefit plans in a phase in a defined contributions like everybody else has four oh one case which can be very generous by the way they can but they take away this government control this quasi government control from these pension funds and actually best to control\nAn individual it's just too much I mean ultimately\n... there's no tax rate high enough to pay for all this\nTension day it just isn't possible he either cities are going to go bankrupt it's going to go to court yes then the the employees are going to end up taking taking a A R cut Sunday there's just simply not enough money printed for this\nYear I think that's right if you add up you know and when people say well how much are these funds\nUnder funded the answer is always well it depends how did the stock market today because the you know they've got their the biggest ... of the biggest institutional investor in on the planet the biggest in the world\nAnd they carry a lot of weight but they're still mis manage the problem is we haven't had another recession in a long time they're performing poorly in a good economy\nWhat happens what happens when\nThe inevitable recession comes\nThey don't even make good investments when everything is going up [laughter]\nWell and also do that how do you find a bad investments in in during this time period\nWell first of all they hide their own hands behind their back by saying well we're not going to invest in oil or fracking or firearms for all this stuff that\nVote chicken for judge Kaplan\nCollins both for close to an hour today on the Senate floor she says she has met with Kavanaugh\nConsidered his record as a federal judge in talks with people who have known him she says she believes Christine Blasey Ford was the victim of sexual assault but says there is nothing to corroborate her claim that it was Kavanaugh\nShe called the allegations of cabinet enabling gained grape outrageous with no supporting evidence West Virginia democratic Senator Joe Manchin says he too will vote to confirm Kavanaugh this morning the Senate voted to advance the nomination\nThose limits debate so a final confirmation vote can be held this weekend traffic from the helpful so Cal Honda
