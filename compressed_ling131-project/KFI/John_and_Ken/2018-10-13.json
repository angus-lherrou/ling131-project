including of course the voice find people's stuff I\nWe'll start with a road diet and Pasadena\nRecovered a few months ago I was an update their with the city council meeting coming Monday [noise]\nUh you probably just her little W mention\nI got a little more a little more detail I shouldn't call you a little W renews woman you deserve you know Rick I deserve recognition ... mark it's OK my friends do call me daddy I have to say you don't like it\nYou know what I Am called Deborah Debbie dab dumpster I haven't been called so many different things\nGo yeah how can a dempster new new idea a there's a fire that's broken out\nIn the San Bernardino mountains north of Cal State San Bernardino it started about three hours ago are now the reason we're mentioning it obviously it's a fire we talk about fires it's it's grown to fifty acres I don't know where it is now but it says here by late afternoon most of the flames appear to be out\nBut they're still battling against the hotspots the reason we're talking about it is that there are NOW News reports that they have detained to people and one of them might be a female transient and what did you say she appears to have been smoking\nSmoking so accidentally smoking on a hillside wait a minute and she [laughter] she no she wasn't accidentally smoking she was smoking and accidentally started the fire money you know that well that's what police are saying\nAnd how did they did they have video of her smoking on the hillside and I I I did witnesses report they saw her up there smoking and then we had a fire in could be her and I mean eventually they'll find out they get to the\nPlace where the fire started they do their work and they can actually tell him not even find a cigarette butt or whatever it is that started the fire but I Wonder if she was camped out there or she was just hanging out on the hillside I\nYeah we're still waiting for all that info\nYou know it's people and they're all listed say this well you know you wanted I talked about this last hour you want the homeless sometimes to live in these isolated areas so they're not stuck in the middle of our neighborhoods you know are in schools and where people live\nBut if they end up way off in the mountains there they can start some pretty nasty fires and we found out of course the famous barn and fire\nOn the west side near the Getty Center there was an encampment there and when people were colder wanted to cook they were starting fires to ah make their food or whatever and they cause\nA big fires too so you know it's tough to have it both ways if you want them in these isolated deserted areas well then they're probably going to do stuff like this I have no idea if this one was camping there\nIf she lived there I mean I I'm looking at the photos this looks like a pretty\nEmpty place it and how close to this to Cal State university San Bernardino they're calling it the north park fire does that mean there's a park there somewhere that she may have been at the transit may have been hanging out with her because usually it's where the origins of the further named after that oh I see no new Northport boulevard and mountain drive the fire started just before two PM\nAnd can just put this out there when you are near dry brush why are you going to be smoking\nBecause smokers are stupid and they don't care OK I'm Glad you said that well yeah that's why I'm here I now because there are some people that don't care and sometimes they're smokers is that better\nYes but it's just so obvious I see people just licking their lips cigarettes out in these areas and hello what do you think's gonna happen\n[noise] but yeah I I just I don't think people care I I and I've seen science to the ... actually they prohibit smoking in places where fires can start like this exactly I'll be doesn't always matter to people but you know\nHow many times ... most of the climate change but how many times and many fires we're hearing there started by people are there still like power lines\nI think I just heard yesterday the day before that one of the big fires that hit northern California last year is definitely been connected now to Pacific gas and electric power lines of just went down went off\nIs what happens they have to come up with better technology first of all we have to get rid of all the stupid people that smoke and flick cigarettes\nAnd then the homeless people hanging out in areas of burn and then you've got to be utility companies have to do something about their equipment and about the power lines they put up they're going to make much more wind resistant there's a lot more that they have to do and then of course there's the clearing of the brush\nWhich is something else is way overdue going to get rid of all the dead stop that's going to burn heart five o'clock hour is here so a lot to do we'll start with the road diet topic\nLooks like Pasadena is going to vote perhaps Monday on the road diet there
