investigate but it looks like they were not given the go ahead to interview Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford that the White House put limits on on these interviews\nAnd instead said that\nThey would have to use the testimony from last Thursday from Kavanaugh and Ford and that's what they would have to use to be in place of an interview\nThat doesn't make\nIt makes it zero sense it obviously doesn't\nJibe with what the White House had been saying about all of this because the White House had been saying that they would allow the Senate to make the determination as to the scope of who was going to be spoken with and who wouldn't be\nThere was criticism because there was talk of the White House putting limits on the scope of the investigation I'm Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that both Ford and cabinet had been questioned by senators envy most public way possible an indication that the White House didn't believe it would have been necessary for them to do that\nBut that's not up to the White House that should be up to the FBI the investigators what do they think they need to come to a conclusion actually if\nYou were ... if you were saying that you were doing it because you want to transparency and openness and all of this um there's also a a letter to Chuck Grassley the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat says recorded or regarding the documents

investigation if you don't interview the two people question maybe it's all here say from other people have you gone through doing process and you're not allowing those two people to be interviewed\nIt doesn't make any sense especially because the White House yesterday said oh they can do whatever they want to whatever the investigators need an attempt to ever you want open up the two people in question it it's not an investigation\nWell Los Angeles Dodgers sick our minds off of it and talk about something more important return to the\nPost season for the sixth consecutive

the\nDodgers are the Dodgers are ahead yeah\nSo the Braves have only taken two games for them and normalcy\nAnd the regulations so the other the big news baseball wise tonight or today was that the Rockies beat the cubs\nTwo to one in Thirteen innings last night in what was just an absolute barn burner of a game that I Know that doesn't sound like it if you're not a baseball fan but two to one was a spectacular score\nWhere the umpire almost got taken out of the game late in the game because they got hit by a pitch a where the cubs I think set a record by plank twenty three different

right so we've got a kicker who missed a couple of extra points and a field goal on Sunday ... charges kicking was continuing and then it's like okay so we're going to keep the kicker but get rid of the punter we're going to get rid of the guy who was holding\nFor him but apparently yes that's exactly what they're going to do they haven't been how happy withdrew caves are holding or his plans

where he was just listening all the freeway projects that are that would be imperiled if the if the yes on six ends up succeeding um here's a little bit of what he had to say about\nWhether or not people should be ready to give up the you know essentially what they would win if they just gave up twelve cents per gallon\nNext time you're stuck in the horseshoe because you decided to save a couple of pennies at the gas bumper you thought you were gas companies jacks up your gas anyway you're paying the same the gas pump and you're stuck in the central terminal area trying to pick up your friend a drop off or family member what uh that's because of prop six let's not have\nSo essentially he's saying that ... isn't here I if if you know boy [laughter] well he's saying that the real

about it and his response I think was pretty informative it's a little bit longer you guys caught me off when you're ready but this is what he a sudden in response\nWe can't wait somebody's life going to be lost or waiting for them to put them on the ballot or hotter there are a bunch of talk they could have stepped up and pass something in fact this was bipartisan we had Republicans who voted yes on all of them like a democratic issue this is about one thing\nIs about voter turnout in a gubernatorial election trying to stir passions to get people to vote on other things and I got a lot of opinions about those other things we're not talking about those here today\nWe're not talking about the house of representatives were talking about your house we're talking about your car and you're

spending on this ... it was interesting because as I Would have to you on that question\nI as I was asking them that question I mean there was a run up to the question itself and and I saw him you know the wheels spinning and he was really just getting ready as though he was just waiting for this question to be trying to think of his head on the talking points you memorized I well I think that this is one\nOf the more powerful arguments that the yes on six campaign has is that oh well we have these other things down the road and twenty twenty that voters can vote on and it will replace whatever funding is lost and so I think that the ... campaign sees that\nAnd says well no as he said we we can't wait we've got to get these projects done first because they knew see it as a
