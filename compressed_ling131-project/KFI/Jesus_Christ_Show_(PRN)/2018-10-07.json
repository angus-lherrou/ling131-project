Palin perpetuate the ideas\nOf Christianity however are desires to do it in a way it's different\n\nBecause the traditions don't always work the traditional way of doing things don't are always compel and sometimes get look archaic and get left behind and that's not to say that you take scissors to scripture and take out what you don't like or just say well that was then this is now that's not what I'm saying\nWhat I'm saying is understand the purpose of traditions\nIf you remember and you can read this and mark seven I was constantly being poked ... prodded tested by the religious leaders of my day\n\nTwo thousand years go everywhere I went somebody was trying to corner me\n\nTo get me to do to make some statements some contradictory statements something that we've caused an uproar either in the Roman community\n\nAnd the Jewish community\nAnd a lot of the things that were asked of me and a lot of lot of the opportunities that were taken were really based on\nTradition what do you think of this tradition what do you think of that tradition and in March seven you can read in the first one that the fairest sees\nAnd also at the time some of the scribes were coming together and they were focused on me as they started to gather around me\nThey had some questions as they are and wants to do\n\nAnd one of these questions and to do with why might disciples were eating their bread with impure hands\nNow and not to get totally into what impure hands deal with I mean there was a ceremonial washing it would take place with a handful of water especially if you just came from the marketplace\nAnd that you might be mixing with things unclean maybe gentile things money cancels any of those things\nThe tradition was to wash your hands now\nOn the half [noise] when they break

disagree on 'em but the truth of the matter is that ah\nWhen someone is excommunicated from church the church has that right based on whatever their structure is as long as everybody knows that going into it than they're signing off on that saying okay I won't do that or I won't partake in those things where I won't be a part of that or bring that into the church\nThere is in the sun is not a sun

of an illness\nOh I yeah because I was on like a ... a\nGood lord me through [laughter] I Know for me I'm just waiting for him to tell me what that is [noise] but I don't know I guess I'm confused I don't know why am I think that dreams and why it would be\nWell my Google will dreams or dreams play many parts in scripture and sometimes a dream is a dream and most often people trains the dreams of liberal but the most common theory and and one of the best theory is\nIf you imagined a mirror big mirror that ah was reflecting one of your bedrooms let's say in your home and you could see everything you know states your bedroom it's got the clock\nThe table don't lamp that beautiful lamp you love so much you can see your bed the window and a kids playing on the outside in the tree and the bird and all these things in the mirror and then if you went and you broke the mirror\nAnd twisted pieces now would shift their perspective\nAnd now a there'd be a maybe you would just see the bird instead of the kids playing outside the window\nAnd now the lamp would be just above the bird so it would look as if the lamp was on top of the bird's head and all these things or distorted view of something that you already know or things that are in your life on a day to day basis or or in your heart or your head\nSo a dream often is is very disjointed\nAnd that's why when you wake up and you trust\nPiece it together um you're saying while I was in my house but it wasn't my house but I knew it was my house but it didn't look anything like my house and you start doing those things 'cause you're starting to try and reconstruct something that is torn apart it in his all piecemeal and and it can be confusing\nSo I wouldn't take that that dream per se\nUm as liberal as much as it is that yes you had a traumatic experience and you thought probably a lot about death and what that would have been like\nAnd what being absent from the body or being absent from this world would be like it also made you think about those that you cared about it and or knew that had moved on before you and that comes together in a dream\nUm that can be a little creepy and sad\nAnd those types of things so I don't know that you're going to pull direct meaning out of it but I Will say this throughout scripture although it doesn't speak specifically\nTo Pete TST and keep in mind PATS use thrown around a lot there's very different forms and for different reasons um there's those that come back from combat in the military and that's a very specific and different kinds of but there's those that they get it from watching someone they care about passing away or\nIn your case you going through something physically\nUm draining that was scary and potentially life threatening\nAnd you go through all those things and they cause you to wonder about your stability it's like\nYou live every day with the stability it's it's it's like if you could feel the earth move how unsettling that would be um you don't think about it solid it's not it's moving all the time and there's things like that that you\nKind of ignore to get through life and when you're faced with them it can shake your foundation and make you quite nervous\nI Will say that there are scriptures that talk about comfort\nAnd talk about the process of comfort second Corinthians won three through five\nAnd it's a little interesting the way it's worded so I asked you to hear it in its fullness it says praise be to God and father and father of our Lord Jesus Christ\nThe father of compassion and the God of all comfort comforts us in our troubles so that we can come for those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves received from God\nFor justice we share abundantly\nIn the sufferings of Christ so also our comfort of bounds through Christ now the word comfort\nIs you so much there it gets kind of tied up in all of it but when you see it laid out it's talking about the compassion of the father and the the God of all comfort every comfort comes from God\nThe piece of life that you enjoy the things the stability in your life Debbie come from God\nSo it talks about God being the author of all of that comfort\nGoes on to say not only has got the author of comfort but God actively comfort you and your troubles why so that you also Pete comfort others in trouble with what with the comfort\nThat you received from God\nBut first five is interesting because it doesn't say if there's no ifs here there's no maybe says for just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ\nIt it moves what in your mind was beyond movable\nAnd you walk through life you go through life going I Believe this is the way things are going to work you walk through life believing that your wife or your husband when they say they're going to love you and be with you forever that they're going to do that\n\nYour children believe when you say you're going to protect them you're going to do that\nThat everything's going to be okay that everything's gonna be okay but the reality is that's not the way things work and there are problems and there's pain and their allies and there are accidents and things happen\nAnd if you bank on the world always being okay\nAnd if you expect there's never going to be any problems you're going to be surprised and your world will get rocked but if you trust in God that does not move that is always the same that is where the true stability in life comes from\n\nMom\nDied when\n\nOn the half when a bridge I'm\nJulie later in life and they have high twenty four hour news rooms

people that you go to church ask them you know why why what God or how\nHow how to fight it out of their work how do you how do you believe in it so so faithfully how do you believe that he's there how can you trust\n[noise] well it's interesting that you talk about bad things happening\nAnd you also talked about good things happening there's people that have good things happen to them and you point out the bad things happen what's a what's a bad thing how could you describe what a good thing was or bad thing was if there wasn't some rulers some judge something\nThere is nothing in science that ever says something comes from nothing science says the cause is always greater than the effect lift the effective set is something the cause can't be nothing\nThere's plenty I could do this all day Gary but it means nothing if you're not willing to apply it to your life\nI understand do you yeah so what do you do next\nContinue studying said take take that take that first step I guess I'm I'm thinking to build on it\nIndeed you have to have a foundation your foundation has to be dirty just like anything else did your parents ever have faith\nUm we never really talked much about that I mean they're good parents my dad passed away [noise] mom still here but I mean we didn't really go to church or anything like that\nNo grandparents or anything where people um\nKnow and no one ever talked about God okay my my friends talk more about it but it's not they're not a Christian they're\nThey're they're more spiritual than and I guess\nAs spirituality spirituality doesn't get too much on his own because it doesn't\nIt's like a the concept of free love rather than a relationship it doesn't it doesn't land anywhere there's no accountability and I think you need accountability\nAnd it it you need that structure so this is something you're going to have to build from scratch no one has pointed you in a direction and I'm saying that if you get into scripture and you find yourself a good Bible teaching Bible believing church\nThat is palatable to you the way they worship and all those things um give them a little bit of your trust to learn and then if any red flags go up or you have any concerns you call me back okay\nSounds good and then we'll talk again [noise]\nOr [noise] so do we\nDo have a crash on the ... street to ... and now they're moving to the right shoulder

actually apply it but there's a lot of counterfeit sat there and there's a lot of people that want to point you in the wrong direction and the gift that that can be scary but doing nothing is not an option either because that becomes a decision\nOr that's passive and then that passive decision you end up\nHaving consequences and your life whether you want them or not\nSo better to do your

it\nWas so you're saying you don't want to have communication with God because you don't think it's going to change the outcome\n[noise] well I Believe that the outcome\nIs gonna be okay you know based on my salvation based on everything that word has done for me\nOkay man that's fair enough but ... but why not have a relationship while you're here\nIt really hurts what does it\nWell you know it's like\nThere I Am going through something that is excruciating isn't it it's still excruciating and that doesn't get taken away\nBut you know\nThe building the relationship with God is not to take away the bad things in your life but things will continue to happen to have the pillar to lean on and to have that strengthen that promise that bolsters you that builds you up in a way to be able to take those trials or those Shakespearean slings and arrows that\nYou take on every day\n[noise] [noise] well when you said being my puller you know I think of the lord as my pillar in\nKnowing that I Will be in the end everything's going to come out okay and when I Am in heaven everything will be okay but it's really hard when I'm going through something that is so painful\nTo connect because it doesn't make it any less painful\nYou know\nI mean I don't just leave it at all it's just\nI don't want things that I'm experiencing that are that are horrible from time to um well to be so horrible it's like it's okay if they happen but you know I just needed to not maybe the so horrible sometimes\nWell God is not anesthesia God is there not to ... to to numb you\nFrom the things in this world as a matter of fact it's not just about the promise at the end otherwise why did got put you here\nThere's there's things to learn here and part of the learning process is learning to rely on God to lean on God through times of pain if you're not doing that yes it retards the\nThe relationship\nAnd I'm I and I know you're going ... you're you have there's this disconnect in in your logic there's some a disconnect in their in what you're doing now I realize you said your an abuse survivor a that was at the hands of a parent\nOr there were a number of things that were going on there was a hazing during my high school years and there was some incest\nAlthough I actually think the hazing was worse [laughter]\n[noise] in in that but when you're dealing with a peers in one case and dealing with uh people that you should trust that skews how you see life most certainly yeah\nA God transcends those things and often because of the term you know a godfather God the sun or these types of things those terms that people can apply them\nAre in those common roles in life and when there's problems in their childhood whether it'd be with a ... a parent or something like that that it does make that family structure skewed and makes it difficult to see sometimes in to connect with God\nBecause of that but you're reasoning that you don't want to connect\nWith God because there's problems in the world on day to day basis I'm just not sure\nWhat that means\nWell what am I relying on the lord for I we I ...
