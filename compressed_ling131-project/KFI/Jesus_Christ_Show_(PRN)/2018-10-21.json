{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "You know um it's interesting I think there are no I'm not an accent that there are no coincidence is in life I um I think there are several things in my life that are brought me to the work that I'm doing and why in particular is\nWhen I was in my twenties I worked for a gang prevention program and um Orange County and met a young girl with the amount of the most beautiful smiles I've ever seen and I'm never realized until about six months after knowing that she was hiding a secret our family and\nThat secret was that hard that would abuse her mum on a regular basis and in order to get the abuse to stop she um or physically intervene becoming the person that and\nThat that would put 'em all of his anger on too and um and it was something really as a young professional really difficult to see and to know really um become aware because it was something that I realized you know there are a lot of children and teens really living\nThrough that and experience in that in the household not only personally but then also going to school and maybe not nine how to navigate ... violence and so\nI'm at the time there was really not a lot that um I was able to do the unprofessional ... there were limited options with the system that I'm over time I really began to learn about options and\nHuman options I was wondering are innovations that I came to know of and fortunately I'm I was able to become a part of the organization and the and that for about the last twelve years now\nOkay so let's talk about what you do because human options is one of many groups and specifically how do you help people and domestic violence how even find\nSure um you know I think it's a combination I don't know that we are always finding them as much as making sure that they're able to find that I'm so there's different ways people become aware of less direct community partnerships um information that we put out in different places\nUm another thing that we do is really work with first responders and ambassadors and the community to make sure that when somebody comes forward are able to find that I'm so we have a twenty four hour hotline that we have um locally and then we work with\nThe national genetic bonds hotlines as well so then somebody local could find less if they called the hotline first what's your how um [noise] I'm Sorry I don't I didn't think you'd be the phone number I um\nActually no no worries a Carly Carly centers as one of your ambassadors rice you correct the teen about program I actually I think we have a car early on the phone and currently do you have that hotline number on you\nYes I Do actually so it's one eight hundred Seventy seven eight five four three five that\nWonderful thank you Carl Lee and welcome thanks for joining us you know that your the teen ...\nOff for a you know you're an advocate for the community to help prevent relationship violence which I think it's really important especially since you guys yeah world of social media you digital natives uh that's all based on I think a lot of folks don't understand\nAnd there's a lot of bowling their cetera et cetera and it leads to domestic violence right or can't yeah um you are Seventeen and how did you come to the program\nShow um I actually found out about human options to start shutting rallies and she actually works Feynman options as well and I hadn't done it for a couple of years back while she was outgrown ink\n'em to shoot my advisor for about two years going on to carry and I I began doing the safety of program through human options and there was a six week\nCourse and it just you know it was talking about can let's take violent too when I'm you know the general and how people are affected in the ... and everything\nAnd so when that was over she gave us the opportunity to become investors and of course that was all in for it because I had already become so passionate about learning about teen domestic violence and you know just seeing how many people around me were being affected by this and lifestyles even I was so shocked by learning things that\nI didn't even know where being abusive\nWell it sounds like a blessing that you know you're there but it doesn't sound like you live it in your family circle but it's great that you understand how important is to be an advocate\nAnd of course in ... as a C.

truly matter in life\nAnd of course the afterlife\nI'd love to hear from you if you have a theology questioner life situation question anywhere in the U.S of a dial eight seven seven holy host

more of the show during the week that's the way to do it you'll see a little box they're quick to find out more about our archive club\nWe'd love to have you be a part of that it if you are so inclined otherwise we're here for you every single Sunday no problem\nSame time same place and you can follow us on Twitter at Jesus' show at Jesus' show\nWe were talking with Jeanie Jeanie there yes I Am now your husband uh is is having issues with the fact that the babies are born with with disabilities and Pete's on his face\nPardon the St Pete's in faith for food but does he have faces era yeah okay yeah so he wrestles with it doesn't keep them from having face but it it he wrestles with it right\nIn ... for ... friends up to hurt somehow I I don't know well I Want to help them that I I've gotten side cat on\nIt is normal and it is healthy for him to question these things because it shows compassion on his part and and that's a good thing yeah so the question becomes you know I guess academically it becomes will know why does God allow these things right and not just reach in well it sounds simple\nBut it's kind of like when you start looking at things that you don't like in the United states and you start going I you know I don't like the way that person thinks oh I don't like the way they act I wish we could just ban that then what ends up happening is what in the United states or the constitution says once you start banning that than\nThe things you can build you believe in can be banned as well and it starts this whole cycle right the breaks down the entirety of the system so you have to let people be who they are um within reason as long as it doesn't cause danger harmed anyone else if you allow people to be who they are even if you disagree now you stretch that\nOr to God looking over the universe and everything in it and saying what I Want are creatures that can love and the only way creatures can truly love is to allow them the option not to laugh\nSo are the only way you can allow creatures truly love God or anything else the the only reason your husband knows that you love him is because you come home to him every night by choice\nThat you eat if you had a gun to your head it wouldn't be love right right you'd just be doing it because he was forcing you so God force people to do right it's no longer doing right it's like the uh\nUh you know putting a murderer in solitary confinement he doesn't murder anymore right he's not good because if you had the opportunity you would murder right so just because uh you know just because you took\nA the morality out of it or you assume that you know I keep a this prisoner I'm so we can't kill that he now he's a better person no it just means he doesn't have the opportunity or the choice that is not better that's without any morality so\nGod in order to to create a a a creature that has that can truly love has to give them an option not to laugh so what these creatures do some of them go towards gone\nSeeking God seeking God's will in God's love and love and God and therefore trying to abide by the rules of God which are the rules of universe truly\nAnd I'm a when it comes to pollution or drugs or things like that um they would uh shun them but then there are those that look to cut corners to make more money to build a their empire to do\nAnd the things are to get high to do whatever that uh pollutes the genetic line\nAnd then what ends up happening is you have mutations now I'm not saying the parents of some of a of a disabled child have done something they're ... themselves you're talking about it could be generations and generations generations of a a a go of people that they don't know\nI'm the purpose of that is to understand that everybody is responsible for one another and in in doing that you know it keeping in mind that there is the percentage\nOf of Americans that are disabled is approximately about Seventeen percent and of that percentage of disabled people about fifty percent of them are born that way so it it it makes you one say does it is a disabled person worth less than you\nOf course not of course not so what he looks at is the quality well why does this happen at all and and why would you know why we got allow this it has to be allowed in the process of things because in order to eliminate that I'm very boy that possibility would be to have to take away\nThe consequences of anything that people did wrong\nAnd you have to allow consequences in life because that that helps build character it's like um if you think about all the wonderful things in life that you know ... courage all these things\nDo you need those don't exist without a diversity do they uh you know a fireman or a firefighter cannot be a hero without a fire or some sort of adversity same with the law enforcement or anything like that\nSo if the balance of adversity\nAnd faith in strength and ability and all these things love versus a indifference or even hate that these things only exist in this world in this way because this is not the best world Jeannie it's the best way to the best world which is heaven\nAnd the reason why states the best ways because you have to go through this process\nOr to understand\nAnd therefore once you're in heaven there won't be any of that there won't be any a disability in heaven there won't be in tears in heaven there won't be any of that but here there has to be those things as long as people a\nMess with the genetic line by doing what they want when they want\nA and a once again I Want to clarify this because some people try and push this on to the parents and if you remember in scripture um if someone came to me and said uh you know this man's blind why's he blind as if something is it a sin he did or send that his parents did and I said ... and neither had nothing to do with that um\nBut the line that genetic wind does have impurities in it that people are placed there that were never supposed to be there in the garden it's not the way it was designed and so these things take place and I know that\nBe with you this Sunday as I Am every single Sunday right here answering your

[noise]\nUm Haiti a ... and have for sale on us [noise] um he professes to last name says it happy they really is is the phone is self destructive and doesn't really respect my opinions\nAnd it's really just kind of a written that situation I I just had such difficulty ah living here in LA that that you would and where to draw the line\nHow long have you guys been together for a long time and when did he started drinking from the beginning was was he a drunk when you guys are met\nMy girlfriend recognized it early on 'em that I never knew what alcoholic and what if I ever saw it as a\nOkay well we're not talking about just the the academics at all you did you see him drunk\nMhm yeah did you see him do stupid things when he was drunk\nI'm\nOK yeah and you you you needed a formal definition that wasn't good enough for you\nKnow I just didn't I just thought it yeah I thought he grow out of it really does it go up twenty\nFive years that's a long time and I you know made excuses I I did a majority of the work at home including the financials and keeping thanks for falling into disrepair of you know I just and I thought all this effort with please and they can live apart it can have it not apart you\nKnow it doesn't sound like it's not even a partner doing stuff you know not even a whole human being he's broken\nIt right but he is broken and then\nHe needs help and he doesn't need help of you're turning your head and pretending like it doesn't exist ie he needs to be put into um a a system of structure that will help them remove this uh from his life I'm as a daily practice\nYeah and is he willing to do then is he willing to go to a or\n[noise] if you think that's what I should do I can I can watch it again and we had to counseling and that they say what's so bad you know what's wrong with that so that you have a job\nOr steadily yeah yeah and and that's just that it's like no no and you know it's always been that everything else has enough can they carry carry a lot of such\nOkay well what it what it comes down to Lisa is I always prefer reconciliation however if he gets me and he gets hurtful towards you in any way I don't want you to stay in a in a position of being harmed\nBut you see it it's not like throwing up your arms people need to fight for\nUm what they want people need to fight for the relationships that they start and you you need to fight for your marriage and by doing that is not just trying to please him is trying to do what's right and that means putting them in the program and having him worked up program to its fullest ah one day at a time to get himself clean\nThat's what it means are going through detox or doing whatever he needs to do and if he's not willing to do that that he's not willing to be a participant in the marriage and then there is no marriage to fight for\nBut at this point you've you've got to take a stand and say this is what we need for for this marriage to work you to get healthy and this is the way to do it\nOh Jesus Christ Jerome will return in a moment to be a part of a show called seven seven holy host [noise]\nSome on here you for someone who shares\nI'm On there is so much

know anything\nAbout it\nAnd you and you may never I mean law enforcement will do the best they can find out the answers but when you have when you have someone like your grandson there and then another group of people they may be the only witness as\nWell I don't know if somebody had to call nine one one he had bullet holes in his chest ... you know I mean just riding a bike\nAnd and being ambush like that for no reason at all ... ... ... ... nobody can realize how devastating that is I'm an old lady I'm eighty two years old but\nI I my my health is I'll never be the same again and needed what was mom you know it it's just so devastating and these people don't they know that they kill off everybody along with is\nNo they're not thinking like that for me they're not thinking the way you think\nYou know 'cause I could never heard anybody know of course not\nWouldn't even put my hand on a gun or even get near one and they go round carrying guns I don't I don't I mean I'm so confusing so injured\nI think another child I Hope it goes right to having\nA of your grandson yes there is there any reason for you to believe otherwise no and then they go\nNo you must be confident and in a way that in all this chaos\nUm that that the father has a plan\nAnd it says that in scripture that God turns all things days glory and will reach and even into the ugliest times and there will be glory there will be good that comes from this not because that's a good bumper sticker or that's a pat answer but because that's the truth of the matter that's so says scripture\nAnd that that there will be something to come from this but\nThat doesn't excuse what was done they know it's ridiculous to think that there are people that have no\nSort of moral compass to understand the direction they shouldn't be going and you're not going to understand I'm Glad you don't understand that Marie ... lamb but\nSee you're looking for vengeance Marie you're looking for some sort of a\nImmediate justice but I'll tell you something and this is where humans often look to me and get frustrated\nIs that I didn't just die for your grandson I didn't just die for you I died for those guys would that gun to\n\nNow at this point they have not received that's completely obvious\n\nBut if if you think that the only people that can receive salvation or the people that are exactly like you that's not the truth\nBut now you're you're mixing academic theology with emotion none of this is this is going to make sense not to be something you really care about when you're in pain\nBecause the theology of it all is\nThat I came in I died that anyone that receives me and repentance and truly turns away from the that lifestyle that is your goal Murray you can't bring your grandson back your hope should at least be\nThat these people that did such a heinous and horrible act\nWould be converted into human beings that are worthwhile\n\nThat can be productive and giving rather than destructive and taking\n\nBut to wish on them as a normal reaction emotionally\nA reasonably you should desire that they change\nFirst and foremost so they don't do this again so that no one else will have to go through the agony or the pain that you're going through memory or\nThe family as a whole\nThat should be the goal not just vengeance scripture says vengeance is mine says God\n\nBecause it

not always fun having to cut costs shorten the like talking enjoying talking with Jay I Want to make some things [noise]\nA clear as we run out of time and and then one thing I didn't get said Jay is to um cut some slack to your family members and and trust that they're not doing this to be malicious there doing it because they think they're defending me and they're defending truth they're not doing it\nTo the harm you or any of those things they're doing it because they believe it to be true the unfortunate part is when people don't feel that they can actually come together and discuss these things because it becomes a pride issue\nThat's what I poked fun I poked fun at the\nPride of some of the fundamentals of fundamentalist communities and fundamentalism in its in its core\nIs wonderful it's\nThis is this is what we believe and we're sticking to it we're understanding and an open mind some by having an open mind for the sake of an open mind I don't understand that\nPeople say oh well you you you do closed minded why don't you know what an open mind is the same as an open mouth it's open until something of value nutritionally is placed in it and then the closest to consume in to digest\nDoesn't remain open\nFor everything there is some things you know two plus two equals four there's no need to remain open on that equation\n\nSo when I tease it's because I Know that there are those that get closed and locked in a room and do not want to think\nPast that and I don't want that here\nAnd if you get offended by that or you shut down that means that you are not receiving\n\nSometimes a people ask go well you know who do you like talking to more answering questions believers or atheists\n\nEssay was sometimes atheist because their hand is a sense essentially empty\nAny place things in it\nBut the Christian sometimes the ... it's closed and it's made into a fist and you can't get anything else in there that can help them see any differently and the church has gone through reformation and the church has gone through a lot of different things and the way it went through those things just because somebody stood up and said hey\nLook at this see this differently and you may disagree we have Catholics that lives in this program that our brothers and sisters we have Protestants it listens program that our brothers and sisters\n\nBut you have to admit that change comes from understanding and seeing things and then in newness and there's a lot to scripture\nAnd it's an amazingly beautiful book of truth and if you've got it all wrapped up\nIts not a fair assessment of the situation learn learn to gather scripture says that ah that iron sharpens iron like a man to another man to be in discussion to talk about the things that are important\nTo come together dialogue debate it's healthy to argue helpfully\nThey do these things are as productive as productive despotic rice and it makes Christians look fair and reasonable\nAnd normal not just like people who are ignorant or I'm an ... or ... teachable who wants to be around somebody on teachable\nSo please trying to remind yourself as a scripture says come let us reason together\nJesus Christ show will return in a moment to be a part of the show called seven seven holy host [noise]\nFor\nAreas [noise] sound like some certain team at camp there you don't know how you're going to feel Syrian powerful finish hearing and feed\nIt helps you feeling here I Want to help you with things that have potential that make a positive difference\nDied isn't at Cedars Sinai\nAt Cedars Sinai reaching cancer would sign\nThey're just analogous they're not truly the exact same thing so\nUm I understand is that\nThe the biggest problem with the man is it as it deals with God is that man continues to make God a bigger him\nRather than got\nSo when you try and answer more strictly attach Mike attributes to God there's always going to be a translation problem\nNow you have God that cramps deity into a a human vessel and puts it on earth for thirty three some odd years\nAnd ah there's a great purpose behind that and there's going to be some that you know here and some that you'll know later I'm a depending on where you stand with God\nBut if you were to think of it this way Mike um have you ever done any jail time\nYou ever want to know OK course not good answer now if you were to uh go to jail when you were guilty it would stink when sure but imagine going to jail if you were innocent\nWould there not be a greater a sacrifice if you were innocent and in jail versus being guilty and in jail they both have the sacrifice of not having freedom and all of that but there's an extra element\nThat if you were truly innocent like to be sitting in that jail cell cell would be a a something greater than just somebody who's guilty correct correct okay now if you take that and you extrapolate the fact that God is innocent and perfectly just\nAnd took taking on the sins of the world is the sacrifice everybody gets caught up in the death the death and the resurrection was about the payment for you that\nThat's so you have the opportunity or to a reunite and be bridged with God but the pain or what took place is something you will never understand because you can never be innocent\nNever people refer to children's being innocent children or even innocent there was never a point where you and your life ever have been truly innocent like\nI have now that the the sacrifice it's taking place you see is the physical this is the anthropomorphic language that I was talking about humans tend to look at that and go wow that's great I Would love to be able to die and then resurrect because then I could do whatever I Want it it's not that way\nIt's not like a superhero type situation this is God taking on the sins that other people did\nInto his body which is now flash\nAnd consuming that it's nothing you could ever compared to you because you're going hey it's a magic trick and that's not that's not a sacrifice Mike you give money every month\nTo your landlord whether that be\nA ... a person or whether that'd be a bank\nAnd that's a sacrifice even though you will make that money up the next month standing on your analogy you do make that money back now you don't make the same money back you make the money back because you work for it it's still going to be a sacrifice the the\nPotency of what took place won't ever be understood by man because they'll always look at it as well you got your life back no\nThat's not what took place in that sense\nThrough physically taking on an spiritually taking on the debt and the sins of the entire world\nThere is nothing that you could ever analogize nothing that you could ever compare or truly understand the loss which is why you use money as a reference or being able to get the life back\nAnd I can I jump in here absolutely um\nI mean I grew up in the Christian faith and I mean I I've heard these statements and that's and that's a very very agree button I still keep coming back to it if\nI understand the preaching but I don't understand how that anything and I explained it this way God could have looked around said okay I made all these people that I Love and they said it so they're not going to get an haven't [noise]\nUm so I Need to create this way that they can get having you know he could all powerful you could have just said I forgive you still have your free well\nNo no no no no no no no no Mike because once again you're looking for the quick way out that's a human way out in just ... well I mean there was an option\nAnd no no no but it's not a God if it Mike option it's not a God option and the reason why it's not a God option is because it's not just it just clears the plate\nThere is a balance of justice that is here that people don't understand it is the ability to sin that causes the distance God doesn't just one closeness it's not like well gosh you just want you to come home at any cost no it's that it's gotta be through this balance of justice might but I\nDie how did how did you dying do anything that's what I don't understand people say well Jesus died for me okay well what\nThe ... paid the price it made it just you couldn't just get in because ah well we'll just it's not waving a debt ceiling debt still hangs this is the human mentality the human mentality is if I gamble all my money\nAnd someone else pays for on good but in the world of truth justice that balance is still not paid because it wasn't paid by you\nSo in this particular case God takes it on and when I ask you to hang on tight uh Mike as we come across this break 'cause I Want to talk to you some more but you can't just pay for it like that it's not about wiping it clean it's that it has to be wiped clean\nJustly [noise]\nJesus Christ church will return in a moment [noise] to be a part of a show called in seven seven whole wheat
