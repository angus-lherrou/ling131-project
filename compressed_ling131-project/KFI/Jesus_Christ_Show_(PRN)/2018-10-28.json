eleven people have been shot and killed inside of Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh us attorney Scott Brady said forty six year old Robert Bowers has been arrested and charged with eleven counts of criminal homicide ... counts of aggravated assault and Thirteen counts of ethnic intimidation\nActions of Robert Bowers represent the worst of humanity we're dedicating the entire resources of my office to this federal hate crime investigation and prosecution\nHours walked into the tree of life Senegal yesterday morning and scroll hill and began shooting when police arrived he shot at them six people were shot and hurt including\nSo today all over Pennsylvania men and women in similar places of worship or in prayer for a Jewish brothers and sisters\nSo today we spent together as a community a community rejects hatred and violence a community where neighbors respect ... where we embrace our religious diversity and we celebrate our differences\nAnd together we mourn those whose lives were lost and we begin\nFeeling process I Want to commend the courageous police officers and swat teams who responded to the scene\nThey are truly heroes who without hesitation without concern for their own safety ran toward gunfire to protect innocent victims by confronting neutralizing powers they prevented additional loss of life\nSo worried about the charges last night my office filed federal charges against the defendant Robert powers\nThe complaint alleges that on Saturday October twenty seventh at approximately nine fifty am Robert powers entered the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrels hill neighborhood at that time members of the tree of life synagogue were engaged in religious services and worship\nPowers was armed with multiple weapons he had three block three fifty seven handguns and then they are Fifteen assault rifle\nInside the synagogue power shot and killed a loving individuals and wounded to others police officers and swat teams responded quickly to the scene and Bowers shot at them ultimately for police officers were injured and three of them were shot by powers\n[noise]\nDuring the course of his deadly assault on the people the synagogue Bowers made statements regarding genocide and his desire to kill Jewish people after a standoff with police powers eventually surrendered and remains in federal custody today\nSo our complaint charges powers with twenty nine separate federal crimes they're eleven counts of murder and victims who were exercising their religious beliefs their eleven counts of using a firearm to commit murder and each of these counts as punishable by death\nThe final seven counts are based upon the harm inflicted by ... hours upon the brave police officers who and trying to stop ours rampage put their own lives in danger three of these brave men were shot by powers\nSo Bowers is scheduled to make his initial appearance before federal magistrate judge on Monday October twenty ninth at one thirty PM\nSo moving forward the investigation is underway in our work will continue you know that we will spare no effort or resource in ensuring that the defendant is held fully accountable for his unspeakable and hateful crimes\nWe would ask the public and the media to have patience with us as we conduct this investigation and understand that there are things that we cannot share at times during the course of the investigation\nAt the conclusion of our of our remarks will be happy to take questions\nNow you'll hear from special agent in charge them fit Springfield ... bureau of Robert Jones\n[noise]\nThat just got last night at approximately nine PM Robert Bowers was formally taken into federal custody following their sort of an arrest warrant by federal magistrate judge here in the western district of Pennsylvania his presently still in the hospital falling surgery and under guard\nAt this point we have nothing to indicate\nThat Bowers had accomplices but again we were in the early stages of this investigation our hearts continue to go out to the families of the victims of the Jewish community here in Pittsburgh last evening after some difficult work by the medical examiner's office all eleven victims were positively identified and next of kin notification so place\nHas of six am this morning all of the victims have been taken from the education center to the medical examiner's office\nI went to personally thank the leadership of the Jewish community center and the rabbis of the free congregations located facility for their patients and the patience of the families\nAs we worked through the night to death by a can remove the victims this morning this was a large complex crime scene and much work remains to be done at president FBI evidence teams from Baltimore Washington in Newark\nOr here to augment Pittsburgh we estimate that the crime scene may take up to a week the process\nHas appointed already we've conducted a search at the subjects house in Baldwin\nAnd asserts that his vehicle will take place this morning I Can't comment on what was found in those searches we continue to conduct interviews scribes social media review possible surveillance camera video and exploit digital media to determine how and why powers committed this terrible act\nI asked again that if you have information that may help please contact law enforcement\nI'd like again thanks chief she word of the Pittsburgh Police for the heroic actions of his officers had Bowers made it out of that facility there was a strong possibility that additional violence would have occurred\nI also want to thank Wendell history and his team they are a big part of the community that all law enforcement promises to protect and serve thank you very much will turn it over when [noise]\n\nThe morning I Would just like to take a few minutes and thank the outpouring of support that we've received over the last twenty four hours\nTo Jewish community center the red cross Salvation Army the various grief counselors the children's Institute and many other organizations and businesses that provide food and logistics for for the officers and for the victims\nAs Mr Jones mentioned the area around Wilkinson shady will remain closed so that the forensic investigation of the crime scene can continue in that area will probably remain closed for up to a week\nExtra patrols had been assigned around various sensitive locations throughout the city of Pittsburgh to include where the scheduled event or courage at night\nAnd the next few minutes a medical examiner or released the names of the deceased victims\nI Would personally asked that the media respect the privacy of the families of these victims I was there last night witnessed the notifications being made to the families is a very difficult time for the families and I asked you to give them some distance\nFinally if you see a first responder whether it be a police officer paramedic or firefighter go up to them and say thank you\nFor their work that they've done the last twenty four hours has been extremely stressful for them and award a thanks would go a long way at this time I turn it over to Pittsburgh your police chief Scott Schubert who will give you an update on his officers thank you [noise]\nMorning\nA first and foremost is 'cause everybody's saying or a heartfelt\nCondolences to the victims in to their families and their friends and we have a of a strong relationship with the Jewish community in Pittsburgh and I just want to tell them that we agree with you\nWe support too and we're here few we will continue to work with you\nA this was a tragic a thing for everybody but it's something that makes Pittsburgh strong is that we work together so we're going to continue to do that uh I I still want to praise the officers for what they did a I mean they ran into danger they ran into gunfire to help others\nOr some of that training some of that experience\nBut it's their inner core wants them to help others that wants to save lives and they did that yesterday so we want to praise them for that\nUh the four officers were injured one was released yesterday or were praying one will be released today\nAnd then the other to have a little bit more that that needs to be done and can't say enough for the the medical staff at the hospitals for what they're doing for the officers or we have incredible hospitals in Pittsburgh\nAnd uh they're they're doing a fantastic job ah with that I Can't say enough for the inter agency\nInteragency support a western Pennsylvania is blessed to have so many a law enforcement agencies that worked together they train together\nUh and yesterday just showed how that works city colleagues state federal agencies working together no egos working together for what's right and uh I Can't thank them enough for that uh\nAnd just a we're going to get through this and now we're gonna continue on and show with Pittsburgh is made up so thank\nYou [noise]\nMorning I'm a doctor car waves of the medical examiner chief medical examiner of uh Allegheny county and again I Want to reiterate what everybody says so far which is weak in my office extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families I met with them last night during the process of identification and there's no words to express a\n\nThere are massive problems going on not only in the United states but in the world and it continues to come down to that that same point where people are trying to\nUnderstand each specific act rather than an overwhelming issue which is the fact\nThere are people who are not OK in the head\n\nAnd nobody wants to deal with it because a broken arm is easy you see it your ... your wrap it up and you let it\nManned\nPeople are throwing pills it's ... just for the sake of throwing pills at them in hopes of not having to deal with them\n\nAnd there will be a wave a continuous wave of people who are unstable and if you think it's just a political ideology then you have lost\n\nYou think it's just a anti Semitic rhetoric you have lost it is more than all of these things that is a manifestation\nOf what is taking place inside\nSomebody's fault the brain and twisted outlook\nAnd just like in biblical times when everybody looked for some time to put something in a in a box and put a nice bow on it and say boom we understand it their all we have to do is keep away from that I Know that it's easy it's like well it's\nThis or that or it's this or is that if we take those things away if we put them away if we make it illegal to say these things to do these things in all be gone and it won't\n\nBecause the core of the problem\n\nIs a rejection of what's right\nLook Jesus Christ show will return in a moment\nTo

well I think I Would just drop in a in a\nThere how ... how can how can those people you know how can we be safe and\nI Know that it's and it's just for the sake of time but that I realized that what took place in Pittsburgh is weighing on people heavily uh\nAnd and rightly so but even your you're looking at it as one in ten it that's still trying to make\nSense of something that's senseless you trying to look for have this if there is some ratio if there is some understanding of this than we can mathematically work it out and it's not necessarily that way\nBut it's it's not a matter of fixing every single problem it's the ... it's a matter of hearing enough\nSo um there there is a time in a place the thing that is a concern in scripture is your first Timothy six ten he Bruce thirteenth five then if you get wrapped up in the love of money there's a problem also if\nYou proverbs Thirteen eleven talks about if you're trying to get rich quick\nThere's a problem but if\nIn in those cases yes it would be a sin wherever you're going to a game and you're using at the same way you would\nA on a good meal\nOr a movie or something or then you're you're passing time enjoying the camaraderie and the conversation and the art of the game and playing\nThe game itself than no there's nothing wrong with it it's only when you get in that mindset when you start spending your\nRent money or your mortgage money or\nThings like that when you start getting into where your\nJust throwing your money away then it could be used for better things but if you're using it as entertainment and enjoyment and you're not chasing\nMoney uh then you're fine\nYou feel that there was a problem on your end\nHonestly I don't know to me is like a club going just to strengthen turn an Arctic whatever I can afford with me\nAnd that's I mean you're you're gambling and a lot of things ah you're gambling when you go see a movie whether it's going to be good or not or worse you're two hours and the money it's it's more about being lost\nAnd unstable and that when you are you're putting it on credit when your you know you're running up credit debt or things like that yes it absolutely is a sin\nBut if you have the wherewithal to go in and have enough money to sit and play and you say you know what I'm going to see how long this twenty dollars this of fifty dollars whatever it is\nTo last me and I'm gonna sit and I'm going to have conversation and banter with uh the dealers and or I'm I'm gonna sit at a slot machine and just relax and empty my head and and play a game for a while there's nothing wrong with that\n...\nYou just keep that stuff in check so that you don't get wrapped up in the case when you get wrapped up in the chase when you start you know spending money that you shouldn't be spending when you start running up debt when he started doing those things then it becomes a sin it's the difference between having a drink with dinner versus being an alcoholic\nOr drinking is not a sin being an alcoholic gives us and so you have to be honest with yourself and keep yourself in check or to make sure that you're not\nKnow I'm going nuts but there's nothing in scripture or that condemns specifically gambling betting or lottery it just says not to get wrapped up in things or\nA you know have the love of money or try to get rich quick or waste resources um those are the things that you should keep in checking if you start I'm changing or feeling a change in those things then you have to be honest with yourself and trust to family and friends are around you as well\nGlenn welcome to Jesus Christ show\nThis morning I how can I help you [noise]\nUm yeah I've got kind of a complicated situation\nI've been married for over Thirty years\nMy husband has

have a right to self defense you have a right not to be a\nMistreated and that means physically emotionally mentally I'm verbal east\nSo you have to be the decider as to what what's too much for you what's not okay\nBecause it's not is it's not as clear cut as physical violence where none of it is tolerable\nYou know there are some people that are don't articulate well or do to communicate well and and you have to decide whether this has crossed the line for you or not\nIf if it's borderline or if it's something that comes if it's obese that comes when he drinks I'm there can be ultimatums

is a lot of uh weight on the heart\nOf hearts in the minds of people right now or that it seems that the United states among other places is in turmoil\nYou have the recent story of the male ... bomber and then you have the story of eleven people killed in Pennsylvania\nA as a man stormed a Pittsburgh synagogue and open fire\n\nAnd the thought of or Jewish brothers and sisters in this neighborhood synagogue\nHad a baby naming ceremony being gunned down is beyond comprehension\n\nAnd throughout scripture\nThere is the desire even two thousand years ago the desire to make to draw a straight\nLine between these things and the reason\nTo understand them in a way where you can go okay well this is what needs to be a what we need to be rid of or this is what we need to be rid of or this rhetoric this weapon this situation this thing these ideals these ideas\n\nThat if you get rid of these things and everything will be fine and it's not true it's not true at all and people tried to make a correlation between ... between thin\nAnd illness sin in death of the innocent in scripture and it's bigger than that\nThat concept of well who send this man or his parents that he should be blind that is that is the same type of idea\nThat goes on today is people try and rationalize through something that is a rational and its very nature\n\nAnd rhetoric is in the forefront of the news it is in the center between a very boisterous\nTo be generous president of the United states and the people of the United states\n\nAnd then you get people are saying well you know this is a man who is Frank and speaks his mind and all of those things are true\n\nAnd I know that it's very popular to want to put the blame on one person especially like that as a president United States and it's not to say that there are things that could be changed\nOf him and any individual that is in power\n\nBut I Want you for just one moment whether you are supporter of his or not a supporter of his for one moment to understand this important important piece of the puzzle\n\nYou can't play tug of rope\nOnly one side it's impossible\nThe only way rhetoric is amplified the only way rhetoric becomes a too dangerous violent level is when there are two opposing sides\nClaim of nobody's helping these people\nAnd in that process you will have those that are willing in their darkness to do bad things to

can't have a tug of war with only one side\nIs important because with the out two sides the rope remains slack\nDoes that mean that you don't resist evil but you don't resist things that you think or bad or a problematic of course not but there's different tactics imagine if there was a room full of ten people and everyone is yelling at each other\nWhat that looks and sounds like ... everyone becomes a participant in the ugliness and the rhetoric\nNow imagine that none of those people are silent quiet and one is renting\n\nAnd it points out as to where the issue lies\nI get people saying so often I mean let let's be honest you go and look at Instagram or you look at Twitter right now I guarantee it's going to be filled with all these positive things or\nWe stand with this group where we stand with that group or this is heinous that people were shot or this is ... that somebody is mailing\nWhat looked to be ball like bombs to people of different views\nAnd then go next week and some through those same feeds and I guarantee the will be lighting somewhat up ripping into somebody's belief system calling them names and being ugly\nAnd then there will be something will happen in somebody go you know give peace a chance they'll quote John Lennon put a picture of John Lennon on there you'll see Martin Luther king junior you'll see these images of rape people\nBut they don't
