help you good morning to you hello\nHi I'm ... yes I Am I was calling because I was concerned that I was considering a you know this is\nA holiday it they went about Halloween Scott ... mass and then there's all the various holiday in the world and um you know if that can giving thing because people do different things and uh and I I'm steady path with a ... witnesses\nAnd um I had to fight their thing about is that really brought a light to me that that is temperate twenty fifth is that uh that it isn't there and then I think about it and think about it and I did research and things and um you\nKnow like for example a lot of these cards are greeting card or they'll fight like Mother's Day Father's Day grandparents' day secretary's day and I it in and um and uh you know in in scripture Lee I kind of take a Roman a Fifteen five\nI'm On work till the end of the of the subject but really the heart that we don't live for however well we observe it to the lord we if they're whatever day we it fair to God\nAnd that we do it and it gets faint and we shouldn't be checking our our brother that that we should get not do the things that are are blatantly um\nSo are you worried about celebrating holidays\nBecause I I I I'm not so much worried about it I personally have totally embrace it is a blessing and and and do the best you can with it and as you know 'cause everybody knew how they were you know in the Bible\nI won't tell you this there's nothing wrong with holidays are they the holy days of the past no I'm are a lot of them a ... at a bare minimum embellished by the greeting card companies absolutely but that doesn't mean that you can't celebrate a mother or someone's birth\nOr any of these things I think that uh there are some groups or some may consider them fringe groups or that or take this to a degree where they don't celebrate anything and it's a it's to me that is more militant\nAnd on Christian and the the attitude of celebrating all things I mean for the ... uh five sixteen and Eighteen rejoice always pray without ceasing give thanks and all circumstance where this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you there's\nThere's ... ... do you need a special day no but then you could say the same about the Sabbath you don't need a special day for that either it's just a matter of taking the time and\nAnd rejoicing and celebrating people and sometimes it's easier\nTo put something on the calendar or than it is because people put it off all the time\nYou do it with relationships of any kind you do it with friendships with getting together for coffee or tea or lunch or dinner or whatever it might be you put them off constantly\nAnd sometimes it's easier just to get something on the calendar and say this is the day that we're going to celebrate mothers or fathers or family or friends or whatever it might be\nAnd some of them may feel silly and you don't have to celebrate them and yes you can go back to the origins of Christmas and Easter and you can look that they weren't celebrated by the early church and of course I wasn't born in December\nUm it wouldn't make sense typically based on what was taking place during the time on my birth all those things absolutely true however there's nothing wrong with taking a time\nPutting it on the calendar and the case of things like Christmas and Easter there were pagan holidays during that time or the early church wanted to try and root those\nPagan holiday is out so that kinda plopped\nMy birth and my resurrection into those slots to try and squelch or squash the pagan a religious ceremonies or uh festivals for things like that\nAnd that was the way of the early church trying to kind of get their way I get all that but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't even matter

what form um the\nThe ... in the resurrection final fake it I\nEat but there's but there's also there's also pre cycles that are much different than Christianity by far so the and be careful not to confine them and just because there are similarities last uh last week um we talked about counter fits and there gets to be a point where\nSimilarities don't mean the same or they are counterfeit dollar bills that are very similar but I wouldn't try and pass them\nOkay but what I was saying is when God catch up ankles if they landed in Atlanta or it could be five hundred years ago\nAnd the flight ... years ago and then your kitchen culture had the exact thing that's very attack and all that energy this came back to the shows that you know that that was the wrong way of worship this is the right way to set the record straight if you would\nIf you take a map map out all the ... the timelines in which they existed and were created I'm not at all the similarities in one marker all the different different darker you can see how ...\n... it's like racial distorted\nEnded or we've fallen angels Jesus came back the record straight because we are actually a couple of days actually took our Bible of the gods and\nThere are theories are based on similar notions the problem is that uh the timeline is based on the timeline is when it becomes difficult when you're dealing with falling angels\nAnd the concept of fallen angels I talk about revelation twelve seven through nine talking about the battle with Michael in his angels fighting against the dragon or\nSatan there's no specific time\nAs a matter of fact when something's happening in heaven and that concept it's really outside of time so if you you're using that as a basis to say okay we'll started here and there are similarities no doubt similarities may point to a ... a standards through point where you have\nA belief system starting here moving through here's some parts are taken some parts of removed some some of its polluted some of it's added to what have you I get that and that has most certainly taken place but to try and trick trace it back entirely\nTo the fallen angels might be a little difficult from a historical or timeline perspective\nBut absolutely no doubt\nWith the falling of the angels and the angels coming to earth as it says in scripture says in that very scripture revelation twelve seven to nine talks about that\nHe was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him\nThat in that process that there there wasn't counterfeit and destruction and things that went along with it so I get the big picture of where you're going and how you look at it looks like you're you had a face\nAnd then how you have those those that would be motivated to destroy that face\nCausing pollution and counter fits in all these things that were twist it around and that you say that you can kind of traced that back but I think there's you're dealing with other things that are outside of the timeline\nOf history and then within the timeline of history and the post is kind of a problem to figure out is to what took place when and where man stands in in that whole equation as well\nJesus Christ church will return in a moment mean to be a part of a show called seven seven movie house [noise]\nYour own\nSome on here for someone who cares\nKFI listeners are

and all that stuff [noise] millions and millions and millions of people out swaying died number one I guess I have I think every element that crowded up there like four or five on a friday night [noise]\nAnd then number two I'm\nReading a lot of maybe I don't know George ... a special people talking but I've heard a lot on your couch why we go into a spiritual where I'm Margaret go for a learning process period of time\nI heard some say that it's up to the solar spirit\nWe want to come back and to everybody and go this whole again or we can just stay up and it says that most people prefer to come back and then they have to come back your you remember what you report\nIt all around this life right now I'm ready and I'm Don I Want to go for the scout even I don't remember\nOh your [noise] your view on both of those\nOkay first of all there's\nRoom for ten more people in heaven I'm just kidding that would be horrible you know there's plenty of room\nI haven't does not have the walls and the uh restrictions of time and space the way you think of them here there is no limitation or didn't make it in in say oh my gosh I invited all these people I didn't think they were all going to make it\nIt's not a situation like that so no worries there there is there is no a limit to where somebody will be left out that believes that\nPart is I mean there are all these people are shaped by soldiers perish just a going round and have and I know the soldiers parents like many school as far as a white horse or whatever but\nIt does not does not take up space you're applying a human restrictions and attributes of this world and the next in there is none at the time there's no time continuum there's no special concerns is not the same way in the same sense at all no\nWork their way out of six hundred billion kick ball it wouldn't matter right oh and Christ God would still be in control over all of that you\nWouldn't matter what was going on on our\nIt yet doesn't it doesn't matter doesn't there is no ah limitations there now as far as the second question and answer\nBefore you're just like coach I personally try to have a very brief pre ... third question about the practices of evangelists gift was very very high may I ask you have to answer this other question [noise]\nSure sure or ...\nOr pre being reborn not being able to remember going through let me\nPut yes back that's ... that's ...\nThat's not Christianity that say you you were quoted some versus earlier in Corinthians and uh in Hebrew is a you loosely paraphrase them about a in Corinthians about a is there to be up she from the buddies to be president lord\nBut it also says in Hebrew state your um he's appointed for men to die once and then the judgment\nSo there is no there's no place for what is referred to as to some sorrow that cycle of life there is no place for reincarnation reincarnation was never in scripture uh there's no place for it it doesn't fit\nAnd uh and and so that doesn't make sense with Christianity or\nEven though the church you know I Know so little not out there but he does have an urge to\nCape ... you'll never know so it's basically this is one toward the on that uh\nGeorge ... a lovely man a very smart man and he does have very interesting I\nGuess on coast to coast I Am a but but his his job and his focus is not the same as the\nEcho has something to show so so\n... he's looking at things from a broader spectrum then this this program is we're very focused on the Christian Judeo Christian priest opposition and the Christian theology and specific so uh we obviously have a different point in and when it comes to that so in this particular case\nThere is nothing in scripture that allows for that reincarnation and there's no need for it now there can be those that\nAre Catholic brothers and sisters argue that there is a purgatory but there's different but there's different beliefs in that that has changed throughout the years as well as to what that means and what's taking place\nUm but as far as mainstream uh Christianity or Protestantism um they differ so mainstream Christianity deeper Catholicism and Protestant in that same basket they're going to they're going to defer\nI'm Still keep in mind there's differences are very quickly so we can make sure that we're fair to everyone else you had one more question you want to do a ask\nA quick call in probably the most part we don't\nEighteen sixteen where it says suffered little children and forbidding them not to come to me for such as the kingdom of heaven and people look at that and say obviously a Christ is talking there about the children being in heaven\nUm and this is an argument that goes back and forth this is a place where really safe comes in and you have to trust that when uh the ugliness of something like a child dying takes place that a God\nA God has a way of balancing these things out that really accountability and celebration is based on acceptance or rejection\nNot ignorance and that's where the confusion sometimes lies\n[noise]\nLook price show will return in a moment to be a part of a show called seven seven holy host\nHanging\n\nOn the
