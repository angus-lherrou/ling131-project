litigation is result which to credit than that that's probably the strongest argument versus confronting the question of whether the essence he acted lawfully per se but\nYou have to see scrapped net neutrality rules earlier this year those from the Obama administration the commission has been sued by several states and open Internet groups trying to keep net neutrality in place Amtrak has rode out the first of its new fleet of electric diesel locomotive\nAstrologer engine is the first the fourteen locomotives little push and pull people up and down the surf liner Rob between San Diego and

even ten mile Sunday thanks\nVery far [laughter] but because normally normally they're short ... it's a short hop type engagement right or yeah yeah ... okay\nSo that's a long way so what does it happen ... what happens when you try to take a little farther like that\nWell you run out of battery so if you're really dedicated to taking the birds all the way which I have been uh you gotta switch up but you gotta you gotta take on as far as it'll take you and then when it runs out he\nGot to scour around for another one and the map on your phone shows you where they are\nOh that's what I was going I was going to ask you about that so you can tell where you need to go to get the next one\nYeah supposedly although the problem is quite often they're phantom bart's so you'll walk half a mile or something to find one and either somebody will get their right before you I've seen people run up asked me to grab on\nWhat I can get it [laughter]\nOr or they just won't even be there at all because I think people bringing things into their houses or they you know knock off the trend spotter or whatever so there's ... ...\nI see I see I mean they are they are they stole and a lot of the time it doesn't seem so I see them all over the place\nI mean I've heard horror stories you know of all sorts of a bird mistreatment happening but yeah I mean I it seems like it's going pretty well I mean there's bird and there's a line scooters and now there's a I think lift scooters so it's definitely a thing\nYou have them all or is are are you a bird men\nOr math or I'm a I'm a bird enthusiasts\nWhy why why bird you dislike about company\n[noise] yeah I don't mind one is it seem a little ... here and it's more of a pain to use the app a bird is just like cooler the cool and\nI see and so do you and like your other how old are you thirty three\n... do you and other people your age like a hang out a like would you have your bird sessions like\nWhere you're going to you know I've I've romanticized into my mind about it just like a bird gang [laughter] exactly I Know that that's just me kind of trying to I sometimes do that I Try to kind of create a world where ah I imagine you all enjoying each other with the bird scooters taking you to the coast or something that was that\nI was at a birthday party or the other day and the whole premise was drunk bird to the ocean so it was like a party in Brentwood and it was like I was once for all\nKind of kind of a tip see we go and you know burned\nTo the ocean [laughter] that I don't endorse okay I just really Akron now you're right yeah but not say well I Wish\nYou a happy birding Isaac I thank you for taking us through it I I it sounds to me like for most short hops the birds are fine they're going to be able to\nDo do sufficient battery in power to get to the next location but if you are looking for any kind of distance the way you do occasionally yeah then you\nKnow I yes I think that's absolutely right there are there are a last mile solution right that the whole thing and you know you you can't get the or from public transportation to your play it's a it's a kind of that last mile will get you there\nOh that's very cool yeah you're right so it it does make public transport a lot more accessible for for a lot of people\nOh yeah totally and I don't for me too yeah\nFor if you don't need to wear a helmet now is that one of the things that they they're not forcing you to do that right\nNow for a few I mean you probably should I don't but uh you know I think it would be smart to\nYeah okay uh Isaac Simpson happy burning thank you thank you yeah\nWe should bring us up to speed so to speak the uh uh I I I actually make ... going in a travelogue a mile or two with it seems like it could be

EJ Gilbert I said a and I don't know because it says EJ and I thought it was at a DJ Hubbard\nIs with us you see your past networks of former ... FBI cybercrime as an agent\nAnd he is just the guy to be talking to about this hey Jay how're you doing All right so I I\nWant to leave some time to talk about what's going on in California with not neutrality that kind of thing but first we're talking about this this Facebook thing about how bad is it what could have been compromised what might have been a big taken those who did compromise it and where is that information now\nWow I'm how bad it well you know like you said it was Fifteen million people but they actually walked out Ninety million now granted that Facebook has a billion it's you know that that that may not seem like a lot but the uh what ended up happening is there was a very simple\nWell known old style attack that was done against the system\nAnd what it is it's called the session i._d. so it made it allow somebody else to act as if they were you and therefore they could see and do everything you can do one Facebook so you think you got that that ban or no notice which means that you're automatically logged off\nAnd you had to walk back and and put it in a new password and everything about nature right do anytime you log on to Facebook anything you can see\nThese other individuals could see two so whatever information was there for you is what they could see so all your friends all your life all your posts all the things you got rid of all your private messages to your various different friends around the world that you didn't make public all of that was visible to them and um\nThey uh they're at the point where they're like well we don't know if anybody's really youth is we're not seeing anything but there was a a a a article out of New York today about um\nOver in ... in the u._k. where they started seeing people selling this stuff on line for like two bucks for three dollars a a logging whether or not that's directly linked to this or not is unknown but um\nThis is happening all the time where where they're trying to compromise Facebook I mean there there are hackers working around the clock I mean you know it's a it's a sort of a\nThat's a Hackney prices around the clock but they really are like at all hours of the day all around the world there are hackers working to try to get into a lot of different systems Facebook stirs one of them how did they get access to this I mean I I mean it it does using Facebook one of those things that feels pretty ironclad\n[noise] you'd like to think it should be at this point in time given all the bad press they've had and all the information that you know sold or or shared or whatever it may be let me address first what you said about the hack are working around the clock the idea of the corporate hackers sitting around and mom and dad they spent or something you know dark

comment was Yom ... sitting at the gym Timothy Martin night\nThere were ... should have vendor in Timbuktu down to the listener appreciation meet and greets downtown the red cross event Sharon's there and ... as well Joey ... won with this and\nVery happy to have EJ over here he's the CEO of past network he's a former FBI cybercrime as an agent and we're talking about the Facebook\nHacking which compromise fifty million accounts and now some of those accounts and a lot of information and data on those accounts is up for sale on the dark Web they say that some of them still showing for about two dollars a pop on the dark Web what's the dark Web EJ\n[laughter] the dark Web ... it's a great scary term isn't it I'm really the dark Web is just an area of the of the Internet that's not index like or things like being or Google or Yahoo or any of the major search engine so um\nSo it doesn't mean that your Facebook account is being used to score drugs or some sex crime on this dark Web play which\nWell no it doesn't mean that but if if I were to take over your account and I didn't want to say who I really was and I want to communicate I'd gladly use your account to do those types of things so I could um the dark Web ... is just a low key it's an underground\nIt's an area that's not index people not everybody knows where to go but if you know where to go you can buy pretty much anything\nSo what should you do just to put a button on the Facebook thing is there anything we can do I mean besides degree just change your password and hope\nActually though than the number one thing you should do beside changing your password is to go in and make sure everything's logged off\nUm we have everything log in through Facebook nowadays you've got all kinds of apps and your phone plug in your home computers look and sound like you're you're very different games you're my player all logging sewing and log 'em out a log 'em out make sure you don't really need them there's a whole setting in their Facebook put it up on the on their various different blogs\nThere's plenty of news are articles out there but you don't need Angry Birds walking him through Facebook you don't need you know um\nWhether or not your trip advisor is going through Facebook right now those are the things you should walk out because like I said before if they get into the account they can see everything you can see via Facebook so if you wind up your bank account through Facebook they can see it\nYeah and a lot of us do when you're offered that do you want to just log in through Facebook you go yeah why not I mean I don't want to happen to create another username and password um so that's great advice okay so we will do that no\nOne of the things that's going on in California is that California has pushed back from the federal government they are ending net neutrality the beds are\nIn that neck neutrality means that uh everything comes in at the same rate when you go on the Internet\nSo when ending that means that things are going to come in at different speeds based on how much potentially you're paying for them\nAnd how it's that's that's really the essence of it uh yeah Michael should pay asked a really good question and it was what would that look like what's that going to look like if she was the end users ones net neutrality and if it does here in California\nWhen it formerly in so many ... from a government perspective from a federal government perspective it's supposed to be and by by the spring of this year and that what that means is that any\nUh Internet service provider can\nToronto back or slow down traffic unless of course you'll pay more now normally that would be like charging say Netflix more or give me more or one of the what's called the content delivery network ... charging them or or you as a consumer could pay more\nUm what is going to look like is a is a really weird situation there's nobody knows the law is supposed to say that if\nTime Warner decides to go ahead and throttle back Netflix they've got to notify net flicks that they're doing this and then of course hey you can pay extra let you through a\nWhole disclosure the company that I run path network we actually address this problem is is exactly what we look at we look and can tell you when a company has actually traveling you back why they're riding your traffic in a weird way of things of that nature as a as a ... to to address these issues because it's pretty clear\nThe feds are going to say no more net neutrality California saying\nHey we're keeping net neutrality and this is going to be a battle in the courts for for the next few months\nWe are talking to you Jay Hoeber to use the CEO of past network and he's a former FBI cybercrime as as you as a former director of security important for my space and box interactive so we really knows his way around all of this stuff\nWe should be rooting for a neutral ... for net neutrality to hold up you're in California shouldn't we\nPlay the other argument here do you think everybody should be able to get on the Internet yeah so should then the Internet being something\nLike a utility where you can have water and electricity and all of that at your home\nOr I see where you're going with this by soldiers and called the utility [laughter]\nSo if it ... this this is the argument against that neutrality if it becomes a utility and\nThen it's not there's not a profit the the argument is there's no reason for the highest fees are the groups that ... that all those ISPs to innovate better to make it bigger and stronger and you have horizon coming out with their five gee network and so on [noise]\nSo for the utility and everybody's saying then why should we really pushed to make it any better we just create the fame pipes everybody you know everything flows through something breaks oh well we found out the water from an eventually gets fix back up\nSo you got to decide which side you're leaving a I'm I'm In favor of that there should be that neutrality um it's it's a\nEverything is done on the Internet at this point in time um and then there was no way to throttle people back as we saw during the fires horizon Prado back the firefighters communication because they didn't pay enough um you you just can't there's gotta be a happy medium somewhere but I don't see what that is at this point in time\nYeah yeah it doesn't it doesn't seem to make any sense to get rid of him but but the feds want to get rid of it and they're going to get rid of it for a lot of the country will see of California can hold the line how do you handicap that\n[noise] oh ah there's got to be some balance in between there um\nAre you what are you here\n[laughter] what do I hear I hear the net neutrality is actually going to stay in place to be honest with you uh there's going to be instead of it being net neutrality the reverse meaning\nWe're we're we're going to end up doing is having a baseline net neutrality is going to say everybody got this kind of communication level call it a hundred make if it's affecting or whatever it may or fifty megabits per second if you want something better then you have to pay more so I think this has got to turn itself on its head in California is going to push it into that into that world\nWell great great way to end it thanks for all the Facebook update thanks for that for another tragedy EJ he'll burn the yellow path network former FBI cyber crimes agent I feel smarter\nThanks CJ thank you guys today if I Am six\nForty

saying yeah OK\nIt might have been more than that I bought a bunch of stuff and I can't remember I mean I'm really trying to throw all of these different CBD offerings ... these are issues at ... and it really does work\nBut uh somebody else was explaining that ooh the THC you were asking where it comes in you know\nIn the land of it or not or I mean if you're smoking at are you getting the benefits or not\nThey say that I'm a THC is only present in the female cannabis plants that I forgot about that one the producers ... residents flowers when\nWhen people are when your average um you know your average Joe on smoking\nMarijuana [laughter] to say for like ...\nOut is that they're you know any person who doesn't smoke\nMarijuana but they're also there's many THC in a small amount of CBD they're getting both small amount of ... right so what they what they figured out how to do you think science is had extracted this one percent amount of CBD that you're getting out of a normal dosage of marijuana\nAnd they're just you know producing that one percent now on that\nI see yeah yeah and so that would be familiar but that's not the way it [laughter] I've seen I've seen jars maybe like three ounce\nA jar of lotion go for you know forty fifty sixty dollars yeah no it's exposure to the difference between medication that works in something that doesn't and they're going to kill your liver or whatever if you were saying oh yeah ...

it than I think you know the munchies kick in and all that but even that they've been able to dial in there's a there's some additional thing somebody will be able to tell me what this shows there's an additional she read the THC and then there's one additional thing\nThat is in some of these mixtures and that kills the munchies that\nAre normally crop up so they've really come a long way through and they're just getting started with this stuff yeah ah that's\nMore than you ever need to know or it's just an appetizer for you guys can go do the investigation after that on your own\nA shark attack but there is good news at the end of it all or at least the best that could be expected will get in to that and more next hour mark Thompson airport Tim Conway junior KFI am six boarding\nBeing in fact it would bring a brainy eating amoeba you saw this\nHe was infected by this brain eating uh maybe it's a rare infection you'll be glad to know thank goodness it's contract it through the nose in freshwater this guy's only twenty nine years old\nAnd he was mowing his lawn when he felt ill from a headache\nHis symptoms worsened he was taking the hospital after he got incoherent who was unable to put together a coherent speech\nPattern a spinal tap is what revealed that he was infected with this ... and many died on September twenty first it's the first confirmed case of this infection in the United states in twenty sixteen\nHe felt ill he visited this\nCable park and surfers short it's a water park\nAnd he said uh I guess\nHe went there and she this woman who was a spokesperson for the county public health district there in Waco, Texas for this all happened she said in a telephone interview that they send epidemiologist to take samples from the park to test for the presence of this brain eating a me but this is the Centers for Disease Control did that\nThose results are going to come in this week no reports of any other illnesses\nAnd this is a you know the ... are you studying in high school that single celled organism I mean you know we've all seen them through microscopes but apparently it can cause a rare infection of the brain\nAnd it's generally fatal yeah it is scary because again this guy wasn't involved in some some sort of a high risk activity and\nWe're just going to take a dip in this nice fresh water body of water\nIt thrives in warm temperatures is commonly found in a warm bodies are fresh water lakes rivers in hot springs\nAnd according to the CDC it can also be in soil enters the body again through the nose and it moves on to the brain\nThey say it typically occurs when people go swimming in lakes and rivers\nAre it turns to the brain as a food source according to this information to the CDC but a hotline fiction I Know you're everybody's saying oh no I'm never going to go out and do know and now let me just the number of people who have died from it\nAccording to again to the CDC in the United states\nA hundred and forty three infections total between Nineteen sixty two and twenty Seventeen\nAll four of them all but four of them are fatal but that's not a lot on during the forty three between Nineteen sixty two and twenty Seventeen\nA and again\nThey say you want to avoid it hold your nose or use nose clips that's what they say avoid putting your head underwater such as in hot springs and stirring up the dirt or the mud in those places there you go in and lastly\nSomeone asks is nasal rinsing save it depends\nLike nutty pots and thing yeah exactly\nAt least one person contract to the infection through

you ah go camping or hiking that to purify water yeah that would kill that little\nPlug yeah that's a great point I Would think some kind of like you you know in a water park\nYou're not going to have that stuff right right for a fact I was at a water park ... had dropped the whole the you know it's ...\nIt's really not it's it's not that people are you know ingesting it in any way it's that people
