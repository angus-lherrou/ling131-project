to\nSay look at you know\nGoing hey so what are you working on now you're making people's lives miserable little more than they were yesterday right uh yeah in the day before right oh that's cool\nI'm Stuart tonight eleven o'clock a hidden camera investigation on\nUh LA county animal control officers or you know there there's tens of thousands of unlicensed dogs and cats\nIn the county running around these are men and women are officers are supposed to go out a check on to see if uh animals are licensed to get people to license them to a rabies shots\nOf the money for the licenses used for the shelters um and we found a number of these officers are for hours at a time of doing anything\nAbout their usual are hidden\nCameras caught them at the gym at homeless sleeping for hours at a time you know we've got some great video these guys and what particularly wanted the guy does uh we watched him day in and day out\nUm and uh for hours at a time and of course we get the documentation after the fact in shows that uh they claim they went to\nSeventy eighty Ninety different addresses 'em to check on animals that they work their full day of our cameras show uh that didn't happen\nHey David how long you been with Kay Keller CBS [noise] twenty nine years\nWow congratulations man I think if there are even after\nTwenty nine years\nLet's say you're working on a story right and your boss says hey we're worried or they can use in all your uh chasing some uh you\nKnow a animal ah I you know cops around\nAny and they found out you were actually at home sleeping all day and then you went to the gym how many of those could you stand before you get fired [laughter]\nProbably one by one maybe two right but but it seems like working\nIn the public sector working for the government did that you can withstand hundreds of those\nOf course of course I mean did you see 'em a couple of weeks ago the the ethics commission came down on the guy the port city parking manager who we caught a year and a half ago he was parking all his his own cars in the underground parking 'cause they didn't have parking at his house\nAnd allegedly went on for years wow and we did that story I don't know a year and a half ago or something they finally went to the ethics commission they find them like ten thousand dollars a couple of weeks ago I'm\nUsing some job I work job wasn't demoted ... parking management one\nI worked on uh the the same company worked for for CBS for well over a Ninety seven point one the up and talk station and there was a guy who called in sick uh one night right he was a I think he was a there was a board up and he called in sick one night\nAnd then he posted pictures of him at a restaurant in marina del Rey on social media lush\nYeah and he got fired the next morning right\nAnd and it wasn't even they just said you know are these you were these pictures taken last night and he said yeah I'm Sorry and they said OK pack up your stuff and and he moved on\nRight right but that's the way it should be\n... yeah I mean give some leniency depending on how good an employer hello I get it or whatever but no you're not the outright\nLying about where you were yeah you can't tolerate that because that will expand into other areas of your employment\nBut a lot of it here too goes toward supervision and and we got the records of these guys are said they did for a given day\nNo one check up on it because if they did they would have found out that he wasn't at one two three main street\nWhere he said he was a ... and\nNo one checks up on it it's sort of the same when we did the story a few years ago on the auto cruise don't go around and and a foot an eight hour day they go to breakfast that go to lunch and they feel three potholes but nobody ever said at the end of the day Hey Joe\nPotholes in one day I why don't why nobody ever says it\nSo I mean I guess the psyche works that way and says the supervisors not going to say anything to me I might as well fill three bottles instead\nOf sharing well look I'm I'm David Goldston by the way as well as a heavy on channel two nine eleven o'clock with his big a big piece about these animal control um you know I ... officers who are not doing their job but my two things one is um I I think even if you're in the public sector\nYou work for the government the county to stay to or the city I think they look for people to to to hire one of the qualities is you don't bust my ... I'm not going to bust yours yeah\nI I think that that that some of the mindset is and I think getting back to what I was just saying that the supervisor may not get about that 'cause a supervisor doesn't want to be watched and all of a sudden he or she is coming down and somebody\nThen somebody's going to come down on them and that's exactly right I\nI don't know what's going on I get my pay and I go home\nThat's exactly right but we all suffer because uh you know those jobs are ultimately should be done properly to make all of our lives easier and make the city better and property values go up and it's cleaner and it's safer in the whole run\nThat's why the association of Orange County deputy sheriff all of Orange County law enforcement and hundreds of others probably support Don barns for sheriff and Tony ... caucus for district attorney\nPlease vote by mail in early voting for at the polls for Don Barnes and Tony ... to exceptional public servants who will work for us all and make orange county's safer [noise]\nPaid for by association of Orange County deputy sheriff independent expenditure committee this advertisement was authorized by Penn State or committee controlled by candidate\nYou but I didn't think of ...
