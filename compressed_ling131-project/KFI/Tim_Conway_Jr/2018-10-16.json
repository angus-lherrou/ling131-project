All right let's say regroup here anyway I think we might want to move off the story Bill Gates reportedly asked Allen\nTo give him some of his shares to compensate for the higher amount of work being performed by gates after he left the company but according to Alan\nGates said he did almost everything on basic and that was the the the first originally their their first operating system and the company should be split sixty forty in his favor Allen agreed to that arrangement\nWhich gates later attempted to amend sixty four thirty six but Gates' tried to buy Allen out for five dollars a share\nOver Allen refused and left the company with their shares intact\nSo that proved to be very critical for Alan becoming a billionaire after Microsoft went public so Bill Gates tried to a grab all of its shares\nAnd Paul Allen said no dice ma'am I'm holding on to these suckers so that's how I became a billionaire if he would have sold them all at\nFive bucks a share to Bill Gates he would have been you know worth maybe thirty forty fifty million dollars like all the other you know trucks in this world but that is wild that's how I became a billionaire and he died worth twenty point two billion\nDollars\nA lot of people could make the argument that you know I'm that this guy had cancer Paul Allen right and he's trying to fight cancer well Bill Gates is always is also sticking his hand in his pocket trying to take out his biggest shares for men\nThat sort of odd I something a friend would do like for instance God Forbid\nYou know somebody you knew got sick and you were in business with them would you try to grab all their shares in them while they're trying to uh you know remain alive and trying to beat some kind of rare you know fatal disease\nI don't think you would but maybe there's an explanation from Bill Gates on why he did that I Can't think of one but there is what the hell I there was a sky diving accident a bad vibes\nMa'am a woman jumped out of a plane and our parachute did not deploy properly\nOkay here's the deal you're a freelancer higher than self made cell phone business someone\nWhether you were contractors creative director or consultant you're the boss and that makes things easier and less of course you're trying to get a mortgage when it comes to qualifying for cash out ... ... workers come with more obstacles more complexities and more stress right\nDial a three three four four to cash and one of our cache of mortgage specialist will help you qualify for the lowest interest smallpox\nRegardless of your source of income is the easiest coal you'll make fall day three three four four to cash make the cast calls today\nFor markets in fact mortgage grew CD a Casco markets Ninety five hundred you every road for California Ninety One two and then my last one to a two three one people housing lender not license and all the New York five five six five seven nine nine one zero for licensing terms and restrict again that's three three four four to cash McCaskill today\nWas almost ...
