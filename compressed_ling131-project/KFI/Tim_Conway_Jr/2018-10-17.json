women\nWho were at their home and they left about nine o'clock at night to go to some event and that's when Jonathan Jose ... allegedly entered the home and uh\nHe ransacked their bedrooms he entered to some sort of a window and I guess he was watching these women he must have known about them I don't know if he followed them are found them on social media but somehow you know saw that they were leaving the house that night and decided my chance to go in\nAnd he started scattering their undergarments around the home I guess it's their underwear and their ... and then he was using one of the victims laptops to download images of her as he broke into that too he\nWas checking out porn sites and then uh\nAnd then uh yeah he left his fluid\nOn the computer and left some of it in another victims bedroom oh plus he raised the refrigerator and having some some milk and cookies you left the container on the counter but it was the evidence that they found all over the laptop\nThat led to his arrest\nOr the Orange County da's\nRapid DNA program\nThe program match DNA samples to release who was already in the system for a sentence he received back in twenty Seventeen on misdemeanor case so he does face up to six years in eight months in state prison if convicted he's also accused of being in possession of multiple items from the women including two pairs of underwear\nSo they caught
