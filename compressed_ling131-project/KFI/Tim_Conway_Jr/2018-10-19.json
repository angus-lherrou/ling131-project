tell us when they got\nThis on the ballot and they were trying to get it passed and they did with all the lies they tell oh don't worry you know serious violence person's coming out of prison so if you're a three striker\nAnd you're considered gun violence that probably the most significant most certainly means your third strike\nWas quote non violent which may be the case for like a petty theft but it may not be the case and we talked about this back then there's a whole list of very nasty felonies including rape of an unconscious person\nSome other things dealing with terroristic threats
