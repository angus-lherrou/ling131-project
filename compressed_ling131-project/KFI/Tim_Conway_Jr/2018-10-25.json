they need a guy on this I'm I'm\nI'm there do um but you know what I think\nThe inexperienced that I bring to the table will help\nYou know because they all look through it they all have these you know these these blinders on because they've had so many ... yeah exactly they've had so many years of experience on how to track these guys down\nThey need a guy in there to just or to spit ball and noodle some new ideas and I think that's me so I'm Serious that the FBI needs me to come down there you can pick me up here at thirty four hundred I'll live and I'll uh I'll be on the corner with my FBI jacket\nHosting it calmly she'll poll should Tim helped the FBI noodles [laughter]\nI think I seriously think I could help the fellows out and the gals right it's a twenty eight to 'em anyway it is interesting though that everybody has a theory on\nThis you know I I I'm I text out a couple of buddies are today I said hey are you doing this and right and and I I I said it's about Fifteen people right\nHey you know this is a a you know say this crap around and all of them you know said you know\nNo or you know of course by what I Do that you know and and so it made a you know crazy comments and only one person said oh you can joke about that because I had signed a joke I just ask if you did it did and then when the guy said I you know do you can joke about my job back\nI may have done it I uh maybe on to something here maybe it's somebody in in a you know in Los Angeles or who's listening right now\nAnd he's all worked out he or she and they're all worked out because they're watching the news and they're probably getting very excited that's all this stuff is going on than they did it and you know the reading newspapers and articles about it\nAnd they're trying to keep it from friends and family and they're getting very excited that all the emotions going on and yet\nParanoia is going to start to set in because whoever did this they're going to realize that there soon going to be watched\nAnd Everytime they look out their door walk out the door they're going to look around to see if the homeless guy in the front porch who's off a you know on the up half a block\nAway is really an FBI agent and the guy the ice cream and coming up the street is really a local cop dressed as an ice cream man and that kind of paranoia is going to start to destroy this\nPerson so like the the idea of like a an unmarked boxes in just a picture of a radio on I don't think it's unloaded a Styrofoam antenna on top yep\nOr you know um maybe it's a ... truck you know\nAre stepping up all is Stephanie no\nJak Stephanopoulos jak Stefan of itch and then I Love at the end you were in the white pages and it's pretty good to be in the white pages anyway so I think that paranoia is going to start to eat this man a way it's going to start to eat is sold the way that he did this\nAnd he's going to get too paranoid make a mistake and I guarantee you\nThat in the next week or so the FBI is going to drag some crazy right out of their apartment and in front of everybody and say this is the guy is the guy who did it\nBut everybody has a theory on on what happened
