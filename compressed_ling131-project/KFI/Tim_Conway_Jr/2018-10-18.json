start training\nYou know I I basically training year round you know it's it's a lifestyle but ah for fight by camps usually lasts for me is about twelve weeks I I like to\nAs soon as I say announce for me I kind of just buried down and go into hibernation mode which is just focus on the fight that's it nothing everything has an intimate training my sleep to my nutrition to my recovery it's about twelve weeks juvenile\nAnd twelve weeks or how many hours a day\nOr upwards of six hours a day that's why we get a lot sometimes have to take you know a few days off by to regenerate and he'll if I if I get injured or if I'm kinda\nOver trained myself write about a good you know happy medium of high and low days you know the sports so new that the training is kinda is changing and plus the new technology is coming out\nUh so it's kinda you know just a lot of fires are over training to go into a fight 'cause you had to be\nBest conditioning shape for boxing for wrestling for verbiage joy I really you know it and those are different you know cardio systems that you're working you know wow I'm so you just got to come we'll welfare well condition and just a sharp on on friday night\nWhen you have like a rough fights you know where you know you got a you know it's gone on a you know round after round and you do feel like you know he either injured you work out the best of your you know you orange or does it take a long time to recover after fights\n... luckily for me I haven't had you know to lengthy of layoffs these last few fights I injured my hands that's what's kind of sent me back a little bit is is from fighting you know\nAre continuously is the head injuries but that was the fights you know a ton of money and if I have it you know I got a guy stitches in and then some of the sites I had to you know\nHe'll that and then he was the longest you know I had five twenty five minutes for when I fought dominant crews and as long vice I totally need had to have the operation the knee and all that oil and then come back so yeah sometimes it it's it's hard it's it's it after the fight you know you hope that you win the fight if ... ... you lose kind of\nLike a dog why it's now you know kicking the horse why it's down\nYeah but the U.S see the the the persons have gotten much much bigger over the years\nYeah it's a the fastest global go we're growing sport in the world and um you\nKnow I think that's that's great you have a lot of the endorsements coming in you have you know the pay is getting better that there's more and may fighters that are becoming super stars are are stars and that can\nDo pay per view draws and that's what makes you most mainly become champion you can draw or pay for you and that's when you're going to get the most money so it's incentive to go out there and and shown each every time and and do your does your fan base so you get paid that money\nOur core Garber end is whether it's number one ranked UFC Bannon wait a contender and so when when you're fighting a guy like see I could never get into the game even though I'm billed as a boxer as you can see 'em at as a fighter naturally I can never get the game because I Would be to

in the face you get past ah not not necessarily an audio yeah drives me crazy I think that rhyme in or they're\nFighting emotionally in a\nEmotions or someone motions are good if you'll see like adrenaline is a good a motion to have you know or you know when you're doing your good in the fight you know you just keep picking a few feet off at a notion if you hit them hard and you hear the crowd go oh yeah let's see if you feed off ... especially when you're tier their change your name they keep going\nDid your parents try to talk you out of fighting\nOh yeah my mom and she wasn't a big

I I watched every single round every every punch you through ... a child and I and I I enjoyed it I really did it was a big part of growing up\nThank you yeah and that but now it sounds like you're really enjoying life now you know you you don't have to train anymore you know they get back in the ring with these idiots you know\nYou really enjoying it I'm I'm a hundred percent you absolutely right does it did you ever did you enjoy enjoy the the hype like you live in Vegas now right yeah so when you drive\nDown the strip you remember the big night absolutely you know and the millions of people who were watching I mean that was a you know what an adrenaline you know but I mean you know like for me I'm adrenalin junky anyway by\nDriving down the strip and seeing your picture on every billboard and and everybody that shows up in the town is looking at you that it's it's gotta be you know the greatest feeling in the world that was pretty cool back then then um but uh you got 'em\nNow you're training it was ... by the way when you fought other guys I and you know in in the in the list is endless\nDid you did you hate them no then hate though you didn't because he I Would hate that without the hate them to get in the room with them a hate them and to find a job [laughter] I\nI guess there's a difference right oh difference I listen to\n'em but now you're now you have a

most of fighting and not at all maybe after the bite huh one find that there's got to qualify for it really they drug tested you and you got the ... who is yeah\nWow ... ... ... oh that's horrible that's nice yeah what can you do\nBut I imagine after a fight though you know some of the fight fight you knock this guy out in the first ... first round\nYeah but I live I shouldn't smoke for doing that could be fired [laughter]\nForty for your fights ended in a knockout\nYeah we're not to do it out\nBut after a fight I imagine if that went on you know eight nine ten rounds a you know you're probably ... probably you know for a couple of days that you were really bad but you guys always had a lot of pressure to go out that night\nTo the club and ah you know to really get things rolling you must have a massive headache when you went out\nNo way I never party before a fight\nAbout afterwards after the event of all afterwards is unbelievable I mean they probably put you up in the presidential sweet or whatever it was him and I have some girls um and it was really who yeah and that's when you were in now you are single at the time too yeah and so I mean look everybody knows I mean do you have the uh you know the greatest\nOnce the fight was over did you ever think while you're fighting\nGeez I Can't wait to get through this because I had to go up the president knows we
