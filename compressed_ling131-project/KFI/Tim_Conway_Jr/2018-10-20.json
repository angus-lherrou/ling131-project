out in Milwaukee interest that he's out your way in bender coming up next the of money that will be back KFI is exporting\nGo every but everybody knows that everybody but you got to watch out for that now yes he liked\nThat that was the first thing that the pilots that when we did the briefing with just the pilot this morning was\nHey there's a lot of traffic so when we take off we go straight up and when we land we come almost straight down so don't you know don't be afraid it's not a thing it's we do it in war war time all the time it's just a little unusual to do it over a ... you know south LA county\nSo when you took off ... was from the air shows going on more on Sunday down in Huntington Beach when you took off was nearly vertical\nWell no it was vertical\nWow man some power to take that I that that on the edge and to and to throw it vertical increasing speed while you're doing that it's got to be unbelievable\nIt's it's an indescribable feeling I mean roller coaster addicts love that feeling of being pushed back in your seat\nBut the the and that's not even the highest gee maneuver that we did taking off like that and doing that vertical shot straight off the end of the runway he says only about four or five jeez\nWow I'm so it's a good first taste of what is to come because we did everything from Iran roles which is where you're going straight and you just basically do the the airplanes spins on a taxi that's it [noise]\nUm and then I got to do one of those because I said hey wait a minute I didn't I pay for this plane she doesn't get on the run this thing\nI mean look and you have an even F. sixteen has been around a while I mean jumping into like an F thirty five or an F. twenty two and these those are the you know the next generation those even more powerful\nYeah and and that's a terrifying thing I mean when you think about how much the worst comes out of that single engine and an F. sixteen and then you you know you ramp that up to some of the other planes that have two engines go on at the same\nTime yeah it's it's unbelievable how powerful these things are\nAnd how long was the flight once you got out to the desert floor around for a while\nI'm probably total air time was about forty minutes um because after we did our stuff\nOut in the desert including loops and uh the nine gee turn a which was that causes I came to blacking out\nWe came back we buzz Huntington Beach we actually did a couple of passes right in front of the beach there there is sort of in between uh other aircraft on tease everybody before the falcons came up before the thunderbirds came for their full performance\nAnd then did a little spin move and then down onto the ground so from from the time I sat in the plane to the time I got out of the plane was just a little bit more than an hour\nDid you tip your pilot out\nWho you know I wasn't sure how to do that\nI'm I'm fifty or the answer is no since you're on the air with us we're going to do a quick whip around a you want to play ... okay and it's so what do you guys call it on your show\nUm I don't know what you mean but if you're talking about a similar area where we used things with the

will win more money\nSo he says All right and I said give me the the three numbers you play and he said okay ah ten Thirteen\nSixty three ... and I said you gotta be kidding me what those are the
