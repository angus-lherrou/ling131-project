your brain forget the bad times and we remember the good times\nIs that right yeah so I Know it seemed to work that way is\nRight when you're in college and you know that you've got to be a big test coming up whatever you have a couple of beers I\nForget the bad stuff that's right a Yahoo is paying fifty million dollars to data breach victims everybody gets a hundred bucks but the lawyers get thirty five million seems wrong and Americans are increasing their spending on Halloween to two point five billion dollars\nThe candy in constant unbelievable you dress up a once in a while I Do yeah once in a while but I'm I'm really a sort of a low key\nFollowing guy to dress up as someone said well you'll be here on Halloween right I'll tell you a quick\nStory though I was when I was Fifteen you know what's going on my buddy used to have you know for Halloween we're all gonna be a windshield doughnuts so I pulled the windshield don't it's I'm I'm dressed in drag that was my costume that you must have been lovely so I look in wind chills and none of the other guys are dry land all shirts and jeans\nSo I said to my dad you got to give me home I got to get out of this crap so I go back ten minutes later and I miss having a donut the guy goes hey you worry I line\nOr a mix I tell you it's got scammed five or six forty\nListens to KFI pocket a cool grand that is a lot of LA marketing their next chance to win happens within twenty minutes\nOkay by the Los Angeles Orange County and I heard a radio station [noise] fancy home to home let\n'em receiver they're alive and they can find plenty for our newsroom more than a hundred homeless people from South LA have upgraded from tense just fancy apartment complex for homeless people has a hundred sixty apartment where it's like he says he's been living on a sidewalk for a couple of years\nI was like I'm I was like oh my God this is old man you know to me\nUnless people who've moved in didn't have to pay for furniture TVs or microwaves any residents are supposed to spend thirty percent of their income on right\nLA police say a package center the office had Senator Dianne Feinstein in West LA was not a threat to the bomb squad was sent out yesterday to check the package the LAPD says it contained nothing dangerous and wasn't no way connected to the devices sense to other high profile Democrats\nA woman in San Bernardino county will get more than fifty thousand dollars for spending an hour and a half which I\nA lawsuit claims the woman was held by sheriff's deputies an ice agents ACLU attorney Adriana Wong says they arrested her even though she told them she was a U.S citizen she had her driver's license on her she had plenty of proof that she was who she said she was one says bill they put her in handcuffs and took her to an ice holding facility and they kind of laughed\nBecause that is I mean look they raise the taxes here without asking us without a vote and that's a you know that said so horrible presidents do yeah I\nLive in my ... if you listen to the proposition pockets I I'm doing whatever I can not to tell people how to vote I mean ... you can this is your job you bet my job is just to kind of give you guys are the facts on this and one interesting do\nBecause you bring up a reason to vote for it or is that if you were to look at what the gas tax was Nineteen twenty three when it was introduced as a youth taxi basically in lieu of toll boxes that's exactly what they said because they didn't want to spend money on on toll worker religion in a building so they put two cents because they realize hey we already have\nToll booths and they're called gas pumps right so they put two cents on that if you adjust for inflation it would be thirty cents now which is a disease now so that's one of the arguments on the ah no on six sided look what\nI Would I Would actually buy into that if we didn't also have the highest sales tax die of income tax the highest car sales tax sized car registration I you know we're just getting killed here\nWell I I Would say prop six is easily the most talked about proposition for a lot of reasons because both sides have I think very strong arguments that resonate with people in the pocket book and you know I mean we all drive there's no getting around it here in Los Angeles\nRight but I also think that you know the the the highway patrolman who's doing that proposition you know if the if it if you vote yes on it the freeways will crumble and you know take an eight billion dollars out of Southern California they never mentions that that is a gas tax and I think that's a tremendous\nI you know a lie about about that proposition there are on but I think they're all live there are on both sides especially on six there's a lot of exaggeration and ...\nWhat about a proposition eight that is a for the people are with dialysis right actually\nAnd it is it the right now that's the most expensive ballot measure on the eye on your ballot in November here or in terms of the amount of money that's been raised and being spent even more so than the gas tax uh and it may be the most expensive ballot proposition ... by the time we wow election day is that a union grab\nOn one side that's what they're saying right do you have two big dialysis companies\nAnd they operate I think it's like Seventy five percent of the market share and to what crop eight would do is limit their profit so we kept their profits like a hundred and Fifteen Percent twice and if they go over that they have to reinvest all the money back\nInto the dialysis clinic dialysis clinic or eighties being pushed by FBI you and the reason they got into this is because a they're trying to unionize a lot of these clinics but be\nA date the complaints coming from the workers is their leverage for unionizing these clinics ice and so this is their means to get into it it's interesting though yeah well a hundred million dollars or a hundred million dollars so far has been ... side and about twenty million by the yes side\nThat's unbelievable are real quickly let's go with a number of ten that's the rent\nControl yeah rents too high according to the yes camp they want a this bill or this law called cost Hawkins repealed that would give local control to municipalities to set rent controls the no side says no way no how because if you do that then big investors developers are going to stop coming to California they're not\nGoing to build apartments are not going to build unit the Affordable housing crisis will get worse right and so it works against what you guys are trying to achieve again really fascinating debate\nIt's it's another one if you you say yes people die no people died you know everyone's gonna die\nEveryone will yeah I'm trying to think of a question where people won't die probably prop twelve and then ... ...\nOkay so let's go direct everybody you have your podcast up yet called proposition\n... if you

listen to before you got to listen\nTo and if you already voted then listen to it and go find your ballot and refill all your ballot\nRight already sent mine in but what I like to do is I send it in

NBC as um she had remarks on her show that\nA lot of people didn't like and so she has left the building so Megan Kelly if you enjoy the program it is no longer going to be on NBC I don't know what she's going to do but I think they are like almost Seventy million dollars to find out what happened [laughter]\nTrying to get in trouble if you are a white person who was on last week or a black person and puts on white Halloween like that that that was okay as long as you address another character\nYeah I I don't know why in twenty Eighteen people even think they can talk about black face on the air why would you bring up I mean what what what did you not bring up that you could of uh instead of talking about you know people doing blackface for Halloween it's just sort of an odd strange strange thing\nMy Megan Kelly and I want to begin with to worry\nAbout is there a big apology right\nI'm Sorry I defended the idea as long as she's crying\nI'm Sorry I defended the idea that as long as it was respectful\nAnd part of the Halloween costume and moved okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nNBC's Megan Kelly issued an apology tonight to her staff after she defended the idea of wearing black face for Halloween while she apologized to us that she does a bigger apology\nThe country because this is a history going back to the teams are his mental shows to demean and denigrate uh a

incredibly volatile issue in this country\nFox News and yours truly are the targets\n... op ed by so I don't know what she's going to do now aides she's sort of um I don't know sort of kryptonite now\nBecause nobody really cares for her and we said that before NBC hired her when she was leaving Fox or remember why she was gonna leave Fox\nWe we've said right I mean all people would do is go back and listen to show don't hire Megan Kelly or she is hated by the Democrats because she's from Fox\nAnd the Republicans don't like her the way she treated Donald Trump so I don't know who's left I couple of independence and so I don't understand why they paid her that kinda money\nIt she definitely getting that the sixty nine million I think it's a\n... an ironclad guaranteed lock contract\nBecause it seems like there's maybe a clause in it because why is she she's got the lawyer and then she wants Ronan Farrow that being the meeting with her\nRight but but she has I don't think that that you know she could make a case that if NBC really thought that that was over the line and why did they air it\nYou know even if it's live in New York there on a delay and even if they don't catch it New York three hours later they air it in Los Angeles yeah it wasn't until the backlash yeah so three hours into after she said at NBC is still airing it\nThan I could easily you could easily pointed\nI go well where do you guys and think it was a big deal yeah you guys aired it for three hours and then they never said anything until the ah the backlash but you know and then they talk about the political correctness aspect of this and I don't think this this qualifies um falls under that category but Bill Maher\nHad a great piece on being politically correct and how political correctness is destroying\nAmerica looking back I'll play it for you don't often agree with you know Bill Maher on on almost anything but he's uh right on the money here when it comes to political
