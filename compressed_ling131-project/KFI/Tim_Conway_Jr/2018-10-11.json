they were filling thousand gallon tanks appropriate\nAnd not worried about it they didn't care and they'd never had an accident either I mean 'cause they were smart you know they wouldn't light it

Democrats can dehumanize Republicans Republicans that had to dehumanize Democrats and the other day um you know\nMost of us care about the same things um you know Tom Tate is the Republican mayor of Anaheim and he's a dear friend of my friends when we talk about immigration are we talking about the environment or we talked about taxes like we speak each other's language and I think most Americans hunger for that right now even if we're entertained by the more extreme stuff\nRight now speaking more extreme style is uh the mayor of Los Angeles with us John and can each left me with one question for you yes I here's one from John ah my wife Deborah as an addiction to black and white photos taken by X district attorneys does your dad have a gallery\nYes he acts as a show right now on ... tell

Donald Trump junior\nI think ... style and I can't imagine that'll happen but\nMan this guy always keeps himself in the news and and they say that if it wasn't for a microwave oven adding that Brett Kavanaugh would never have made it to the Supreme Court that Michael Evan at a pushed\nHim over the top that move or the very end with the allegations of of of ah getting rich\nYeah with Julie sweating it and that made it too crazy for people to believe that that happened\nAnd so he skated so it ... and and the and the Democrats are really turning now on on this guy and I heard three or four prominent people on cable news saying that this is the reason why the Democrats lost its Michael ...\nSo maybe his Fifteen minutes are up as possible\nWho knows why Bill Cosby's lawyer is making some requests speaking of lawyers find out what's going on\nBill Cosby arrived here yesterday he is now officially spent his first night in prison this is SCI Phoenix it's a brand new facility that replaced the greater Ford prison take a look behind me here we are expecting caused me to spend at least the next few days here as he is assessed and process\nCosby was given that sentence of three to ten years\nHandcuffed as he left the courthouse his mug shot was taken\nHe was processed over the Montgomery County jail then taken here to sci fi next is thirty eight hundred that facility is state of the art brand new we're told Cosby was served a dinner of baked meatballs with rice and gravy whipped potatoes and green beans [noise] he was given a prison\nSounds actually pretty good meatballs with rice and gravy whipped potatoes meatballs was rice and gravy it's better than the crap I ate last night for dinner meatballs with rice and gravy whipped meatballs with rice and gravy and potatoes and green beans\nAnd and fluffy we whipped potatoes and potatoes and green beans guys eat like a king\nHe was given a prison jumpsuit a blanket sheets towels as well as\nA high totally do that'd be good too [laughter] it if it's due to the art they have the as friends\nOr do you guys have anything else now does is it he was given a prison jumpsuit a blanket ... animals\nYeah and please don't say president in pain in the ass\nTowels as well as the hygiene kits now due to his age his celebrity and his medical condition legal experts say it's very likely cause people to be kept away from the general population\nGoing to be in a situation where he's going to be alone for most of the time because anytime he asked the goatee\nLegal experts say it's very\nWell what happened here because anytime you hold on singing was anytime\nHe has to go the meals are good activities or whatever he's going to need it as sport so I Would think that he's going to be kept out of the general population were with the other inmates to the greatest extent that they can possibly do that [noise]\nNow the district attorney here in Montgomery County says it's unlikely Cosby will stay in the county for a long after his medical condition and his security needs or assess he could be moved\nOver to a prison outside Pittsburgh that specializes in geriatric inmates hell my God and geriatric inmate for now we're live at SCI Phoenix I'm Randy killing all NBC than\nA what a crashing you know and to an otherwise uh unbelievable career I mean the man had all the fame in the world all the money in the world\nAnd he just couldn't stop you know he just had to knock women out with drugs and then raped them and he couldn't stop doing it you couldn't stop to it and I\nAnd and and that's how you know it's been\nYou know two or three decades since it really started to\nBecome well known enough that rape is not about sex but it's about power right and this is a perfect example urban example he's got he's got the money he's got the fame he's got the the the the power that's right so why would they need oh okay that's amazing huh\nWhat I had a I I think maybe perhaps the biggest lie of any celebrity I can and well I don't know I mean maybe OJ now it's got to be ... Cosby Bill Cosby had such a squeaky clean image\nHe had he was Dr Huxtable you know he was the the father of America and everyone watched\nIt well and we've talked about before a couple of weeks ago when the whole sentence came down the idea that that he uh reached doing\nThe right thing in ... in and out and yeah keep your pants a polar pull up your pants pull up your pants yeah and that's that was the downfall whenever you start preaching to somebody and then behind the scenes or raping nah there's a big problem with that people have huge problems with that and this is where you end up I\nNever checked it Hannibal Buress ever addressed it on Twitter or anywhere else\nI don't see a comedian who pretty much since Bill Cosby to prison yeah I don't think he did all intents and purposes\nUm box office this weekend of course a bigger or George Gallo I directed the movie that a lot on friday but there's another huge movie and it is going to be a coming out this weekend I Believe first man is that right oh yeah or the audio ... a as a Neil Armstrong yeah rise that open you\nKnow I think it is as we can all over the last year we go I like just yeah dirty six hundred theatres nationwide release date is coming up uh yeah it's on friday\nYeah so late tomorrow night that's held movie art for live on Cape I Am sick for\nWeekends KFI are a little bit different I'll show you what stricken on Kelly's Heroes\nFor ... enemy what's the what's an air a couch\nIf you'd like to lie on it and we can talk about your inner life\nOh ah no doctor wet either some questions about myself I'm not sure I Want to answer and for fans of the dark secret place here's Brian suits ... who's holding a sign that says I Do not consent to being recorded\nOK news ... said talk that would surprise you weekends on KFI stop by any time\nAnd I are radio station [noise]\nIn custody I'm Aaron vendor live from the KFI twenty four hour newsroom a suspected surreal burglar has been arrested in Malibu Kenya\nDetective said the man had a rifle at a long criminal history\nSo I go pick it up I get home\nThere's more shrimp in this thing off and they have at Sea World I mean this is a you know it it it's basically a long John Silver's it's like a the buffet of universal studios seafood buffet [laughter] it's all shrimp pounded and packed into this thing and filled with onions\nSo I called the restaurant and the guy said look put you on hold I was on hold for like three or four minutes I hung up I just threw the crap in the trash and went to bed is one of those you know like nights where you're like you know what they got me I'm I'm defeat yeah can't do anything I did better go to Ben in\nIn in the war of shakeout in delivery right they won that is a this battle goes into shrimp that battle was over to you you lost battle shrimp they got they won\nI just hung up the phone through that crap the trash and said I'm going to bed before I'd kill myself\nAnd I almost did oh they do not know I buried today is that now is national mental health awareness day you write that ya oh All right well I tell you that on a daily I almost bought myself then how about oh no it's the same day that's just I almost half\nA that's not bad [laughter]\nI got try hopping is that I should tell you don't you know what here I have an idea if you're a guide helping ... nacho hops yeast and just you\nKnow all the time and I like to hear the the gold pain that avocado fan than I Do tea and I'm all for it [laughter]\nAnd you're all wild ... hot it's pretty cool\nI did this a few years ago for the snap for the Graham\nAnd you're a big pure all guys so you you might have ended friendly done this before and where you you've got the bureau\nAnd you know you rub it in on your hands and then for whatever reason you have to kind of touch your face with your Noel right and you forget that you have pure L I Breathe that in yup and I did that actually intentionally\nFor the for the Snapchat an Instagram a few years ago and it is brutal but I could imagine that's probably about like your first house is going to be\nI I learned a lesson about ten years ago when I used to smoke cigarettes I pure rolled my hands and then let a cigarette in both hands caught on fire ... that is true true story MS I live at the lighter and it and they didn't burn just burns the top layer the pureval off right and it burns quick 'cause the demon burned my skin\nBut for a second look down on both hands", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Tim Conway Jr", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "11"}
