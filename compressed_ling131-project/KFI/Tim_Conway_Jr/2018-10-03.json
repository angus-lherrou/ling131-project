garage doors\n[noise] did you see people were split us up a little bit on social media yes yeah you and I just read said [noise]\nYou said hey Jerry Anne Chana attending out camp\n[noise] Johnny\nCan't show John ... by ... am six forty yes absolutely I don't forget to vote and got his new on the website to fear for the five weeks from today electric Solis left to give props it fast [noise] make John Cox governor [noise] do we care about much else not really [noise]\nBut there's a bunch of ballot proposition will be adding things too like if you have a very short time vote yes on sex John Cox get out of there and You're welcome to email us anything you want us to put on the voter guy will consider it you know it's like a local tax or were against all taxes in knowing all tax\nDon't mess with my time so you know who we don't talk about very often on the John ...\nIs George Alexander to back this is real name Alex Tribeca hosted jeopardy yes\nIt was like Seventy eight years old now and I guess he's considering stepping to do what he did last night I heard he\nModerated a a debate he did he moderated the Pennsylvania gubernatorial debate between Democrat governor Tom Wolfe\nAnd his Republican challenger man but you know Scott Wagner and they booed Alex [laughter] they booed him well I'm looking at one example it looks like some people said that he did more talking than the candidates and tried to sort of\nGrab the whole event for himself and he was a little bit you know\nHe's ... he's ... a little bit you know I'm very correct and I'm accurate ten day here's the next clue like he's very ... kind of personal lines me of a a Tony Randall playing Felix hunger\nSo we've got that same he says here he brought up the idea of a severance tax they might be thinking already what the hell is added why would I Want to know and he went on to a long speech about the severance tax before he got to the question in the middle of the debate\nWhile he was the moderator and I guess I don't know whether or not supposed to ask questions on if there was a panel of question as we are supposed to give speeches well I'm reading a quote here and it's ten Fifteen lines from him about the severance tax\nSo at some point or the audience started booing him [laughter] shut up and he actually turned around and said what did I tell you guys at the beginning no bowling or hissing and now you're directing it to me [laughter] [noise]\nThat's funny it said the I Wonder why you would agree to do this or does he live in Pennsylvania why would you care about the show was taped out here so I assume they lived here I uh\nI have to think well maybe he's from that you know Canadian\nHe has spent a forty years plus years as a forty five years as a game show host\nOr at least in the seventies yeah when I was when we were where he picked up jeopardy in Nineteen eighty four right so\nYou know forty five years hosting a game show you don't get to say much you don't get the show too much of your personality and yeah you can't get off script and in in this world where everybody's got a cable show a talk show on the radio a pod cast everybody's got all kinds of wild incendiary opinions\nAnd he's still hosting the game show and it's got all this\nThey got inside him and he's got paid yet he's got away he sees the world\nYou know to any complaint was they said that he prepared\nVery rigorously but apparently the problem is he's not running for Pennsylvania governor and he kept inserting his opinions [laughter] he's boiling over he did apparently made a couple of speeches he threw in some opinions he went to some back and forth how many times can you explain the daily double\nYou know and look at the ... looks like he was the only question yeah and then he was sitting in a chair with a little bored in front of who's got the two candidates across they can't stop jeopardy for this\n[laughter] so what what what other form is he going to get\nHe actually made a crack about priest sex abuse which is a big issue in Pennsylvania and he did crack\nAnd he said the approval rate of the Pennsylvania legislature is fourteen percent the only thing with a lower rating in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania is the Catholic Church but he did he said dad like a good one [laughter]\nBut it said oh he told a story about when he was a teenager attending a Catholic boarding school\nSo it was the Alex ... yeah that's what people as it was only an hour long with with the gubernatorial candidate he's now admitting it's a learning experience for me and I think I was too naive going into this I thought a conversation with work a lot better\nIt didn't so what he was trying to do is try to do a talk show and he was writing this entire gauge everybody in the conversation like it was kind of a round table talk show and you just type in when you have something to say but they were probably waiting for a question you know probably so often told stories probably all game show host want to do a talk show\nYeah I Know\nThat is true because you're right they're stuck to his scripted a format yeah\nAnd he's he's making a you know a billion dollars doing this but he you know it's making them crazy he's got stuff to say you ever want to get a laugh because only I pay attention to things like this\nWatch if you haven't done a long time had said jak on wheel of fortune he is on such autopilot even though he he seems it's friendly in casual it's like the same lines every time how you doing tonight good to hear good to hear let's play the game you ... that probably doesn't ... he probably does not even here and stuff so I just give me my fifty million dollars right [laughter]\nHi Tim Conway said all I Am ... wait a minute what is that

somebody has is that the ... that I'm running a bowl of edge of\nRoe is very it's a ... hey I I I Want to ask you a question you got to a specialist on proposition or measures six as a prop six ...
