...\nWhen there was a you know when the crowd is roaring if it was a Boston hen or Dodgers hit incredible\nI it's it's not a sport it's called back there and they and they live and breathe that it really is when you're out if you're buying a coffee or a newspaper and you bump into someone hey how about those ... they they are like that and all year round for all the sports\nRight but it's not just about you know it's not just you know hey what do you think about the ...\n... almost everybody that lives there knows all the players you know where they're from they know when they went to college they know what their record is they know where they came from they know what their salary is I mean they really are are in depth to you know a fans of the game it's a long cold winter that's right exactly right\nBut out here you know we get hit with a third inning we have a couple of uh you know by Dodger dogs were leaving the seven you know just to get out of out of the traffic so we're really our own worst enemy when it comes to\nBeing a fan out here you know the ... the rams will eventually have full stadiums of rams fans and there'll be like Green Bay but it's gonna take ten to Twenty years\nBecause there are a lot of kids who grow up here that didn't go to rams games with their dads are good the rams were playing here right\nUm but Green Bay is the exact same size as Burbank is about a hundred and five thousand people and yet they have their own team yeah that's incredible yeah and you're old Powell I'm Andy Smith is the chief of police there yeah he is ... did you did you go through the same classes either you know he's a he's younger than I Am he's younger you are you\nA boy and wild and chief of police in in in Green Bay yeah he's doing great a great guy that's incredible yeah All right I I Know you've got a lot of things you want to talk to about here including the the guy you're running against this building a waiver\nNow somebody it stopped me outside when I came down to see you at about a week and a half two weeks ago and somebody said hey you know this guy is running against a sheriff Jim McDonnell he says he's never had a command before\nAnd I thought oh surely you had to have a command right now you can't go from\nA you know just a a you know from a police officer has never been to command never been an assistant chief or anything to the to the head of the sheriff's department he's never had one\nThat I Know it he uh he rose to the rank of lieutenant which is a significant right he was a watch commander in Pico Rivera station uh the challenge is you know taking going from a watch commander overseeing you know a watch with you where you have Eighteen people on there too or an organization of Eighteen thousand it's a different job\nIt's impossible yeah well did he runs the station or is he ever died you know it at the ever I don't know oversee training or anything\nNo no he's a watch commander in the station and uh you know responsible for what went on for that period of time that he was there eight hours generally\nAnd so he never had anything to do with budget no never now and he's going to and and now the budget for for the LA county sheriff's department is three point five billion three point three three for ... so from going to nothing you know and he's like me yeah you know organizing the bills in his house to going to budgeting three point three billion dollars\nYeah it's a it's a totally different job than he's ever had to go into a job like this where you are responsible for the safety of over ten million people it is not the place to learn on the job you have to come in ready to roll could be dangerous anything could happen you know on any given day but\nThe guy who stopping outside he says he also I remember this very distinctly said he never administer discipline now that true as well that's true yeah\nYeah ... well like the LA Times is is not been a a a big fan of the LA sheriff's department they've been on our pretty hostile only the only report the bad news in the early sheriff's department but they did endorse you write and so you know even applying chicken gets a colonel once in a while you know\nAnd I'm proud to have their endorsements both the last time when I ran and and as well as this time around they've endorsed uh as the daily news and in that chain of papers\nRight but watch as soon as you win next Tuesday they're gonna attack you again yeah that's what they do at the ... times right now you're afraid of them or John and can do it\nEither take a break and come back we got a lot of issues to talk about you're running a week from tomorrow the big election direct yeah a lot of talk about that as well sheriff Jimmy ... whether it's gone by showing hey if I Am six forty thousand dollars we're going to give away when we come back hopefully you win but more news now they're in\nBailey school district has to pay a historic settlements out

U.S yeah even I re because he said [noise]\nYou said hey Jerry inch and we can hang out camp [noise]\n\n\nIf\nI Am forty Conway show McDonald's whether the election next Tuesday and we have a thousand dollars to give away a all you have\nTo do is tax a certain number of certain ... word to a certain number and you could win a thousand dollars and so you ever go\nTo your shot at one thousand dollars now than they can like key word cash to two hundred two hundred he'll get a sex confirming entry plus I'd already went up standard data method rates apply in the nation wide contact that cash cater to hundred two hundred\nAnd we're working with our law enforcement partners across the nation and around the world to be able to vet any threats that could occur hear anything we need to be up on a or people we need to be watching for the weekend a potentially avoid anything happening here\nRight okay um I ... it was very nice of you to to call me up I'm after the guy was arrested\nAnd you admitted that you thought it was me and it turns out it wasn't you were embarrassed so I thought that was very nice of you lease it meant when you were wrong about those pretty cool\nUm but that is a very serious thing though because not only\nCould have killed somebody and and that you know that's horrible but the fear that it puts into people you know I've had death threats not many and one of them came from a relative but I've had death threats here at the ... and when you when I leave here\nKnow if there if you hear like a squirrel in Bush or something it started with you there um and so the fear that these people have Maxine Waters the people at CNN and I you know the uh the Obamas the Clintons that's a real legitimate a fairly um and and that can't be you know I've overlooked\nNow there's a sense of hyper vigilance when you know that somebody is looking at potentially do you or your family are oh surely look at a situation like this where it's through the males and\nYou know if these individuals who do this kind of thing I think that they're ever going to get to the person they intend to they're going to hurt or killed some poor guy worked in the mail room or somebody who was delivering mail or or somebody along the way\nAnd it's just absolutely a horrendous the you know that the type of behavior with anybody who condones it then it's just a reprehensible\nYeah and it is a look at you know this guy it was a stripper in Florida\nAnd uh you know male stripper male model whatever in in Florida\nAnd so it makes sense that a guy who takes his clothes off for a living was not able to put six uh you know a successful bond together but I guess it you know what the FBI said that they said there was a latent fingerprint on the tape and that's where you know if you're working with bombs don't put it on tape because the he's a part of your tape is going to really hold that fingerprint\nAnd these guys look this is not the old days with the Unabomber or their cell phones there's computers there's DNA there's a million ways of Tuesday to catch you nowadays yeah\nTremendous resources go into obviously anything like this all of the law enforcement intelligence community partners work together to be able to try and take this person in the custody as quickly as possible and when he sends things like this out over over the the whole country you know the potential for something still to be out there is very real that it go up somewhere\nAh so we need to continue to be vigilant uh you know not only for this case but for for the day to day stuff we deal with um you know and there's this things to look for in this case the the packages were all similar\nUh but when there's too much uh in the way of postage or the or return address you know obviously is not from somebody you know and the packages to you ride a there's a number of things if it doesn't feel right you know be careful about it and don't don't move at a isolated and and call us\n... did they call you before they announced everybody that they call this guy are you guys in on it like it had an hour before so\nYeah there's no set time the the media generally gets it pretty quickly but we uh we get a notify as soon as something happens and ah and then we can do whatever we need to do based on whatever's going on at the time\nWere you shocked that it was so quick or did you think ah that you knew they had this guy\nNow they did a good job they are I mean they work this thing or a diligently and uh they were able to take them from New York or the DC area and then ultimately a California involved but also then it ended up in Florida so they had they had a run everything to ground they could did an awful lot of people working on this\nThey said there was a thousand agents yeah thousand officers a thousand people working on right it could even be more than that but when something like this happens\nIt do they get like you know a certain part of the FBI or their share station will people put on a pot of coffee a you know tell their wives or husbands or their bed partners uh they're not coming home tonight and work around the clock oh yeah\nOh you rented rented hired as as long as you can until you got to get some downtime and they get back up as soon as you can and get right back on it because something like this as a potential to you know a killer main people around the country\nAnd it scares the hell out of people look at last night you know after the uh the Dodgers a loss of the red Sox\nYou know people made their way to Union Station to go home and Union Station had a suspicious package there and it was shut down from ten o'clock till three AM and everyone else had to make you know uh you know other alternative plans to get home it's it's a it's a mess\nYou stay with us ... archer Jim McDonald's whether it's a ... when we come back we'll tell you what the website is and if you'd like to uh donate to his campaign or\nIf you'd like to uh

I heard radiolab just open the up and have\nA cat [laughter] live radio see what happens we'll have morning from six to ten on KFI [noise]\n\nYeah I have six forty Conway show Jim McDonald's with us he runs the Los Angeles county sheriff's department larger shares the five second largest\nShares the police agency in the United states but the largest sheriff's department budget a three point two billion dollars Eighteen thousand employees in Seventeen thousand inmates that's amazing Seventeen thousand every night you got to feed and elves and then keep from killing each other\nYeah and the thing she never even really think about the amount of laundry that are are oh yeah it would be a hundred thousand pounds roughly\nOf laundry a day wow I'm the meals that they put together it's like eighty eight thousand meals a day it's incredible the amount of stuff that goes into a run in the jail that size you know and not to mention medication and and all of the uh the other things that go on\nAnd you're really irresponsible you and your agency is responsible for directly for the safety of ten million people\nYeah yeah and I cried all the residents of Los Angeles county or\nHave they ever I Know it's not going to happen at your watch 'cause nobody wants to do it but has there been talk of splitting up the uh the LA county sheriff's department like the LA a USD\nYou know I'm sure there's been talk but there is a efficiencies economies of scale by having it out of that large because when you look at it we do what the LAPD does\nAh for the county so the traditional policing things but we also then as you said run the jail the courts the colleges the hospitals for parks search and rescue and a third of MTA so if you would have lost their separate police agencies they're the or the cost would be significantly higher each with have their own chain of command that communication would be reduced\nSo by having all of those under one umbrella that uh the taxpayers of LA county get a bargain there\nWhat happens if by by by do you have regular drug tests if if if the LA county sheriff's deputies smokes pot or they fired\nWell you get tested we test them if there's objective symptoms a you know somebody comes to work and there's a sign then yeah we have the ability to be able to test them on that\nAnd when I test positive well they go through the process is edition of disciplinary process they'd have their opportunity to be heard they bring in their experts and and you know when something like that you could uh you could probably expect that the defense might be they were in an environment where Osama smoke yeah that was fast of a and I think\nYeah but you got to be very careful I remember there was a couple of years ago a it was either LAPD or or the sheriff's department where a guy got pulled over for DUI 'cause he ran into another car\nThat's instant termination then\nOr do you I yeah I generally the second one and I'm not you know and if and if we uh if we can get people if somebody has an alcohol issue and we can get them into treatment and and do whatever we can to support them we try and do that\nBut we take it very seriously and somebody who is enforcing the law they they know the rules they they are the boundaries of that conduct themselves in a professional manner on or off duty\nHollow I'm All right so I if people want to donate to your campaign they can go to share of Jim McDonnell dot com yeah and there's reelect share of Jim McDonnell uh and then there's all these\nAh there's a fact check there's endorsements you can connect with them now you can buy all about shift every town with photos and it's All right there I mean man once this thing is over next Tuesday that's got to really you know free up a lot of your time yeah you\nCan it's a you know it's distracting and you're constantly trying to be able to balance the demands of the campaign with the the demands of the job and that it you know the job itself is eighty hours a week\nAnd so it is a it is very very uh exhausting to be able to get through the campaign season but it's worth it we have the opportunity to be able to help a lot of people she must be fundraising than seven days a week yeah yeah you're right about all the time you have to raise the money to be able to get your message out to ten million people across forty seven hundred

forty Conway show [noise]\nHey if we haven't Kerry is listening\nAnd he may not be I mean that's an option as well right\nBut if Jim Carrey is listening or this is just between me and Jim Carrey right\nJim Carrey is one of my favorite actors and like these dumb comedies I don't think anyone's better with dumb comedy than than a Jim Carrey I Am going all the way back to you know the bass dumb and dumber ace Ventura\nWhen nature calls cable guy of course you know he's the bad liar liar yes a Grinch um Bruce Almighty Bruce on my room and show that's exactly right fun with taking Jane I Dr seuss Horton hears or who this man yes men right on the response Herald there are there are all great\nRight um but Jim Carrey for last you know ten years or so maybe nine years\nHas slipped a little in the in the in the box office and I don't know whether he's what he's going through\nBut he's now almost exclusively with the anti Trump campaign and spewing out you know if if you vote for Trump your responsible for the the murders\nIn Pittsburgh you know simply by voting for a candidate you personally are responsible for eleven people being killed in a Jewish temple and the Senate synagogue your responsible right\nAnd I listen I I'm not going to get a pissed about it because it's so asked nine it's so dumb that it doesn't even it's not even worth talking about but\nThere are probably fifty to sixty maybe Seventy million people in this country who are all on the the Trump sucks Trump's got to go a Trump's ... says he's a liar he's a bully the whole run\nAnd I think we need more comedy and last\nA criticism of the president from from guys like Jim Carrey let everybody else do it let the narrow do it let everybody else do it but I'd hate to sacrifice one of the great comics one of the great ... minds of comedy\nAnd I don't know if there's a better physical comedian\nUm and I know that Jim Carrey when he was growing up in Canada\nAnd easy easy even said this before him\nBut he got into show business\nOr by emulating what my dad did Tim Conway and he was inspired by my father to get into show business that's a huge compliment right\nAnd I think we need more comedy out of him and less Donald Trump paintings and you know calling a Republicans ah murders because\nI think it was ... that said this but I'm sure have been scali somebody said it before Vin Scully but Vin Scully said at\nHarvey Korman ... funeral a hardcore me one of the funniest man I I think in the world as well by Jim Carey I'm Sorry Vin Scully at Harvey Korman service said about Harvey Korman he said it's very easy to make people mad\nTo make people mad it's very easy to make people sad\nBut it's very difficult to make people laugh so it's easy to go around and talk about how you know what a naval Donald Trump is it's easy to make people sad\nRepeating stories that are heartbreaking from all over the world but it's very difficult to make people laugh and I knew this time\nI think the comedians have to concentrate more on making people laugh leads to politics for others Jim Carrey is not going to change a single person's mind\nJim Carrey can do all the painting the want it's about Donald Trump you can blame all the Republicans for what happens at CNN or at a at the a synagogue and in Pittsburgh\nOr all the other bombs that were mailed out the Clintons the Obamas the whole runs and he can blame everybody for it and it's not going to change one person's vote in the United states not one I don't know\nAnybody and I met a lot of people you know I'm In my fifties I I probably make thousands of people of my life and I don't know one person not one\nWho said man I was a big Republican but I heard a comedian don't tell me that I was wrong so I changed my opinion I don't know one person\nOne who's ever said anything like that not one and you would think you run into somebody like that right you think you run into one person go wow I thought I was a big Donald Trump and then I heard to narrow say after Trump but then I jumped on the bandwagon so I'm now with the up after 'em ... not not one person so\nI don't know maybe it's just me but a tip to Hollywood comedians\nStick to comedy I think that's what we need you know millions of letting everybody else do the uh you know after Trump routine or where they you know Republicans are murderers and and what everybody else do that but these things economy we need more of that not less on Jim Carey or excuse\nWhere are the old I'm a pac bell used\nTo be so if you if you're familiar with that area
