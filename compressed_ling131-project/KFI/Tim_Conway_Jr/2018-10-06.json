and then you can gauge reaction and then decide whether that leads to something else or if it just leads to another tweet but but that Sarah Palin but here's my original point\nIt never was going to be anything other than Brett Kavanaugh being confirmed and I\nThis has more to do with my cynicism and knowledge that the Republicans were very clear they were very focused and they were unify going into this in the sense of this is about making sure that we can change the direction and trajectory of the Supreme Court\nAnd have it benefit our\nGoals and ideals so the next thirty five years\nDamn losing the house we could lose the house in November and get that back in two years we can consume conceivably lose the house and Senate\nAnd get one or both of those back in two years maybe four years but you won't have another opportunity to do something like this with this type of leverage so you have to go all in\nAnd and if you're a Republican senator right now you can make the public statements to make it seem as if this you're having a a you know crisis of conscience which are really struggling with this and and this was something that I think the Democrats messed up\nAnd I always talk about strategy I'm never tell you who to vote for him never tell you who to support but I Will tell you who I think as far as I'm making the correct step or strategic maneuver\nThe Democrats should never have gone after the the issue of sexual assault or attempted to sexual solved never never they should have gone after the record of judge Kavanaugh because most of his judicial record was not released it was hidden\nBecause in that you would find what he would have said about the president under certain ... certain circumstances you would have found\nOut his communications while he was an attorney working on the Ken Starr Bill Clinton investigation you would have found all sorts of things which would have been tangible and actually actionable\nIf you will\nAnd you could have made a principled stand in the moment in the way that you really couldn't with Dr Ford because of the late ... and the and the politics of it all now it is generated great\nEmotion but it didn't change anything and tomorrow judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed the Republicans have more momentum than they did a week ago they have a good economy second justice on the Supreme Court good job numbers\nAnd the Democrats made their position worse now than they were coming into this\nConfirmation hearing there's some fights you must fight you\nMust fight even if you lose this was not one of

quoting more stimulating\nI like to notice trends I'd like to see if I can see where society is going\nTo be politically be it in an entertainment sense or technological sense and I just came back from Europe not just came back but\nI Would say it near the beginning of the month\nActually last month the beginning of September I was in Europe went to Italy\nFrance and Spain\nAnd I noticed in terms of transportation\nThese electric scooters everywhere\nNow have you gone to Europe and maybe ten years ago so you would see bicycles everywhere but now it's scooters the bicycles are still there but you see these scooters these motorized scooters\nEvery where because if you know the streets are very small ... just having a car is an inconvenience as far as finding a place to park you think parking is bad in a city like New York no it's a thousand times worse in Europe\nEven with very tiny cars because the roads are just not designed for that many cars or even large cars but my my point is everyone has a scooter\nAnd people of all ages are using it as such a reasonable way to get around the city and I was thinking like wow how long before that happens in earnest in the United states yeah\nWe have this scooters in Beverly Hills and in Santa Monica in certain pockets but not to the degree that you'll see elsewhere around the world specifically in Europe\nBut I noticed one thing they're which also had not happened here until now\nWhen I was in Europe you saw ride share scooters you saw different companies like line which they have to share bikes out here already but they have to share screws that line was bird and and one other\nWhere people were basically renting the scooter is over the course of the day or an hour or so it was great for tourism people were using it to get around the city to see sites or what have you and then you could pick it up at one point and leave it at a drop off point\nAnd it was pretty economical and I was thinking like wait a minute that can't be far away\nFrom California or LA specifically and sure enough\nNot that I thought of it they thought of a long time ago but now it was about to happen\nLift has received approval to launch each scooters a whole fleet on the streets of Santa Monica\nWhere they will be sharing them probably in the way that I've seen it maybe you've seen as well they've debuted a new line of electric scooter specifically for this and last month\nThe Santa Monica city council allowed for electric scooter companies bird lined like I talked about\n... jump and lift to operate in the city as part of the shared mobility pilot program\nAnd the program permits each company to operate there's a specific limit the number of devices and I think that's a key and important for as many as I saw in Europe I think they took from that hey we don't want this to be overcrowded\nSo each company is allowed to operate seven hundred and fifty devices which could be east scooters or e bikes within the city for sixteen months just like a pilot program we're going to see how this works the good news is it helps people get around if if you don't have the means to get around\nAnd you can do it inexpensively the bad news\nIs if you live in those areas areas is going to be real crowded congested you will find these scooters bikes just about on every corner you'll see it in front of restaurants\nAnd it's going to be a problem because then you're going to have people who are coming in and out of the city who don't necessarily live in the city and you know nimby not in my backyard some people don't necessarily like that but it's interesting to see how this is going to evolve in terms of transportation\nIn our city we're moving away from cars finally thankfully\nAnd and using these modes of transportation which\nIn a way help with traffic if you didn't get people going around on scooters and and bicycles you may not like some of the byproducts of that but it helps our traffic and I'm someone who has a commute of at least an hour and Fifteen minutes each way\nAnd models just like I don't know five minutes and and oh I Wish vendors is like two minutes lives down the street I mean like I think don't you live close to them to\nNo no no no no I'm In Santa covered did you move\nA while I was in ... before I knew when nobody has ever been to the closest to got it okay now we have maybe what I was thinking of I thought that you 'cause you just oh I Wish I Wish oh my goodness so how long should commute oh it's about thirty twenty twenty five to thirty yeah 'cause I ... off hours off hours you otherwise would be like forty five to an hour\nAnd model house for about forty five forty five each way yeah enjoy yours\nNon actually fourteen minute bike ride away from here a nice\nBike ride okay for them than the obvious question is cause you consider would you consider this type a pilot program in Burbank area and all these each scooters isn't it and\nNow Joe you only look what like twenty seven or something like that you're not that all we can go with that\nYou know [laughter] smart man okay you're a little\nBit younger than some of us cause I'm curious to know whether folks in their twenties and thirties would actually gravitate towards this in in the grand scheme of things I mean if you're close enough would you write a scooter to work\nYeah it's not even a question for me that's a that's an easy go me\nSee I I think I'm too old I'm not so sure I Would rather students were even far we're close enough it just because I just need a little more metal around me maybe that's what I'm afraid I'm gonna hit a rock and bust my ass I think that's what it comes down to I used to do a lot of skateboarding so I Know what that's like it's just that after a certain point in life I'm not so sure I Would do that\nYeah and you know uh I actually just saw advertisements now after the scooter thing for a motorized the skate boards so that's a new feature coming out for a like a ride sharing program but with motorized skateboard so you can now but they're no handlebars\nKnow handlebars that's right but the way it operates it's really interesting it's sort of maneuvers like a snowboard so you can kind of ... the board so you're going straight you're going\nHorizontally I don't know how to explain that really\nLike to hover boards where you have two feet and you're facing directly for\nI mean it's that's probably the closest thing I've seen to the movements of have a board but you know it's actually on wheels I don't know like if they have kind of like ... or whatever going on invented but yeah it's a you know\nYeah I I'm too old I Need handled ... no no no no I Know because if I bust my ass that means\nDoctor bills I just can't fall like I used to anymore that's the difference between twenty eight and forty eight\nI mean it sounds like just free money I mean you know up if you fall in one of those things\nYeah I don't I don't know if I can sue for being stupid I mean I can too but I don't know if that's a winning proposition if only because no one told you dumb ass to get on a scooter skateboard motorized or otherwise and try and how fast does it go ... did you see\nThe scooter this of the um the ... I got I was looking like twenty five or some other way to\nFederal and handed off yeah no that's slow down they they limit the ones in Santa Monica yesterday to Fifteen man yeah yeah and I mean I Can't imagine ... I but I mean\nOh no no no no no that's okay I'll pass some ... ... more stimulating saw\nHer radio station [noise]\nWater back I'm Aaron bender live from the KFI twenty four hour news from the hurricane driven a high tide has breached suburban Long Beach\nIt's a very exciting industry\nCan you break down from me some of the ... maybe my were difficulties but some of the things which are necessary to put on a show like this that\nPeople may people who are listening just wouldn't understand it is a tremendous event in scope and size and you're doing it for free in other words is free to attend how do you go about coordinating event on this scale\n[noise] absolutely well I'd I'd like to say you know what the one man show but the fact is is that there's hundreds of people working on coordinating this on a daily basis\nAnd if you you know produced events or you know anything about doing a vast you know typically they happened in too deep right everything happens on the ground mhm\nWhen you're talking about an hour show everything happens in the air as well as on the ground so you're talking about it and effort to coordinate more agents feet and it's typical so we're talking about [noise]\nEverybody from the FAA to the FBI to the local fire\nI'm marine safety of hassle in this case we pull resources from Long Beach fire from our Orange County sheriff and just about every agency that sort of in the neighboring areas and that's really a community effort and everybody is excited to be part of it because they believe in the air show and they believe\nIn the family friendly and patriotic nature of what people are coming together to watch so it it's pretty incredible it and it's a really a team effort\nWhen you talk about the team effort even though this may be an in an annual event I don't see that there's any time in between for example a this year's great Pacific Air she'll be October Nineteen sue the twenty first\nAm I wrong to suspect that October twenty second or maybe shortly thereafter you're already starting to plan the next year show in\nFact you're correct we're already well underway with respect to the twenty Nineteen show and believe\nIt or not we're already well underway and planning our twenty twenty shows how we\nSee things that happened uh you know pretty far in advance and as far as requesting military assets and working with the\nUh the navy and air force and all the various branches of the military to let them know hey we're having an air show we're interested in having your assets come to Huntington Beach we have to be at least two years out or requesting that um and then the rest of the planning obviously followed suit so we're we're planning pretty far in advance\nYou talked about some of the coordination but if I'm not mistaken the great Pacific Air show is the only one which is over the Pacific ocean do I have the correct\n[noise] you know what I don't believe so I think we also have the uh there's this show up north the Pacific northwest that takes place or sort of in the bay area I'm not familiar with any other shows that are taking place directly over the open Pacific Ocean so I I suppose technically I Believe that's correct but I make them be corrected\nWell let me ask you this what\nI should say why Huntington Beach why do you think Huntington Beach to the best of your knowledge has been so open and so welcoming to lend their name and also open up their city to something like this because ... Huntington Beach is already a great city in of itself\nIt doesn't necessarily need to have another great event but how good of a partner has Huntington Beach the city then\nWell I Can't stand up great things about the city of Huntington Beach everybody from our chief of police chief handy a chore mayor and city council\nThey've been absolutely tremendous and they've received this event with open arms um in fact without the city this event quite frankly wouldn't have happened so you know I think the what the city of Huntington Beach I understand is that\nThis that that brings the right type of crowd into our city right so it's not a ruckus crowd we are talking about family as we're talking about patriots were talking about people that enjoy this type of an experience I mean I'll give you an example last year the attendance numbers for well in excess of a million people who came into our city\nMany of them from overseas and out of the country and from you know outside of your typical geographical trading area we didn't have one single harassed\nAnd so we're very proud of that fact I'm we're also proud of the fact that you know the great Pacific Air show is the most attended outdoor annual event that happens in the state of California at this point and we're just getting started so those are some pretty impressive fact\nDo you have time to possibly enjoy the show and see what's going on or you just running around trying to make sure that everything is perfect and you don't have time to look up in the sky\nWell lucky for me I have an amazing team of production folks of PR marketing and you name it so behind me as an amazing team of people who are making me look good and\nAh I I Hope to be able to sit and enjoy a bit of the show but I'm afraid I'll probably be entertaining are are sponsors and our gas and and really frankly trying to lay the groundwork for the next five years of this air show because our plan is substantial grow\nOur plan is bringing on meaningful sponsors and partners and really turning this from Justin air show into one of the greatest outdoor lifestyle festivals that our state has to offer\nI think this is fascinating Kevin could you hang on for one more segment because we've got to go through who is going to be performing in what the ... so could you do that for me one hundred percent\nMy guess on the line right now is Kevin Eliot air show director for the great Pacific Air show we're talking about this wonderful event which is going to be October nineties the twenty first and KFI is going to be down there it's free to the public we got so much more to tell you about this is a two income with junior show Kelly in for him if I Am just for\nConstruction underway on a new uh fifty ... acre park in Florida ranch on may soon it'll be called blue park after ...

series and if you go even deeper this is how it's setting up for the Dodgers great star in game one they had a real you know in general you open up the series\nHe's probably the third or fourth best picture on the Dodgers definitely no better than a third\nThen you have tonight Clinton cursed Shaw\nAnd he's respectfully probably not the best picture on the Dodgers anymore\nHe's the most well known he's been the most consistent he's won I think three ... young his he's certainly going to be a first ballot hall of famer when all is said and done\nBut he's had some lingering a injuries and

national league teams left\nThe Dodgers are widely regarded as the best team left\nDodgers lead the league if I'm not mistaken a near the top in stolen bases being they can run they led the national league in home runs and runs scored in fact they had a franchise record in terms of home runs hit the season they can rake as they say\nThat the best starting pitching there's a question in terms of
