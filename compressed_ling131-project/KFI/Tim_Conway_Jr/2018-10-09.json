having an affair with the White House intern to remember when he was then should you apologize directly to hurt he gave that we're to answer I mean\nI Can't imagine who would want to hear another word from either one of them or anything\nBut they're not going to talk about the bad stuff anyway then I got to go out and talk about the Lewinsky scandal she probably won't spend that much wants to get into she can do an hour of anti\nTrump oh yeah absolutely and I don't know and you know he can't even tie shoes anymore\nNo I Know you think she'll do most of the speaking but they are they appearing

a two\nTime I'm\nAn opportunity came up it's just one and a million the police department I had retired from the highway patrol and the police department uses retirees out at the airport Palm Springs international airport\nAnd um I applied for a lieutenant there at the department I'd gotten to know quite a few of the people and he encouraged me to imply for it and I did and I was approved by the
