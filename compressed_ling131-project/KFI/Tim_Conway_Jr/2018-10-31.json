you know their team some of the teams that you know it's it's I I was a little disappointed about that\nBut you know some of these teams that are in playoff contention or really striving to make the super bowl seems like the ... the rams and the Philadelphia Eagles today the super bowl champs or the Houston Texans for example who won I think five in a row now\nBut they got ...

learn the rams scheme and start playing to the right away\nYeah I think a guy like that on the defensive line he'll come in and situations probably\nOr where they can really take advantage of his past rushing ability so I think he can make an immediate impact and when you have a line now\nAnd if he does make an immediate impact well you have air and Donald running a you know rampant through the

we know it's ... it's it's a holdover from uh when we were an agricultural economy right just like so many things I don't want to get into politics but there's a lot of stuff that they didn't do it from the old days you know what I mean it's right it's not the old days anymore show all the write in any case this is one of those things are prop seven would bring a ... you know into the modern age\nAlthough doesn't mean that only if the only if the feds change it\nCongress would have to act and I think\nThat gets Marco Rubio a um with a bill he gets to decide a well known users or to either he's introduced a bill that a word Congress would allow states to kind of decide for themselves\nYeah so that's what we're so it's just the first step like nothing happens if prop ... passes right away\nIt just it just pushes that helps it along yeah but I if if you\nLook I think is a country we got to say yes or no to what you have some states doing it in some not because then every time you get on a plane you know we all have smartphones in the smartphone will figure it out but if you work at let's say you live in I don't know pick a a a state you know I like let's say you work on state at state line in Nevada\nAnd you work in in Vegas you but you live in California you got to figure that out now every time you go to work you gotta leave an hour early to be there or you know ten minutes on ... ... it's bizarre yeah you're right I Know either the whole country has got to get on board or the country's got to do one or the other\nBut this is a crazy and and and you know what they started doing it\nThey pushed it later so Halloween it would be lighter out\nSo Halloween so kids could trick or treat while it's still light out what kids don't trick or treat when it's light out kid's trick or treat when the sun goes down and so the exact opposite if they didn't earlier and it made it you know darker earlier the week before then kids who go out at four thirty five circuitry now they're going at six thirty seven\nThat can be exhausted they're going to the ... you know the uh Halloween hang over the next day\nI'm ... you know I got to play this for mark we did this yesterday and this is a woman who is trying to began eyes Halloween is that right a bubble\nA I got to find out where this is what they're talking about salads and how to give you know how how Halloween\nShould be healthier and it's it's sick\nWell it's one thing to measure healthier hold on one with the one uh oh yeah ... yeah you got to listen to his mark I know you're a big guy you know the ... yeah but I'm not I'm not I don't think I don't I Know you gotta figure ... you know you know preaches you don't\nTry to get anybody on it except bender and did you get bender honored he killed himself I make I didn't try to get him on it's just one was okay All right and you feel better right yeah but Mark's an inspiration here we got\nSo Halloween falls on the last day of October grocery stores have been stocking though as many boxes of candy for weeks so people can get a jump on what some call the food holiday season for trick or treaters a little bit of sugar is certainly acceptable\nOkay that's fine so far right\nThe dietitian Patricia Bannon offers these commonsense tip\nHere come the sick tips\nFor Halloween you know let them eat candy but maybe three pieces of data they get to see\nThree pieces a day three pieces between houses [laughter] you know when you're out trick or treating it's like I can eat three ... pieces be your time but between the time I leave this house they get to that house\nYeah this is a ... a three piece limit will do exactly what Tim was talking about which is it'll create an underground economy of black market candy that you don't tell your parents had things actually right\nNow maybe it's only for a week and then all of a sudden he disappeared in and says\nThere's and all of a sudden you steal the candy from your kids\nThere's more to Halloween and just candy parents they have to get creative to make it fun\nCan give them different types of ... ball\nLike a like a dog you give a dog a ball\nIt varies a bomb you can try and increase physical activity when you have Halloween party maybe\nA little too square yeah [laughter]\nLike in China because like I Can't even get Halloween party maybe\nA little too square okay then we'd discovered last night nobody knows with two square is you know four square that's the name of the game oh\nRight maybe there is a game called to square it's a limited died a dumb down or watered down version of four square I never heard of it\nOr they're going to treat them or to a party you want to harm your children with coping Tricia from something with protests from plant to some fiber things that are going to help ...\n[laughter] ... I mean you know listen Halloween is just a lost cause under ... is is that why try to save it let them enjoy them to be fair she's ... please because it's tough enough for us begins by she is not pushing a vegan thing she was just that was one of her things about ... crazy walk out\nThe last thing you want to do is send your kid out trick or treating hungry giving that\nAnd I ... I Believe that yeah okay so let's listen to the U.S jets that you're crazy\nSo giving them a balance nutritious meals for snap before they had out as really keen to that they don't over indulge dietitian\nLaurel of all it's a fan of sneaking in a bit of greens for kids of all ages but understand that's not always realistic\nIf we can all ... wonderfully all the time when life be great but that's why the holidays are challenged because we're on the run and we don't always have all these good things when we need them how to\nCounterbalance all that sugar she suggests trying powder grain", "show_name": "Tim Conway Jr", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "31"}
