in the world series for back to back here I'm\nPam I got to be honest with you too it kind of a a battle of emotions because the red Sox have a lot at Dodger connection from their coaching staff\nAlex Cora was a good friend of mine and really took me under his wing when he's playing shortstop for the Dodgers in their early two thousand truck right a key part of the eighty one Dodger team All right\nGood went with a with the center field or for the Dodgers are the eighties and the other two thousand so there's a lot at Dodger connection so the Boston Red Sox and there's a theory\nYou see

[laughter] right\nUm I I don't know we can cut the music I don't know why I give you guys have opportunity to sound like idiots on the air I I shouldn't do that\nIt's like you guys are are just you know it's like you're like three weeks old I'm not talking about belly or did you want I'm Talking about bender and an angel and and and and you're not concentrating bender you should be embarrassed by that eight million\nDollar you know and I know I run I set it on my I Know some of the angels [laughter] I was thinking gosh thinks think big a half a trillion\nDollars yeah five hundred billion okay the actual answered a bell the it was going to win it's five billion dollars\nGo bend or you were off by almost five billion [laughter] an angel Europe by four hundred Ninety five that might have been I've worked with ever yeah she ate there like her gumption for going for it well I I don't I don't mean no no no I mean\nIt's it's like um hey guess side you know get so many people are in the studio with me right now a trillion\nOh wow now it's not right that the ads you\nChoose a but yeah so five billion dollars worth of free advertising five billion dollars and which is incredible\nBy ... there's nobody that uses the media better than Donald Trump nobody and they put this piece together it's not very long I play the beginning part of it here uh let's see where it is\nAnd there's a fundamental choice a fundamental choice for artists on here it is the ability to influence mass media is an actual\nReal life superpower the car dashing for instance have earned over a hundred million dollars with that power\nYeah hundred and Seventy five million at last count\nBut by far the best media influence or that I have ever seen is Donald Trump while other people get buried by scandal he thrives on him he won the presidency through a hailstorm scandals that really no one else could have come through despite spending only slightly over half of what Hillary did on his campaign\nHe spent three hundred and thirty three million dollars on his campaign she spends five six fifty seven\nAnd that was because Donald was able to get the media to influence votes towards him for free despite the fact that many of those outlets were trying to do the exact opposite\nAnd that's why in this year we're going to talk about why Trump is able to thrive in today's media environment and how he controls the media so well to be clear I'm not supporting or even criticizing Trump in this video I'm personally just interested in how all of this works so\nLet's begin with what it is the Trump wants and that's pretty simple Trump wants to have his core message repeated whatever that message is at any given time and he wants that as often as possible until it sticks in your memory and all the opposing messages are just drowned out\nAfter all what gets repeated gets remembered and what gets remembered gets done to be clear this isn't unique to Donald Trump brands pay big money to do this all the time\nYeah here's or the example of that and again it's a it's a great I'm a breakdown of what happened during the elections or charisma on command and that's I'm On a YouTube but here's a perfect example McDonald's Sears this in to our minds every day\n[noise]\n[noise] right I'm loving it right everyone knows that everyone knows about a bomb bomb bomb I Love it I Love it and he's ... I and when you hear I'm loving it you'd think McDonald's\nAnd that's why these traditional news sites have to put their their headlines and they have to make them you know very interesting ... on the front page\nSo like for instance or TMZ does a great job at this I'll just give you a comparison the LA Times to um to TMZ LA Times Sarah Silverman says Louie, Louie CK or just disappeared oh here it is I'm\nTouched himself in front of her\nWith her consent I um they should have left off with their consent and then people would've clicked on and go oh did you do what they did the if it was a concern about him but I don't know others are also extremely dangerous hurricane Willa aims for Mexico's west coast\nAnd then Michael have an id hit with four point eight five million dollar judgment for unpaid debt as court orders eviction of his law firms so those are the interesting stories right I'd probably want to click on all three of those\nUh officer another one officer kills suspecting fatal shooting of fellow Georgia law and and so there are some interesting you know I'm articles there\nOn on the website and you know those are for that you're you're probably click on but TMZ\nDoes a little better job than that and that's why a lot of people are going to TMZ ah here's one Kyle gender sued for stealing born to sparkle I I'd be want to check that Derek Jeter selling his New York home is New York castle\nFor Fifteen million dollars and you can look at pictures of Jerry Derek Jeter as New York castle and then the next article is right around ... Davidson engagement was hollow no wedding plans\nAnd so you can see that you know the TMZ\nThat doesn't have to rely on hard news has the more interesting\nPictures and more interesting video and headlines up there because they don't have to tell you about what's going on in ... right the the standoff in tours in it that's not you know that's local news it's hard news and they don't really you know sort of um you know a deal with that\nSo if you do if if you go to our website\nLike you know Drudge Report um MSNBC um on the left or Breitbart on the right you have to have continuously continuously you have to update it and give people a reason to click on things or else that website is going to go out of business it's all about\nThe cliques it's all about page views how much time you spend on the site and that's all that advertisers care about they really don't care what's on the site\nAh well that's not true I mean there is you know X. rated material there is a lot of advertising won't bother putting stuff up if you're in that in that game\nBy with a few exceptions they really don't care it's up there\nThey just want to know that people are looking at it\nAnd so it is that the reason why we got to keep changing make me everything fresh fears 'cause we don't put up here you're gonna find it somewhere else\nAnd you're really going to only have about three or four Web sites you check into on a daily basis I mean you're checking do better I daily by about five or six yeah I got it for like four maybe four or five and whenever I find a new one it's like a like a romantic first month and then I get tired of it and you know we break up yeah and all\nAnd all look on Twitter in generally there's yeah maybe about a dozen ... uh even though I follow a lot about a

don't get there till the second inning they're down for nothing\nThat can happen when let's say will but could buy the least expensive seat is way up on top around six hundred and fifty bucks\nBut Sunday is going to be a hell of a a a ... a sports day in Los Angeles I mean you're going to have\nThe rams plane rams are undefeated and there'd be playing at one thirty against Green Bay the Green Bay Packers are going to be in town at the coliseum that's a huge huge game\nThe rams and there's a lot of Green Bay Packer fans out here a lot of people live with used to live in Wisconsin are out

in town and potentially the Dodgers in Red Sox\nAll three games will be in Los Angeles it might be a very easy Clipper a ticket to get\nThis Sunday because it'll compete against the Dodgers potentially in the world series so I imagine if you go to stop hub for Clipper seat probably get a pretty good deal good deal\nRoger with the ... says he wants to you just wants to be rich enough to buy a pair of field level seats one or two Dodger dogs a couple of beers in a helmet size nachos\nYeah it is ten grand right now he'll be fine but that is\nYeah the the seats for the Dodgers the first

got to be Ken May not wait a minute what was the last play of our fence from the giants was a to point conversion but that only took it to three that took it well yeah that took it to three so so if if you had bet the falcons to cover you\nWere fine until the giants converted that two points\nOver the last two points\nThat they were twenty three day Eighteen\n... seconds left now while giants converted a to point conversion tested the touchdown but the giants won or lost they lost okay I bet it does make sense to do that because then you can tie with a field goal yes right but\nIf you're the ... if you're if you bet on the falcons to come all by God\nThen they ... what what potentially really is a meaningless because if you're looking at the giants they have no chance that's right\nThat's amazing yeah hey I founded Dodgers seed here it's in the Dodger club how a Dodger dug out club for which is as low as you can get\nWrote a that his front row man wrote a\nTwenty two
