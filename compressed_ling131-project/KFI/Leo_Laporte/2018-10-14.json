{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "Okay ah I said before the break that there are ways now in which a a\nHouse can actually sense how much electricity is being used and from what and you know what is the product that I'm Talking about relatively new and it's\nActually called since S. E. N. S. E.\nAh I Believe the ... cents dot com but I could be wrong about that you have to go to check it out but what it is it's literally an electricity monitor so now we've talked about how ... works in your house\nWhen uh the circuit leaves the panel goes out to specific appliances and then the remainder of the electricity flows back to the panel\nEvery appliance every light that you've got leaves a special kind of signature on that a circuit or dislike a fingerprint and this sense device actually you can hook it into your main electrical panel and it actually it uses machine learning and it eventually figures out\nThe location and the usage of every single light\nAnd appliance you've got in your house and it sends it all to an app\nSo it allows you eventually to start making smart decisions about your usage it does push notifications about house activities so you'd be out somewhere and you're like hey why did my bedroom light go on to sense actually knows that that's your bedroom light\nAt it knows whether you left your oven on and eventually you're going to expect things like this are going to end up talking to your solar system and telling your solar system hey we're moving into peak hours or I Want some a more energy from the back\nOf battery to supplement what we're using on the house so that we don't cross over into that next echelon of a higher rates just amazing\nStuff All right uh let's talk to Matthew Matthew welcome home\nThey're a big fan of your show much care for twenty two years and Irish we note that means it's time that he puts on your ... thank God for the heart radio ads I downloaded I can get all day long I Love you guys are right um recently hired\nWhy did I even doing heart promos spot I should have just went to UMass you know so that was awesome thanks but\nNo problem and a higher to ... up here to build a retaining wall up against a mountainside hillside and um and uh\nIt down\nAnd I came home from work and they had already put in for levels of modular box with the edge of the kind of back each level and they were within inches of the health they carved away and a immediately came to mind 'cause\nAnd um I was really concerned and they uh they told me they were going to put the drainage\nAt the top of the law\nAnd instead of having a wall set out from the carved away for a good twelve inches they also didn't count or think that first row of blocks in eight to ten inches below the\nI got you know the ground so yeah do you want to know what's going on with that drain did they do it right or did they do it wrong\nBut I Do I stop them from doing I think red flags one off and in fact when I got an idea about telling them out on my wall built um kicked him off jobs I fired him on the spot I'm just wondering if they're not that I don't know for drainage the very top oh I don't see how that would work\nOkay so one real quick question Matthew and hopefully we hear it because I think you're signals cutting in and out a little bit uh how high is this retaining wall\nAbout six feet maybe seven six feet okay All right so here's the answer to your question yeah a\nRetaining wall that large it's holding back that much of soil should have a drain near\nThe bottom of the wall because what happens\nIs a it's called hydrostatic pressure water moisture in the soil\nHas the ability to push harder than the soil itself against the back side of that wall so now sometimes guys who were building these things get confused because they see us whale which is like a little concrete gutter at the top of the wall that's great\nAh to put a whale at the top so that surface water\nFrom the rain and the hillside that's running off hits that little gathering that it gets conveyed somewhere else instead of feeling over the top of the wall but\nFor the entire hillside itself there should be a a gravel base down at the bottom and inside that gravel base there should be a French drain periphery to drain\nThat will pick up in the lead off the water that's building up behind the wall otherwise this happens to retaining walls all the time when this isn't the case\nOr that water could potentially push right through and actually pushed that wall over so I think he made a good call there or was the right way to go uh hire somebody who knows how to build retraining walls and get it finished right\nThanks Matthew appreciate it uh we got Janice welcome home\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I always watched on capital [noise] [noise] [noise] but here [noise]\nI Want [noise] absorbed much because I also you stay on [noise]\nAnd [noise] ... [noise] the only really really great [noise]\nYou know what Janice\nOr you know what you mean you need to go down to your local flooring store and check out some a luxury final like\nHow can you know it's not vital like your old will no limits that she by all these are playing some would end the inter lock with each other so they look\nLike hardwood flooring but they are vital through and through and because of that kind of at the local just coloration a from a salt circles during a say on that you get because you know if you have to stay on in the exact same spot week after week after week the salt eventually catches the into the finish the\nHigh on the move it around and you get that disgusting salt ring right which is very embarrassing it's not good to have a salt\nRing on your floor so the vinyl planks flooring will take care of that because the it's a resilient it's soft every one is going to be jealous of the way that your floor works or looks and then er after the sale you just sweep up the salt you can uh ... uh and uh you're good to go\nWell I'm Glad I call it I Will say that for a while for you if we can\nThank you so much Janet\nOkay I'm hey\nThanks to our hot to call yes if you were listening and thought why does weirdos calling in yeah we just have so thanks to Darcy in John ... miles\nSpecial mentioned to my friend Alan why you didn't participate today but he begged me yesterday to mention his name on the air out when okay\nIt was the Clark famously said any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\nAnd that that's true and I think it is that electricity is just about the biggest magic around we have learned to conjure it from an air\nWe use it to light our way to wash our clothes cook our food drive our cars next ourselves together whether we're a mile away or ten thousand miles apart in fact\nOur relationship yours and mine depends upon this magic every week one of wonder I Love match and even more so I Love wonder because of the magic to create in me\nI Try whenever I can to make wander my universal response who likes it reminds me of how young I Am\nOf how little I Know how blessed I Am to be here\nIt has a way of stopping me in my tracks and making me see that there is always more good news around me than there is bad and that's something that we need to be reminded of always I Believe in magic but I don't believe in grownups\nHas grown ups have no wonder adults that's fine\nBut grownups really grown grown past tense as in someone who is still here but all done growing now that\nThat is a scary Halloween creature grown ups are always the ones out there doing stupid hurtful things people who lost perspective\nI think that the great secret to getting older is to embrace adulthood never allow yourself to become\nA grown up we live each day literally around it by magic\nIn miracles and not only do we choose not to understand them like electricity would choose not to celebrate them so I tell you this\nIf you don't believe in magic because your vision has grown damned if you don't believe in magic you're walking around with your eyes close if after your brief few years here you literally thing that you've done it all and seen it all on life has just become Monday and mundane then let me be the one to tell you\nYou're clearly to self consumed because objectively speaking we are swimming in magic and in miracles from the moment we arrive\nAnd we haven't even left the shallow end of the pool the poet you wrote this world is full of magic sings patiently waiting for our senses to grow sharper and I agree so perhaps today consider stopping for a bit to marvel at all the magic around

I don't blame him I completely understand\n'em but at the same time it's very inconvenient and the sad thing is pirates are not inconvenienced they know a complete and they don't care if they know exactly how to get the movie to enter the pirate channel into bits aren't all that\nIt's only normal people were inconvenienced people who are in most cases bought the movies and just want to watch them on vacation please\nYeah well the hardest part was with a big group of people is deciding which movie to while\nI bet [laughter] my favorites but I got to the whole crowd you know I I Know exactly\nWhat I loved it though that Netflix and Amazon Prime both added the ability to download not all their collection but some of their collection because that's really helped me a lot that makes it a lot easier to travel [noise]\nBoy does work like the ones that transfer over again from ... to go anywhere and then back to time I can download those there in in the primary up the ones that I own right so we're shepherded\nYeah that's very nice yeah and the and you know again like I said the only thing I have to keep an eye on is has it expired 'cause you have to have Internet access to to re renew it and are often do she\nShe that's why I thought I could download a bunch of others on my old phone and they leave it at an airplane\nAnd you can't just oh well that's interested in ...

eight eighty eight asked we owe the phone number [noise] upon we go with the show db in Pasadena hold Haiti\nOh All right\nThank you for taking my call\nYour well thank you for calling Didi what would I Do without you\nKnow I Am about to branch off that space okay and I have a question and they claim that it's free why pie for unlimited device fish but then\nThey say they throw in a like a hard line I'm ... and I don't quite get\nWhat the hard line for I Know I have on at the house and I think ... my router that helps all my wife I threw out the house I don't watch hardly or is it faster speed do I really need it\nIt's just colder that you don't have to use it it it just comes with it so your your service comes into the wall with a hard line right\nWell that's what they have a a they have like what would be an outlet but for a\nYou know and it comes in and comes into the cable modem which turns the signal on the way\nWhat what what do you mean a cable\nModem ... who's your ... what kind of what kind of service do you have is it is it from a phone company from a cable company who's who's the Internet service provider\nThat much but I Need help with I don't know it's off\nThe icy I don't I see so they the office the people who own the building said and we're going to include why fight we're gonna including Internet\nCorrect I got it okay so so they're doing it OK okay\nAnd so you don't know who they're getting it from but they're getting it from a local provider of some kind of go in and then the reason they give you a hard line is because some people want to connect their computers directly\nThere's other benefits at that faster and some devices require not everything has watched by okay so that's kind of normal to provide that\nOkay you have a Jack you have a Jack ... what we call it ethernet Jack in the wall looks like a phone jak\nFrom what I ... yes yes that's exactly right thank you for that\nYeah okay that's called ... that's a tough choice is not you pay the landlord for this Internet access or they just throw it in with the rent\nThey throw in the ... act I don't I think I'm probably gonna have to get my own\nBoy a ... so that's the question as to landlord ... thank you for throwing it they'll jak which is connected to nothing [laughter] oh that\nWas to you ask them what do you provide Internet access almost certainly they do what I mean that's possible why it's pretty typical though when you read office space\nThat that's wired up for Internet access but that you then have to go to the Internet service provider is wired to this place up in in by Internet from it\nOK okay quick question about that do you think it's a possibility for me to transfer my I'm a start up company do you think it would be possible for me to transfer my Internet company from spectrum to a building twenty miles away like\nProbably not so that's another question for the landlord you have to ask the landlord what Internet is available in this building\nAnd you can't transfer it to your building unless spectrum is wired that building up they may have twenty miles away not germane one way or the other spectrum is in the neighborhood they may well have\nWe get our building for instance the studio I'm In right now we have the local cable companies wired up they have there's a closet with all of these connections\nIn part of the building and the cable companies there so it was a local a fiber optic Internet service provider called ... that I think there's other companies as well and they're all in the closet and then you go to whichever company\nWant to use it has to be one of the ones in the closet and say this one is what I'd like in my office\nSo you okay do I I think you're going to want to talk to the landlord and say tell me which one of my choices if it's spectrum you could add it to your existing spectrum service perhaps [noise]\nUsually cable companies charge differently in charge a lot more for business connections than homo yeah oh yeah so uh but you and you want business Internet because there's you know that they're usually the qualities better et cetera et cetera\nUh ... you should see what the choices are and then you might want to do some research by calling the different companies available to you just like when you buy a\nHouse or rent an apartment you ask the previous owners of the landlord well what kind of Internet you get here and ah and they'll tell you what stuff's been brought in from the curb and that's the same thing from a landlord was ... what is available to me on that jak you put in my office and then\nI bet you unless for some reason they're the nicest landlords in the world and they just said\nYou know what we're going to pay all the attendance Internet access\nMost likely they'll say okay you have these choices\nI Would do some research to see what business and that cost and what you get what then happened\nIs they'll wired up they may or may not come into your office in wired up probably what they'll do is if you've got an Internet jak in your office they'll just ... what they do they call it lighted up\nThey'll connected in that closet there's all those ethernet jacks go into that closet and they'll connect that line in your office to the one that's coming into the building into the closet they'll connect those now you're on that company's Internet\nAnd then what you're going to probably have to do is buy a wife by router\nOh well that was going to shake Chili's we did that and and I found a company that was fired into their wives day with that necessarily be the why fight that they're\nNo that's right oh they offer you free why fine\nFor unlimited device\nNice that I is it from who's it from say curiosities it from the company that the rent you the building or\nYou know why it at that company puts it in the contract it up\nSo that might be all you need it depends on how fast it is there are things to be considering\nOkay we have an
