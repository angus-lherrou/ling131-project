looked like you know who you're matched right Birmingham seven hundred and Seventy miles or Seventy thousand seven hundred and something miles away so to get to see and experience that as a civilian\nHad lived in amongst with these people as they're doing their job protecting our freedom so we can be here today it's just really important and it's really special\nSort of get to tell that story here man\nCool yeah now does your wife throws much shade you as a major filtered in\nYou know [laughter] I Know where I'm standing right you know I'm Glad you guys got to fly with them and I'm I'm I'm so thankful for KFI being a media partner you're helping to reach everybody out on the boats and wherever they might be mostly so it's been fun thanks for having us on\nAbsolutely well I'm Glad I got to fight with them to thanks for inviting me gifts [laughter] that's the way it goes right you get sick Gary no\nNot at all I was I was telling a dean earlier the only time I felt\nNauseous at all which after everything was done and we're flying our way back making her way back from the Mojave Desert or towards Los Alamos it would just because I think part of it is the\nThe physical let down I Know that all the other stuff is done uh I'm physically exhausted you know pretty fairly ... during the during the ... it is it I mean the adrenaline the adrenaline thing is is a real absolute real deal and what's funny is funny I don't know that\nThat's the term but major fell through it was it was like driving to work for him it was like his daily commute I mean it's not it's not a big deal you know he had done the same thing a few hours before with uh with you know in other media member so for him it's just to just friday\nListen I don't want I don't want to take your time but but I Do want to point out two things that we have some amazing amazing performers here and I I Want to encourage everybody to listen to go down and see 'em for two guys that stand out to me on for two very similar reasons Mike whiskers and bill signed both they might get mad at me for saying this but the\nBoth of these men for cancer survivors and they're still doing this I mean you've lived through it yourself curious you know what I'm Talking about but the ... and Michael was just with Lucas Oil there\nTwo guys that should be inspirations to his own Mike whisked is he's really going to have him for this visit grandfather and he flies that airplane you know like a Nineteen year old kid so I I think everybody's going to really enjoy it and\nTo call them stump violence I don't think you know these are highly trained Arab addicts hardest men that can put the airplane exactly where they wanted for they want it to be and they can keep it there and it's just a it's an art form and I I Love watching these guys to him\nAnd they're asking planes to do things that planes shouldn't really be asked to do\nRight you know ... like to say people are just a breast the damn thing sly and uh we have to keep that in mind with these folks are doing this man is right at the edge of the problem it's just so ... so I Hope I Hope that translates today I'm\nThrough what we're talking about and just having fun and whatever I say that resembles the truth is you're going to make it out [laughter] you know so well to that I\nPut that in I mean as much as the the airplanes are doing things they're not doing it in a simulator they're actually in there doing it we were talking about the the physical manifestations of of that type of flying\nCan be very taxing on the on the body so you got these guys are in ... well after they're capable of doing these things and it is that I think is probably what I came away with was that appreciation for the physical toll that something like that can take\nRelatives awesome stuff and they're all athletes match happened that be the whole group stamping they use a young kid from Santa pollen jet bourbon with that redneck magnet just nuts [laughter] you know we had to airplanes sitting in the heck are not doing anything and he's like let's pulled them together and what the heck I'll put a jet engine that\nYeah I'm just gonna you know say this I just don't think he's stable\nYeah well if you if you knew Jeff and Jeff is actually what's interesting about you receive he's one of the the most put together guys you prevent\nSerious heat honestly

KFI for being one of the sponsors\nAre but we had a we had to count was over a million people last year and just under a million people the year before this is really got traction it's a regional show it attracts people from all over the state\nAnd or even the hotel guest registry shows people as far away as I really out of state we have a lot of Californians here\nAnd of course people from Orange County riverside and San Diego LA come here it's a real regional show that attracts people from all over it's incredible experience for hours of nonstop performance yeah it's a cat and this and I'm there every single day\nDay of every single air show I Love it\nAnd you have to be in Huntington Beach to get a real I mean look you could be in seal beach and here's some of the planes or in Newport Beach but unless you're in Huntington Beach you're not going to hear the PA announcer you're not going to see that when the plane while you're doing their stunts you got to really be in Huntington Beach\nThat that's right Tim you got to be on the sand and it's even come there\nAre free and if you want to listen to the to the play by play a play you can down her or download the I've heard radio weapon gets to play by play action over the radio and listen to it so if you can't have your little bit far from the speakers\nUm so it's free on the beach there's going to be chalet along the beach so he could have a preferred seeding food and beverage you can get preferred sitting on the pier thirty dollars that they were the ticket starts with a pair and they go up from you know to wherever you want to go to a painting of what your food and beverage preferences and what your what your shelter accommodations with the preferred like\nBy the way how did you guys at the uh the great Pacific Air show how long have you been doing this\n[laughter] we've been doing it this is the third year and what's exciting about this year is that code for which is a Huntington Beach based business he does a event promotions Kevin Eliot he's the president\nUm he does promotions and he's really an expert at this and he took over the air show kind of it the last minute or just for some negotiations with the previous owner is done as sort of bring it to the next level and get it a national presence\nAnd really bring the expert case of event planning a to the show what he's done in the last four or five months of preparation is nothing short of incredible\nThis is a money maker for you guys you make any money off this thing\nWell you know last year we think we did uh we had we we had a little bit of um oh some news where we we took some of the we elevated the parking tease we use the excess of the park to offset the increase costs to public safety\nAnd then we did a a little bit of a cursory dive on the economic impact of the city based on sales tax revenue increases the parking revenue increase in the transit occupancy tax\nAnd the hotels and we found a just within a quick glance that it might have been a three or four hundred thousand dollar net for the\nState and I was much more than that I bet it is next\nYear I Would like yeah next year after this show I'd like to get a do a real deep dive and really see what the economic impact is because if you think of two million people coming here and a two million people spend twenty bucks apiece\nMost ... and I know well what is the you know is what is the newest hotel there is it the Pacific what's the newest one on the corner called\nYou got to do it I did the sixteen on friday or oh my God very not sixteen I couldn't even imagine I was in a little piece shooters but you know doing circles and stuff like that but just a just an absolute thrilled over here how was it for you\nOr my arm a store from ... you know it's\nYou know the hot tub blast I kind of workout underwear cannot get everything\nYou know he's going to be wearing his flight suit this next week at least\nGiving new meanings is your definition of joystick exactly what I'm saying\nYou know it was unbelievable I threw a video up if if people want to check it out um the video is on the the Gary and Shannon page it's also on all of our social media Facebook and Instagram and Twitter\nAre and it's I turned it down to about five and a half minutes of what was an hour long flight with ah with some number number eight major Brandon filter and he's the narrator also he's the advance pilots so he comes out here he'll be out here later this afternoon sort of talking to people through the demonstration as they're watching it um but\nAgain currently this video does not habits audio does not have audio settled cockpit please feel free influence on on tests to read and download Jerry's video that has their own audio to it and then send it back to it so that we can enjoy Mary's version you know and being very I I you know\nHaving done that last year I mean it makes me want to learn how to fly makes me want to kind of be a part\nOf this and there are others in our eye heart family but ah or on your talents like us that have actually gone on and you know getting their pilot's license to do that you guys ever think about that\nWhen I was twelve over a lot about it when I was well my my uncle had a small little ... that he owned and would fly back and forth he was a member of the air force for a long time as well and he just wanted he just kept the plane because he liked flying and he would uh you know they fly over from a\nCouple of hours drive away would take um Fifteen twenty minutes to fly into our little town and we'd hop on the plane and go out over the coast or something like that and that was the only ... I was the beginning of it that was the beginning of my uh love and appreciation I guess for airplanes but\nIt was a that that went away pretty quick when I realized that there was a pretty hefty cost\nThe long run [laughter] planes do costs money I understand uh\nSo I just don't think it's one of those things that I can give enough time to to get good at it and that's the only thing that scares me about the small independent aircraft is right you know I just barely passed my my uh my certification and now I'm up there\nAnd I run into trouble and cause you know most of the time when we hear there's been a crash or an issue with some small Cessna somewhere you know right where I read where where relatively inexperienced pilot has had to deal with something unexpected and that would be make\nRight exactly you know just your luck you remember the first time you flew I well if they\nWeren't even calling a John Wayne airport I was\nI was a Cub Scout\nAnd there was an air show or what is now the John Wayne airport there were no commercial jets flying in there\nBut they charge you eleven cents a pound for whatever your way to defend you wind up in a fight slang\nWhile the first time I ever flew I was ten eleven years old and you know my mom put this leather helmet on me and said have fun and I I think now about that plane that I got in and it just amazes me my my mom must have not want to be around I Survived I think unfortunately for her but\nWhat ... what a thrill\nTo just be in any kind of\nYou know plain especially where it's not open your loan and in a in an open cockpit\nNo the the closest I got was an F. sixteen I don't think\nThat even that on friday when I when I was a kid or my family had a relative we had relatives who lived in Oregon on a farm and ah we got hooked up with their crop duster and you talk about the opposite of Gary's right where you are to everything you said everything is so\nA regulated and ceremonial and this was you remember the guy or in a independence day yeah Randy quite yeah Randy equate that was pretty much the guy who first took me on my first why he was kinda like [noise]\nRicher neighborhoods All right and what you know we were literally I guess you taxiing down the dirt had you know when he said oh yeah there's a seatbelt there\n[laughter] you should\nYou know so well I was not getting a little\nSeatbelt or was it just to enroll or something that we're not really attached to any of the area was\nIt was kind of it was not a confidence inspiring experience\n... ... ... I mean those those pilots are insane in a wonderful way I mean the the ... extremely low flying the speeds and carrying the liquid and I I think that'd be a great experience\nAnd felt amazing to have that happen in just be completely exposed to the elements at the same time that was a whole including all jak decided yeah that was that was my favorite part really\nIs when we slow down after dusting of crop and a little of it fought back onto the plane with us so so great uh you\nKnow but I I did I wouldn't say that uh you know you're not outside a by plane style crop duster style with an app sixteen but the the canopy I mean it's a bubble canopy and you can see in the video that that I posted that you\nAre it's an unbelievable view of Los Angeles I mean you think about how all of us have flown into LAX Burbank Ontario John Wayne whatever it is but when you're in at seven thirty seven year and a D.C ten at you you're only looking out a tiny little window that's\nTen inches wide Eighteen Inches tall you only have that small view\nIt's still neat view but when you are above the LA basin\nAnd you can see everything I mean the window itself probably came about halfway down my shoulder halfway down my upper arm from their all everything is visible I mean beautiful blue sky on friday it was an incredible view you could see a Catalina I don't think we ever lost sight of cattle you know I mean it was just amazing and\nAnd you know I I didn't hear you describe it earlier but I mean were you doing\nAny loops yes roles and stuff like that I was ... I don't think any of the doubt ranked\nGet him started my exactly because here's where we're at now I'm I'm just coming to realize that you know from now on you know none of us have\nAirplanes stories to count that's yeah that's what it at this point and I guess I just told either either dusting story an actor and he's like well you know we weren't open to the air but now you know when you're in an F. sixteen yeah right right right right right right the canopy the view you've gotta\nBut if your co pilot a who was any good he would have done everything he could to get you did ... well that\nWay he said he wouldn't intentionally tried to get me to pass out because that you know ... they want to make sure that I have a good time so that I can talk about the air force and the and the thunder\nBirds in the fifty seven fighter squadron et cetera\nUm but there were definitely opportunities for me to pass out or you can feel it 'cause they're all absolute sensation that comes right or absolutely and I I passed out before never end and you know an airplane but I passed out before so I Know the sensation of sort of losing that you know your peripheral vision and that\nGoes down to that one little point of light and then you're out like why am I right down the street a rich trove that by the way I don't use it right here on yeah everybody's passed out there I think at least once um but yeah we did everything we did the barrel rolls we did they all around roles we did the loops the load gee loop the hygiene loop we did a maximum gee turn\nWhich exerted nine\nTimes the force of gravity on my body\nThat was a that was disconcerting to say the least\nUh and it was a a pressure that is a almost indescribable in terms of what it's doing to you you know the the it wants to suck the blood out of your head and send it to the bottom and that's when your lights go out but they teach you different ... different ways\nTo overcome the effects or at least try to temporarily the blood you hit the blood in your head or so that the lights don't go out 'cause you're no good back there if you know if you can't control your body now uh I'm thunderbirds wind today they are flying that they will be one of the last things that you see today\nBecause I Know that they were starting about eleven thirty and going till about four Fifteen yeah so in and where can I get a schedule of event\nWell that's a great question I'll give you mind if you're interested but\nThere then doesn't necessarily matter and I will I don't get to do on occasion you ... I don't want to miss the good stuff you will not miss a moment because they do a great job of making sure that every place up and down the beach here has a has access to the public address system and Matt jolly\nIs going to take everybody through each of the things introduce all of the different players described the airplanes describe what they're doing and cetera\nBut I think where the the thing to remember\nWe talked with Matt jolly about it we've talked with some of the other pilots about the\nThe effects that this has on their body and you think about you know when I'm going through a maximum nine gee turn in an F. sixteen I'm In the back seat and I'm ... I'm the rookie back there and I'm just trying to keep my I keep my eyes open basically the pilot in the front seat is doing the exact same thing\nHe's got to go through the same exact\nOf physical things to clinch up his muscles the big muscle groups as his thighs is abs his chest and do the breathing to make sure that he stays conscious as well obviously that would be you know less than ideal if he were to pass out\nBut but it I mean the physical told that it takes on ... on you to do these stunts in an airplane like this it's not a simulator it's not just some guy\nComputer playing a video game getting the plane to do things that he's asking his body to do those things as well and that's an amazing thing to do just imagine and think about while they're doing those those stunts out\nSo what would I Would ask you to do your veteran you can render a salute if you're a civilian\nTake your hat off put your hand over your heart and tell those young folks that are with us\nWhy we do this it was all status celebrate our great nation singing the national anthem today\nRight here in Huntington Beach a member of the council [noise]\nIt's a lovely it always entertaining this Joe hearty who was a teacher\nAnd today the singer of our national and so on the cue of their boss [noise]\nWe'll hear that song that we all know and love written of course [noise]\nAnd historic Fort McHenry just off the shores by a man by the name of Francis Scott\nKey he penned a poem [noise] after waking up and seeing the plaques Joe blind [noise] talked about the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air and if you go to Fort McHenry you could see him\nAnd believe me when I say this you'll get emotional when you realized that was where it actually happened\nToday the flags ...\nI'll be more stars on board [noise]\nWhat do you love this great lad like we all do\nLet's just stand up and sing this song together\nIt's Sunday Morning Huntington Beach welcome to the average Joe standby for the national and [noise]\n\n\n\n\nFood they can use\nThe\n... the ...
