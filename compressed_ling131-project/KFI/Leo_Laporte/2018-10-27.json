I don't work for less than ... percent of the Orioles when they went\nOn I Know are the reason I hung up on her is anytime you start talking\nOr the constitution says I have the right to happiness or safety or whatever other crap all or you want to throw into court your honor I have the right to happiness a a ... the judge is going to hear that incidentally uh the appeals court is not going to hear\nA factual situation is not going to hear I said this the cop said there's copies line that's not what the appeals court does\nThe appeals court merely talks about procedural issues evidence\nTalks about whether the wall was properly applied talks about whether there was a law in place at that point\nWas the infraction correctly written or not so uh she is so out to lunch I Hope she spent ten thousand dollars for an attorney I Hope so to fight the traffic nothing would make me feel better\nThan her spending that much money\nGod I Love it\nRight the zoos handle on the law K pacify Angeles Orange County and I already [noise]\nA devastating circumstance I'm testified at a live from the KFI twenty four hour newsroom eight people are dead after this morning shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh\nPittsburgh public safety director window his race says six other people were injured including for police officers\nWhat are they thinking [laughter] but the materials are so beautiful yes somebody in a chat room punter tabs St ... saying it's sports car read it is there is a yellow ... what the tech pundits are calling the banana phone\nUh there's also a coral color looks like pink to me that's what they should have called it that would have been a good name looks like ... to me there's a black or white and there's a kind of a baby blue\nBut honestly uh don't you put this in the case I mean seriously\nNo ... ... you know I have a I got the black iPhone tennis max and I'd just put it in a red case because I like read but it can't tell what color the phone is if you put it in the\nCase and your ... and you got to oh this is um\n[noise] so what are you given up for\nYou know saving two hundred bucks for two hundred fifty bucks you're giving up the beautiful old led ... screen of the iPhone a tennis and the tennis max\nCan't tell the difference and if you ... if you've not had life on ten you won't tell the difference because it's if you had an LCD screen all this time and Apple's saying oh it's a really good LCD screen\nSo don't don't feel left out that's okay [noise] the other\nYou will give up and that's kind of unfortunate is the dual camera on the back\nIt's got a single camera and I took a few pictures or last night and you know the I guess the only thing you can do portrait mode you can do a lot of the a lot of the things that the ah ten ask can do or the ten can do\nIn the front facing cameras as far as I Know are exactly the same so if you if you know the selfie cameras the same it's the back camera but\nI think the really the main thing you miss there's two things one is of course the telephoto lens you can't do that optical two ex assume that you can do\nOn a tennis and by the way I should point out many other companies phones this is I was a I looked at the wall way Pete twenty pro yet a couple of nights ago and it uh it has I think three at least at least three like lenses on it\nSo [laughter] but the one lens on the other hand the probably the best camera phone in the market today which is the pixel three XL has only one lens apple says well we don't have that optical zoom and we use that second lands uh for some picture improving\nTechniques you know so [noise] but a lot of the things that they're doing with a ten are\nLike the pixel shifting the Google's doing um make it okay make it I think it's perfectly fine I think\nAnybody who's coming from an older iPhone will be very happy with this has the same you know no home button anymore and the has the same kind of\nUm [noise] you know\nSwiping this is the new this is the new style for Apple when they were set of a home button you swipe bucks to go home and you swipe left and right to go to ... and all that stuff that's fine I can I can\nI like that I prefer that frankly so uh it's got a notch who cares and yeah it's got a little bit of a vessel not bad\nI think if you're if you're going to be buying an iPhone this season you might want to look at the town are you might say\nYeah\nThat might be the one save a little money seven hundred fifty dollars starting point again unless\nYou know unless you know you need you know more juice in here\nAnd apple you know this one does go to one twenty eight which the effort tennis as do not so they go straight to fifty six K. storage\nSo awful long stretch I I I like this is ... is a nice for a so now I have three phones [laughter] well for if you include the note [laughter]\nI don't know nine or I don't know what I'm gonna do with them all but\nAt least I can talk if you have questions about um I got to get them so you can ... so you're not going to answer your questions right\nEight eighty eight asked where that is my phone number you have questions about smart phones\nI you know I resisted this for years people wanted me to talk about phones and for a long time I did but after apple came out with you I from once he became computers it really is still tech right it's it's a computer in your pocket [noise] eight eighty two seven five five three six we could talk about\nThat or anything going on in your tech world there is a big apple event coming up Tuesday\nIn Brooklyn New York at the Brooklyn Academy of music oh boy\nApples going to announce I'm almost positive and mark Herman and blue at Bloomberg a bit has announced has and he knows he's got the best sources ever anywhere inside apple he has said well it'll be two new I pads\nThe pet pros it will be the ten and a half and the uh\nTwelve point nine although the to have to be closer to eleven\nHe says they will use type seat charging the lightning will\nRule [laughter] and he also says they'll announce yeah a a new ... book air a new low cost Macintosh under some one thousand dollar apple Macintosh and he says a new Mac many which will have people cheering because of Mac many hasn't been updated in four years\nI'll ... I'll be there watching not in they didn't they don't like me but I'll be I was going to go to Brooklyn anyway but I'll be watching from afar and talked about it next week\nOur show today brought you by remote PC if you need to access a computer windows machine or a Macintosh when you're away from home or the office I've got the perfect product for you it's called the remote piece the\nWay that you can easily access and securely your PC or Mac at home or office from anywhere even with your mobile device as if you're sitting in front of your computers like tele boarding ... works great for individuals with home offices or even for small to medium sized businesses partly 'cause it's so affordable plan started less than six dollars a month\nTo connect up to ten computers\nBut if you use the ...

Johnson\nOr there may be kind of as you know there may be ten thousand Facebook pages for an em Ali G Johnson and if it has the same pictures same profile picture it's almost impossible distinguishes\nSo that's the most likely scenario um the second most likely scenario is that they got hacked and as I said Facebook announced thirty million people were hacked due to a flood Facebook\nThey reset all those accounts so even though they had been hacked unless somebody used that opportunity to take the account over a if it's you know not and it's hard to get your ... although you know if you use a password like monkey one two three and easily gift password um that's also possible\nSo it might not be a bad idea to to contact that person out of badly on a phone caller message or email message and say hey just question do you know was this huge we have a conversation sounds like you know that it isn't so that's that's the case where you might say happened heck now have you been hacked unless you click the Lincoln downloaded something or were taken to a\nKind of fraudulent page no just getting a message is harmless but to be careful about links in these messages because they can link you know the bad guy wants to run a program is just so they can link to\nBush pages which programs impacted we'll report\nUp news on KFI\nAm six forty more stimulating tall\n[noise] break [noise]\nI have a live from the twenty four hour KFI newsroom at least eight people have been shot and killed at a synagogue in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh public safety director window his race says six other were injured including for cops\nAre very horrific crimes from one of the worst that I'm sure they're not going on for ... for the [noise] shooting\nHappened around ... eastern time at the tree of life congregation in squirrel hill Pennsylvania's attorney general says the shooting happened at a baby naming ceremony the suspect has been arrested and identified as forty six year old Robert ... hours a serial ... has been grabbed by police\nAnd now convicted sex offenders headed to jail for groping several women in corona prosecutors say he grabbed a woman's behind earlier this month and she was jogging in\nA park then ran to a nearby car and took off surveillance video help police tracking down officials say he'd been arrested just last year for doing the same thing to other women in the parking lot of shopping center the man will now spend the next six months in jail than three years\nProbation he's also expected to register as a sex offender with the state Monica ...

Oh yes yeah it's just\nDifferent people perceive colors differently and especially when the primary colors red green and blue are these very narrow bandwidth ah this this increases the chance of ...\nYou know now some people may say well that's not very important if I see red differently for somebody else seeing seeing red or maybe that's not so important but to those of us interested in accurate\nReproduction it it kind of is [noise]\n[noise] any way or the other thing I Want to make a point point year about this is as you know all too well technology always marches off so you\nBuy something at some moment in time and it's always it's always going to get out of debt is pretty soon you already quickly unless you can do about that not too much you can do about it you just you just jump in when you're ready and you enjoy what you get [laughter]\nProblem is it's these these these hundred inch TV so darn expensive you kind of want to get the best\nWell that's true you know this high senses ten grand yeah there's a lot um which which is a lot of money you know it it's not when you compare it to a hundred inch LCD TV right\nWhich would be more typically right I mean if if they even existed uh you could easily get into the five figures more ... more than the bottom of the five figures so uh you know it's it's it's a judgment call as usual Penn so much just like watching football on a big ... that out a big screen TV with a bunch of people\nWell and that's what these are better for it it's not a movie is that a home theater experience it so that is correct\nMy funniest thinking in buying one of these new ... and I'm kind of helping look out for a a a huge the player that ... that TV in the sense of being able to play every formats oh ... H. T. R. S.\nDolby ten and a ... you know yeah let me you know it's got ill I think's got still here it's got to you are you still here I Am still here I did you hear ah did you hear his questions questions sadly not can you ... Glen is I'm a his parents were buying which which TV as a Clinton\nYeah they are are they how they ... the ... masters who was the\nNew oh man that's off\nThough he wants to know what you H. D. player to get to go with it they will handle all the formats that the uh a good question so that's what I Do ... vision he told me it has an edgy are ten and there's a ... and there and I felt\nWell there's no no I'm actually used as well sort of um I Would say one of the Sony players probably I\nJust saw something I'm trying to remember now I Would I Would have said opposite but they've gone out of it they went into it was so sad because out of business but out of the ... they're not doing layer players anymore yeah exactly so\nI mean are your parents like to play video games\nThe players and X. box one no yeah but then you get you that you have to get the remote the regular TV type ... not that I ate\nThe game that I have a game controller we're not out of the uh DC or the or a license and you just have it but I I'm used to it doesn't bother me is is there another remote\nYou can get the remote the real probably I don't think it does I think it only to I Can't remember what standards I think it only does it does actually our tastes your ten I think they've announced Dolby Vision at some point it's a half or upgrade I Would say the next best is\nProbably the Panasonic um I forget the model number now but the top of the line Panasonic uh I'm pretty sure does ... yards and there'll be vision an HD are ten plus which is Samsung's answered the Dolby Digital it puts dynamic met a day to\nUse the dynamic edited and whether or not there'll be any discs in that format I don't know there aren't yet so some studios have\nClaimed they're going to but we haven't seen any yet but the Panasonic a ... D Blu ray player is probably the one I Would recommend\nNo I don't know uh it can you still buy Panasonic into us\nAh yes Blu ray players yes TVs no they've gotten out of the TV business in the U. S. but they're big in Europe and Asia seem since you've got a Sony TV you should just get a Sony well that's there is some a logic to that absolutely yeah absolutely\nYeah I was looking at a they have three models currently uh they ... they actually found it on seven hundred and um but I was hesitant because I was looking to specks on on the website and uh I was not a hundred percent certain that they weren't going to be able to support older aged or former it's particularly the ones that do um dynamic H. D. R.\nAnd all those those two are W vision and ... and plus and the uh I'm pretty sure Sony is not on board with H U R ten plus uh I Know Panasonic is Panasonic\nPanasonic BP you'll be eight twenty is the model number\nLast ... last week you mentioned perhaps ... with the child when I bought a pioneer a ...\nYou know I yeah I just saw that I just saw an email that they had come out with a new player and I haven't looked at it yet so I Can't really tell you the recommended or not yet because I haven't looked at it but um they did come out with a new one let me also you can find a real quick ...\nPlus his Samsung thing to some idiot Sonia to master class habits or a no master series ... ... ... you're not you know at the same ... so the whole point worrying about that right exactly exactly okay to do something\nElse I wanted to know if I'm\nYou know the way that ... implement saw H. D. R. S. is a little bit different than ... L G ... also like they have a a district a chip for a you know they'll be patient and the older and a Sony also like to software so like they have a very powerful um\nYou know troops it and uh the interest so for a for an update there would be able to play a bully beach in an older formats\nDo you think that's going to be something that they will implement a it but they could implement in the future um\nDo you mean do you mean like HBO and plus right\nYeah they could whether or not they will is that is another real problem because you know Samsung\nMakes they feared and plus so Sony's not going to implement it\nSo our global vision because I mean there's only so many Samsung doesn't support there'll be ... correct that is so that is really have to I mean it's crazy crazy crazy it is and it sounds\nLike the answer your question of land is get that Panasonic with that nice Sony TV man that's the only TV it's gonna be awesome yeah that's really really good\nIt's it's just nuts what ... what are you know why do they do to us\nGuy yeah you know I don't know I Wish I did you know there's there's format wars there's all kinds of weird stuff about like as you say Samsung for some reason just did not want to adopt there'll be vision everybody else did but they didn't\nHave our own however if I'm going to look pretty good rice really good okay I mean you know if this tiny difference\nOh well there's I think there's a difference between W vision and H. E. R. ten which do you like better believe it I don't question okay no question so I'm looking here I I don't I'm looking at the the specs of the Sony you you'll be P. X. eight hundred and I don't see a where it says\nHere let's look at features I'm pretty sure it does there'll be ... I'm not a hundred percent sure but I'm pretty sure it does it does at most certainly\nI don't see it mentioning Dolby Vision which they would they would make a big deal of it if if it did really well I'm a little surprised at that\nI Would say than ironic get it in the ... so I understand Glen Glen called\nReally thank\nGoodness you're here Scott Wilkinson home theater geek or show to seize oh it's like a minefield out there I show they brought you buy a car but I'd hear at least if you're in business at least you can rely on carbon I for data protection\nIt's kind of a nice feeling to have a single vendor one place you go that that can protect your data and all kinds of weather\nAnd when I say whether I mean all situations whether it's server backup local hard drives on premise servers virtual machines carpet the perfect choice for business wants one place to come call one number\nOne vendor to cover all their needs\nReal time replication and cloud fail over means you've got high availability that's important for business that means you're up and running almost instantly so you lose no revenue every minute down is of course revenue lost you get back up in recovery for physical virtual cloud based environments for over two hundred operating systems applications\nAnd platforms of course encryption enterprise grade encryption end and\nTrue global the duplication if you\nHave ... points you loved their endpoint solution\nAnd you always want one vendor because that means when disaster strikes no matter what it is whether it's ransomware acts of God's human error you've got one place to go to get it back and get back to business card but it is a secure trusted provider offering award winning customer service seven days a week learn more about carbon I'd stay to protect your platform for business\nA carbon I.

T. dot com\nWell today was a home theater guy right will go back and we'll go back to the phones and answer questions on any subject smart watches we can talk about you know I was a I talked to some people from Wall way the other night they were at an event showing off they're really nice while way a mate\nHe replied actually I actually said don't\nGive it to me on the phone I don't want it on the phone as good as these phones are supposed to be [laughter] uh\nMake most people I think we assume our our iPhones are are secure\nThe way I can only speculate how it would be a hacked but I can tell you how a iPhones at all phones are routinely hacked and we know it it's very common in Washington DC it's with a device colloquially call the sting re\nSing razor widely used by law enforcement but they can be easily made and easily made by you know spies we know there are many many ... raised in Washington DC\nI'm One of the uh one of the um\nTech blogs drove an expert around town with some equipment and was able to identify dozens of the many of them close to embassies what does this thing they do\n\nIt or it impersonates they sell site so you know that your your\nCell phones pretty permissive gifts [laughter]\nThan here in lies the problem it will just joined a cell site the nearest strongest cell site saying yeah yeah yeah that's what I Need I Need a connection to the world it is possible to impersonate a cell site for any major carrier\nHave the phone joined it as if it's a real cell site and there are a couple of things you could do one at some point I guess you could you could pass that phone call on to a real cell site so really you're just doing what we call a man in the middle attack\nIn which you can eavesdrop on the conversation the data and so forth\n[noise] um [noise] if\nThe president or somebody in the White House or somebody in Congress was using a stock iPhone\nIt would be a trivial process to put a sting right near that area and pick up the cell phone conversations now it's my understanding is that these are encrypted so I'm not sure eggs I Do know that the sting rays are used by law enforcement so there must be a way to the crypts is\nAnd I presume if there is such a thing\nUm [noise]\nThat that would be used in D.C there are many many of the sting race in DC I also presume the secret service routinely sweeps the area of the White House for sting rays\nSo\nI'm not sure how effective the monitoring would be the real problem in the cell phone network and the real insecurity in all smartphones is with the radios the\nBase spanned radios and something called S. S. seven signaling system seven it was developed in Nineteen Seventy five is still\nUsed in all smartphones is how smart phones make phone calls\nAnd it has been cracked many times and the techniques\nFor cracking ss seven are well known so it it isn't just so you know it is it hard to listen in on a smart phone call if you're ... you're significantly\nWell equipped funded and you're smart and that's what protects us because no one's going to do this on mass it only works with targets and that's why it's so dangerous\nOr for the for the president or anybody government to use a stock cell phone because they are targets and so somebody can camp out outside the White House and a and intercept phone calls or follow the president's limousine and so forth\n[noise] um there have been prop proposals to make ss seven secure\nIt hasn't happened yet\nIf you are concerned about getting spied on don't make phone calls on the stock phone\nDon't use text messaging SMS messaging instead use something encrypted now you could use Facebook's WhatsApp which is we are as we understand it will encrypted but I Would suggest using something that's not owned by Facebook or any other\nCompany but instead something called signal which is known to be secure in open source a messaging protocol and you could use that to make phone calls data phone calls and\nA text messages securely and as far as I Know that without being slipped upon [noise]\nI don't think the president's using signal but it's possible he could and could even be using it on the stock I phoned making secure calls\nSo this is a this is a significant issue in a an operational security would require that the people in the government or people who are targets which would include by the way CEOs of tech corporations because a lot of the spine that goes on the United states even from\n... countries like China and Russia really aren't necessarily political in nature\nA lot of them are industrial there's they're stupid for secrets for patents for competitive information because they want to echo do economically well particularly from China so if you read the story and you were concerned well gosh I felt my iPhone was secure no phone is truly secure\nBut there are ways to make it secure without having the secret service modify it\nAnd one of those ways is not to use the telephone network
