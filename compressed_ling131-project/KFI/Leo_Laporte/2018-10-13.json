{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "\nYou know\n\nBack to camp I Am\nWe'll handle here this is\nA handle on the law marginal legal advice [noise]\nHey Bob welcome to handle on along yeah\nYeah I was arrested and went to jail and um my girlfriend at the time had a friend who bailed me out I did not enjoy anything 'cause I didn't have the money to do it\nBut I was bailed out by them by him actually um I did at the latest and back a week later when we met the bail bonds when I had to sign papers him if the bail bondsman no that yeah fire who I Am and blah blah blah [laughter]\nAnyways uh the guy built his suing claims court and I don't know you know what kind of gave I haven't been encouraging I'd never signed did they pay for everything\nI Know how much how much how much money did die he uh pay for the bail\nTwenty five hundred right\nSo effectively what you're saying is since I never signed any papers I shouldn't have to pay\n[noise] well I didn't say that I told them at some point I Would try and write and it's been a while\nIt was you know you want to go but anyway so I always tell me so I'm like well I don't know what you know\nOr whatever you know you're going to go to court and your defense is is we have no agreement and I told him I Would pay him\nBack when I could and as a matter of fact when he painted we never had an agreement at all there is no sign contracts\nSo the argument you can make is this a friend of yours or is it that well\nMy ex girlfriend I mean I knew who\nHe okay then then you're arguing defense is is that he did it for the benefit of his girlfriend\nAnd ah that's that's going to be your defense whether the judge buys it or not I have no idea\nUh your point of Iraq if I'm the judge I'm going to set up some kind of a payment schedule however I technically I mean he's going to sue you and he wants the money now and you don't have it\nIs a judge to grant him a a a judgment maybe I who knows what a judge is going to do in small claims court but you have some just defenses saying hey I thought it was a gift\nHe never said anything I'd ever asked to be paid back my girl friends said I have a range\nOr bailed demean made where you are and are there you go\nAnd as far as you're concerned it was a favorite of her she's the one that put it up because of a relationship you once had there was any number of defenses but ... what you have to do is go to court and what you have to do is defend yourself and say number one no agreement ever odd varies ... there was never worried about me paying\nIt back I had always assumed I had always assumed that this was given to me because of my relationship with the ex girlfriend okay it was a\nGeneral again obviously I Wonder if I don't do I go to jail\nNo no you know go to jail there'll be a judgment against you that's all\n[noise] what do you collect it I mean\nI think that there you go that's exactly the point if you have no money\nAnd they have no assets I he can't collect it\nI mean what are you gonna do you're right it can you go to jail of course he can throw you in jail debtors prison you know when debtors prison win out just about I think in the Seventeen hundreds is when they got rid of debtors pressing the United states\nAll right All right so uh those are the defenses I mean it's really easy yet when do I often say get it in writing get it in writing get it in writing\nHello Bob\nAnd the handle on law [noise] yes hello yes go ahead\n[noise] yes [noise] I I was involved in an accident automobile accident and I met her claim or to the other parties insurance company\nAnd that and that has more to want to go and they are still investigating yeah ... is there any statute of limitation\nYeah there is what you're yeah there is but you're way way way before the statute and if they don't want to go beyond that how much damage to your car\nBob but\nThey're just suit a guide for small claims court in three thousand dollars just to see a\nGuy not the insurance yet what did the insurance company didn't hit you\nYes okay so so I I I actually was a guy\nYeah yeah you assume and then and then the insurance company may jumping uh because uh that's what he pays for his insurance and they can sit there and go we're investigating were investigating two months of investigation has kind of a long time\nSo what I Would do is write to him and first say hey listen get the insurance company involved in this I mean a lot quicker than it is otherwise I'm simply going to sue you in small claims court and I'll collect out I'll just go after you forget about your insurance\nOkay that's all you have to do and not not a big deal\nAll righty I'm Melissa Hi Melissa\nYes Hi I'm\nDone they'll say [laughter] I went to a legal somewhere

but I said to my mom because we talk over face time I said when I send you this camera fire ranch that absolutely\nNot what are you crazy what even that's not even on Facebook [noise] never mind it's\nGot a a there was an opinion piece in the New York times by a kind of a\nLegendary security guy a lecture at the Harvard Kennedy School and the security grew Bruce Schneier or about his the headline Internet hacking is about to get much worse oh boy [noise] and then I realized well that\nTitle isn't even as scary as the title of the book is just put out click here to kill everybody [noise] security and survival and it connected world\nSo that this is one of the great security gr is out there and he's basically saying\nIt's you know it's over unless we sit down as a as a country as a nation as a as a globe and say we're gonna we're gonna start to force companies to be secured they they won't he said we've got we've\nTo regulate our choices no longer he writes in the times between government regulation and no government regulation\nRegulation is inevitable but we have to choose between smart and ill advised government regulation is not something to fear regulation doesn't stifle innovation in fact\nWell written regulation will spur innovation creating new markets for security technologies he's basically saying that companies have no incentive to make their stuff's secure it just costs money there's really no pay off\nYou can you get punished and the press but look at Equifax that huge breach fourteen million records all of our private information financial information leaked out and did they pay a fine no\nThey got a little you know being in the press and then went on with business in fact actually I think they made money 'cause then they [noise] they told everybody all you need credit monitoring and we'll be glad to sell that to you\n[laughter] [noise] unbelievable [noise] ah there is a U.S this this title click here to kill everybody actually uh\nProbably\nA little uh him politic right now because\nWell there's a big story in the news you probably heard about a the a Saudi Arabian journalist who has disappeared and the Turkish government says democracy hoagie was tortured and murdered\nIn the Saudi embassy in Istanbul\nAnd we know they say we're a hundred percent certain because and this is the technical ... knowing that he was probably at risk\nOr an apple watch when he went into the embassy of Saudi embassy and turned on recording and had the recordings sent to his phone\nWhich was outside the embassy and apparently recorded his arrest and murder I don't think you can see that one of the apple ad\n\nThey talk a lot about how to save lives I don't think [laughter]\nI think that is still fascinating\nActually CNN now saying that maybe that maybe it didn't happen quite that way\n\nBut it's not so far fetched does it I mean it could have happened that way whether it did or not is not the issue\nBut I ended up you know there's a there's an app I've used all the time a lot of journalists use it on your apple watch called just press record\nRecords audio on your apple watch kind of surreptitiously right and you don't have to hold the watch of just you're wearing it records the audio and then\nUh download your phone or at a ... you know after a little bit of time\n\nOr the CNN says it's probably didn't happen because of data an apple watch with the LT data the kind that Apple's been selling for the last couple of years uh won't Rome in another country won't get out to eat it at other country I'm not sure that that's true I think it's more complicated than\nThat but uh but it's it doesn't matter really doesn't that's not the point the point is that it's just a matter of time before somebody does that you can't do that I have this\nBig red button that can press on my watch actually I have a little red button 'cause it's a complication so it's a little tiny red button and the vice president

moon well I guess that's kind of an ancillary story so there's\nYeah I had to say I'm going to say this right away you may enjoy the movie yeah but it just it's really sad and ... I was so upset about it I wrote a blog post when I got home because I feel like\nThey shouldn't let Hollywood touch modern history and history 'cause they just mowing set up and it was it was more about and I don't even know if this is true the Neil Armstrong's inability to communicate and say he loved his children yeah and it was about the most important exploration and scientific achievement of\nOf our lifetime and it probably the millennium maybe of all time and landing\nBringing a mom and that's right that's right I was totally disappointed at that too although I have read that uh some of the interactions in particular when Neal arm when Neil Armstrong's Wife says you must tell your kids that you might not be coming back\nThat apparently was close to verbatim according to his sons\nWho were there when when he told them that but in any event I still it is that the most important part about landing a man of the moon Armstrong was an astronaut he\nHad the right stuff he wasn't a big talkie levine touchy feely guy so what yeah exactly and he will either way what yet the hugely dignified guy after he walked on the map so literally where he's much higher life he passed away a few years ago\nAnd in in in every respect loved and respected by everyone and he didn't he didn't get all nutty about it he just would did his job and that's what you wanted an\nAstronaut and either way there's a scene in the movie at the at the end I don't want to spoil anything\nWell how can you spoil it it's we know what happened\n[laughter] no no but he does this thing at the end it never happened they made up oh you know with a man with the bracelet ... never had oh right that was completely made up\nThey ... they gave this guy who is not a great director he got a lot of accolades in almost won the best actor best movie award except he didn't like her la la la la la la land Damon ...\nShould never give it to him give it to Ron Howard did an amazing job with a pilot or Thirteen was much better give it as this Elbert or give it to some Tom Hanks give it to somebody who can make the the right movie\nNot this guy he made it la la land for the moon I mean\n[laughter] there's no there there's always\nSinging and dancing but the music when they're doing the moonscape is kinda crappy\nI agree I totally totally agree with you I was not happy with the music I was not happy with all of the hand held\nFast with well that's another thing I Want to ask you because you saw an IMAX I just thought that was yeah it will be theater which is very very nice yeah and it's really when they're when they're getting launched if the if there's there are some good things to this movie and one thing is\nI don't know how accurate it is but if if that's what it feels like getting launched wow [laughter] I Know I Know shaky that the rockets banging like stuffed banging like it's falling apart\nYeah yeah and in some ... immersive sound is amazing no question about\nI'd have hated to see an IMAX though you saw it\nAs I did and the reason I did was that most of the movie is in an aspect ratio that's typical for movies called to point three five to one which means the with the images to point three five times wider than it is tall\nBut then during the moon the lunar scenes after they actually land on the moon the aspect ratio\nA ... gets taller or and if you go see it in an IMAX film theater which there are only a few it really gets taller I didn't see that I saw I saw it at a in an a laser IMAX the Chinese theater in Hollywood the famous Chinese theater and\nIt it opens up a little bit\nAnd it's meant to make the moon vistas look more dramatic\nAnd I'm sure it does it did a little bit ... when we went from two three five to one point nine and so it got a little taller and a little more impressive but only in the last few minutes\nOf the movie it it wasn't worth it to me and I wish I had seen it and do the cinema because the shadow detail of which there's a lot\nIn this movie uh was not very good yeah and the IMAX presentation I saw so there were many things to complain about technically the sound was not one of them sound was beautiful um [noise] but I I Wish I had seen it in an IMAX that really opened up at the end but I'm afraid that would not have saved a movie for\nMe it was still pretty bad like when they do stuff like that kinda takes me out of the film I mean yeah it does yeah you know suddenly you're aware of the fact that oh there's a ... I'm watching a movie and I just I Would do that kind of gives gimmicky stuff\nWell in some cases it's effective yeah but I you know Ryan Gosling just looking pen serve out into space so much it's just like come on\nAnd Neil Armstrong really sound like he came from Minnesota yeah sure you betcha [laughter]\nActually when I first of all he's from Wisconsin second of all that accent came and went and

because he just won't say\nHe's going to the moon to the boy they just want to\nDo I [laughter] so angry yeah yeah it was ... and also there were so much silence and ... as they're waiting to blast

district had teachers strike was in Nineteen eighty nine [noise]\n\nThat's at a plant purple an extension in Beverly Hills here in the original plans were the one the subway underneath Santa Monica boulevard which would have been several hundred feet\nFrom the school they're worried construction will be dangerous for students but ... says they wouldn't build the project that would be harmful\nWe've done our due diligence we've done our environmental work the project is federally certified it's been upheld in state court\nThey're just eating them alive at all newspapers are suffering because of it but the but it seems like only the wall Street Journal really wants to get Google back for it so they\nWrote an article that really uh was gazing about Google they called it a breach they said that Google Plus\nThey they found out they found the emails that Google Plus had a flaw that allowed a third party programs to access your Google Plus profile information\nEven if it was mark private knowledge when that came out I looked at my Google Plus profile and ... there's no credit cards they're the only thing you put their you know there were two things I had private my home address what that to get out in my personal cell phone number and and went back to get out but it's not\nThe end of the with all like to get my Social Security number my credit card you don't put that on your Google Plus profile is essentially a public profile with a few private field I think the I Can't even remember ... plus it's so old now but\nI think the private fields were for friends and family only that kind of thing so some outside party got information than I intended only for friends and family and by the way Google\nWhen\nConfronted with that said well okay so we found it in may we had no evidence that anybody had figured this out words using it so we fixed it and that that and this happens all the time Microsoft fights laws and windows all the time they don't necessarily\nVila they fix it if if nobody gets bit by they fix it and until GDP our went into effect later in this year a nobody had the same thing about it I don't know if Google would have a duty to disclose now\nBut it was no breach that's the key in my Wall Street journal initially they changed the headline later called it a breach a breach implies that somebody got and then got that data but there was no evidence that it wasn't a breach it was a software flaw\nWhich happen all the time was fixed maybe Google should have told the world I don't know you can debate that Google and as I I don't know if it's related but a Google says they are doing an entire route and branch that's what they call it\nA survey of all of the stuff they do to make to let third party developers use Gmail or Google Plus or any of\nAny of their stuff you know you can you can sign up for a system and given permission to go through your gi mailed it but like trip it which I use for planning it will look at my Gmail and look for\nUm [noise] cut confirmations from the\nAirlines and hotels and they make a temporary for me on trip it\nAnd I like that I turn that on I think that's a nice feature [noise] ah people some people don't like it but of course you have to turn it on Google says we're going to make sure everything's doing it right and we're only allowed people to go through the mail if it has a male application right in fact I think that's going to probably impact trip but they also said and now that we found out there was a problem with Google Plus even though we\nDidn't tell you we didn't think it was a big deal we fixed it may we're going to close Google Plus anyway [laughter] [noise] which\nNo I don't think many people are shedding a tear over there are a few people my French Trey Ratcliffe is very famous photographer and really a use Google Plus the great advances one of the things Google Plus was Google's social network you may not even know I think people don't know part of the problem what to do with it is that if you have a Gmail account if you have a Google Account you have a Google Plus account\nIt's kind of automatic as kind of a problem but you don't have to set up\nA full profile or use it it's just you have an account if you want one but one of the things it was great about Google Plus has a display photos beautifully I mean really nice job\nAnd so photographers like trade Ratcliffe another's used it and became famous ... had more than a million followers and Google Plus he had drove a lot of traffic I think it helps him become a household name among photography buffs\nHe's actually a putting together a show of people saying good bye [laughter] the Google Plus a little premature Google Plus is going to be here through August of next year but I thought that was an interest in reaction OK Wall Street journal [noise] if you're gonna ding us for something that we didn't really ...\nWe're just going to close it down so there were taken our ball and going home\n[noise] I think most people don't mind because if you've been on Google Plus lately has really fallen places really falling apart social networks do not do well if neglected have you noticed that it's like a garden the weeds start to grow\n... trolls do this ... stuff and that forces out the good stuff people God I Want to go there anymore pretty soon after you neglected long enough all you gotta wage\nThere's still some good stuff on Google Plus it's not all weeds but I think it's probably time to shut it down I don't really blame Google for doing it it's just a shame that it was a ... girl is peace in the wall Street Journal that triggered the whole thing [noise]\nLet's go we go back to the phones just to say I'm Sorry I I get I get all headed up about stuff and I
