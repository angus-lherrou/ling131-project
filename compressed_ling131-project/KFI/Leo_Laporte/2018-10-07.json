Shannon\nEvery Friday this Friday eleven thirty per huge having fun bringing in toys version and to play with and to learn how to become the building master that she secretly is All right [noise] you're home a dean sharp the house whisper we been talking about alternate homes today\nI Hope it's been an interesting conversation uh for you I Hope you've learned a few things I've got some final thoughts on the straw bale homes which is what we were talking about before the break a pros and cons of is one thing you need a that's a con in this situation if straw bale building codes are not\nPart of your local code ordinances it it could be a bit of work to get your plans approved or they are approved\nIn the international a residential code uh like we said the appendix ass is there but that doesn't mean that your city has been studying them or even thought about adopting them for use in your municipality\nOr the other thing that should be self evident is the straw bale walls need to be kept\nDry and we've probably learned the most about straw bale about housing in general uh from straw bale houses in this\nArea of moisture protection water proofing drainage vapor barriers and so on\n'em because once the moisture gets in there were there any openings in the straw bale wall you've got the potential of mold insects rodents those guys have got to be kept out they're not going in there to eat the straw because like I said straws not hey it's not food for anybody\nOr they're going in there because it's nice and cozy and comfy and warm and they're going to live although or I should say\nA um [noise] uh insects termites will eat straw\nJust like they would but the rodents the roads are just going to go in there and make a house inside your well All right\nUh again they're not necessarily cheaper to build dinner traditional house if you don't build it yourself so this needs to be a passion project for you sealing the walls has to be bomb proof\nAnd you have to have the room on the property for the additional square footage 'cause every single one of your walls is Eighteen Inches thick at minimal so that's going to suck up a lot of interior square footage unless you make the overall footprint of the house larger\nWhat can we learn from straw bale houses is there really any difference between strong would ultimately no\nIt's just a different way of doing it and the lessons of water proofing in vapor ceiling and protecting should be lessons that we learn for every single house at all times All right we're going to have to revisit this I'm\nNot necessarily alternate homes which the media has a trumped up a lot but ah alternate building process is for traditional home so we're going to we'll do a show where I talk about passive homes structurally insulated a panel home steel start homes gonna try and cover all of that but uh hopefully\nToday we've given you something to chew on in regards to those building processes which are\nYou know different alternate is only alternate until it becomes mainstream right\nSo I mean to leave you with this thought today we are a naturally fearful species we do fear pretty well may be better than we do anything\nAnd one of the chief ways that we manifest our fear is by Rick oiling from what is new and what is different and if you're not an artist or or a make or or somebody who's tried to do something original or innovative than you may not know how terrifying it can be to do new\nOr how judgmental plain old ordinary folks can get just because something is different but it's no joke\nWe are creatures driven by our stories we see the world through our stories we make sense of life by filtering it through our stories we take shelter in our stories but worst of all we often stop questioning our stories and we get stuck in them\nAnd when someone comes along with a news story a different story have no doubt\nThat per person will be feared and judged and ridicule or at very least ignored\nSharp family is full of creative and artists and makers of all sorts and shapes we understand the terror of being us so we have a rule in the sharp family and for the house\nWas per design studio as well and it's this do not be quick to judge fresh new ideas\nCreativity can and does change the world that's power but when a creative thought a new thought a different kind of thought is in its infancy very fragile it's vulnerable\nIt's terrified of coming out in the light of day so that's our rule it's a rule because we can just as easily forget it as well and let our fear shut us down\nCreativity and innovation needs caretakers they need nurseries to grow in they need nurses to help them develop\nAnd yes most new ideas aren't the best idea rarely do we get it right the first time out of the gate but if we don't live in an environment where it's okay to get it wrong then we'll never get out of the gate at all\nAnd even new ideas that are destined to fall short of mass appeal and ... and give birth to other ideas which will in fact change the world\nAlternative is only alternative until it becomes mainstream and then it changes the world the home you're living in right now was once an alternative style of construction\nIs no one way we'll build houses in the future because variety is the spice of life variety diversity alternative homes alternative wives new ideas new ways of doing things their heart is the challenge our stories\nAnd they stir up here but they're exactly how the world moves forward [noise]\nBeing open to change [noise]\nWill change

good on fifty six of sixty six feel gold attempt coach land thing this week sometimes it's just chemistry between the two guys\nDrew was outstanding punter it was a hard time but you look at the big picture his job is also to hold just wanted to change the whole dynamics right now he said with the holder and the kicker and see if we can make an extra point that would be good\nJohnny Jones is also we should know one of the game's most reliable partners he's been in a league Fifteen season the thirty eight years old does that sound familiar yes well Philip Rivers was pick number four overall back in two thousand four Donny jumping taking in the seventh round about draft\nActually play together in a senior bowl all five hundred years ago he averages forty five point five yards for Chinese

takes a nap\nHe wakes up from his mid afternoon nap to a bunch of missed calls from his agent and the rest\nIs really history he's called this week hectic crazy if getting used to the time change but

I ... I Need to extend my wife fight so that I can get a\nFire sticks or something like that for the other team east right and they can uh do it but I don't know what kind of range extender I Need or there's a better brand or main\n[noise] yeah this is my thing uh uh the most out the whole thing to be the wire the whole house ... horse but who's going to do that nobody was on the addict yeah yeah yeah of course yeah I\nI keep I'm tempted to do that in my house in the crawl space underneath here in California we tend to be you have no basements but at least we have little crawl spaces underneath but then who wants to go under there that's even worse me addict [laughter] lighter so a horse\nOr worse the cable companies took advantage of the FCC when the FCC made over the television stations go digital some years ago and I remember there was a big thing about it and you had to get a digital to her and stuff the cable companies pretended\nThat this was a requirement for them to and took advantage of and they all went digital or there's advantages for them they can get more a signal down the line you know analog uses a lot more bandwidth than just getting digital packets on there so you get more channels et cetera et cetera et cetera\nBut of course at this point I'm ... everybody's looking for is to just do it over the top that's called when you use the Internet to get your television they call it over the top\nOr you're going over and over and above your cable companies own offerings and TV saying I'm going to do it myself on a fire t._v. or Roku or an Apple TV or you know YouTube TV or whatever\nBut they do that you need first of all good Internet I presume you're getting that at the router and then that Internet needs to get to all the other\nTVs in the house and that can sometimes be Alan Nash\nExactly it's not terrible my daughter uses her laptop in the back room and streams some stop but there's a lot of buzz spring\nYeah what you'll notice on why fight the farther you get the less signal you get and thought I signal you get the less speed you get the direct correlation so\nWe want to boost the signal bell ah it depends on what you're using as a wife I access point if you're using a modern access point there has to do Lebanese see are you\n[laughter] you're ...\nMike yeah but yeah how recently did you by your accent or however you spent a decent\nWhy why it's not DSL um [noise] it's just that uh they also have the the the lock on that as well we're very we're also the only choice we had\nOh it's from the cable guy I got it yeah yeah that makes it more complicated now what I Would recommend and most cable companies will let you do this I don't know if yours will ... cable company but if if they do the best thing to do is to use their cable modem and provide your own wife five router\nI did I did do that\nYeah okay good so you ... if they if they're cable modem has a wife by a part part of it you know a router part of it just disable bad or at least turn off the wife five radio\nIf you could turn off the wife by radio that'll lemonade signal congestion and then you have to put the wife I rather than what we call bridge boats they let the uh cable modem router because it's still around her and they decide what IP address as we all get but I'm going to use you for why fight that usually works pretty well\nYour best way to do this is with the more modern mesh why fire routers um euro sponsor of ours is a big name but there are plenty of these or be for next year a veil up from is that links is I can never remember\nThere's a there's a whole bunch of strange names for these things\nAnd these ... are designed for challenging why fire environments they have a base unit\nSometimes the same as all the other units sometimes different from all the arguments and then they have some units\nTypically you buy a a a little sub unit for every Fifteen hundred square feet although you if you have a challenging environment with multi levels that kind of thing you might might buy more and and these these little extra units are are like repeaters but they're better than so you can get a repeat or for your existing non meshed system\nBut what will happen is the repeaters takes half of the time talking to the route the base station\nThe other half the time talking to you so we\nAll wife I extenders cut wife I speed in half while at the nature\nOf a wife like standard because they can't operate in what we call full duplex smoke they can't they can't do two things at once they can only either talk to the red or talk to you so that's split in half\nThe ... have a back channel this is the ... the main difference have a back channel they use to communicate with the base station it doesn't slowed down so the ... and his wife the best solution for somebody who's trying to expand their wife by footprint\nAnd plume is another one that's uh that's I use both plume an arrow in my house there are lots of companies all you have to look for ... um\nThe problem is the expense because you're not only buying a base unit you're going to buy one or two or three extra extenders in the end they usually start at three hundred dollars and uh they go up usually right a hundred hundred and fifty bucks per extender so you haven't been able to stay\nOut of probably really solve the problem and some of them are most of them have additional features for instance the heroes or\nHave if you pay extra ... I think it's a hundred bucks a year you're oh plus which has filtering so it keeps your kids off of\nThat site that had things like you could say to your echo pause a juniors why fight in his will go off um and you get yours will continue they have lots of nice features guest they have guessed networks they really\nDo they have like a timer they do we have whatever she will be on all night and\nI Do this with our teenager at ten pm on school like the router goes off however it only goes off for them mom and dad could stay up late\nThe password to get access to the phones because I've got so many of them and I I I just I I Am in my brain doesn't work right I'm working on probably three brain cells\n[laughter] losing them all the time because of lack of oxygen into my brain so a lot to make an excuse for it\nDo you don't have to make excuses and by the way everybody forgets the six\nSix December and that's part of my problem to the older you get the more you have problems remembering things that's bad\nEnough but I don't don't apologize Robert I'm catching up with you so here's here's the deal or\nIs it the thing that the code you enter when you first this you know the turn on the phone you have to honor code to get into it right okay so on these older Android phones they're not quite as secure an iPhone you might be a little bit more a challenge because apple really locks these things down\nBut on an Android phone or if you don't mind doing it the easiest thing is to erase it and start over do you mind doing that\nThough I don't mind that at all\nOkay so it's kind of depend on the phone but almost you know what I Will say all Android phones have a way to get into recovery mode now the easiest way is of course if your phone is unlocked you can do it right from the settings but your phone is ... so what you want to do is reset it without unlocking\nIt and you can do that but you're going to have to figure out you know inject here's the first thing I'd try it works on most Android phones you precedent hold the power button and the volume up button at the same time and that'll put you in recovery mode and that works on almost all Android phones\nIt can't promise it'll work on yours and what you might end up having to do is Google\nYour manufacture and model and the word reset or factory reset and there may be a different command for say the al ... cells or whatever but what that what what the commander in in my case of pressing the power button\nAnd you have to kind of it might be a little tricky because you have to do it in the you know just kind of at the same time and volume up and\nThen you have to like you said volume up in power at the same pile up yeah\nAnd you can you hold it and then once you ... at some point you might have to turn it off first and you could do that by even if it's locked by pressing and holding the power off button so power power at all the way down then press the power in volume button together\nAnd you'll see you should see on most of these phones they text based menu that the recovery mode\nAnd I'll tell you how you navigate that you move the volume buttons up or down through the menu and then you press the power button to select and so you're going to select reset\nAnd a reset will just to raise the phone take it\nBack as if you just bought it which actually isn't a bad thing to do once in a while\nWhile you hit it I did just buy it at all I did was get it able to connect to my wife I ... I haven't done anything else so I won't worry about losing any\nFor in a perfect perfect and then now some people are going to yell at me when I say this but I honestly think this is perfectly fine you don't have a lot of strangers coming and going in your house do you fear of zero so it's okay it's perfectly fine to write passwords down\nA ... the only issue would be if somebody could get access to the notebook you're writing it is right but as long as people aren't going\nTo get past my three fifty seven first\nOkay that sounds pretty good and\nI won't be breaking in Robert ... actually it yeah here in Florida so uh you you have you have a lot you have the stand and\nStanding cocker lawyers your great so [laughter] so what I Would do is get up and get a new book I I've actually I've actually seen these in I'm\nIn like the targets and stuff they [laughter] this is I don't know if that's a good idea but I see no books as they pass words on the front of it in gold letters that's kind of an announcement to get this no but but\nMaybe don't have one that says passerby says get a new book that you know and you keep it in your desk drawer\nAnd any time you set a code of past or whatever just write it down\nOkay that's your password fall\nThere was a second issue with them is they always want to keep updating just the apps that came with it right\nAnd they only have eight ... I'm eight ... gigabytes of hard drives space and the only one gig of memory and I'm always getting low memory an outer space\nMemory because every time they do an update their updates or at least twenty to thirty gigabytes it's or make lights I'm Sorry yeah and that adds up over time when you're getting them frequently and so\nBut you do want to let me tell you you do want those updates wherever you really do I know yeah I don't worry about the low memory a U ... most of the time those update update you know they'll downloaded first and that may be where you get that warning but as soon as yet they've done to the lead it and they'll not occupy any more than they currently do\nMost of the time updates don't add to this amount of size of these apps or the or the operating system but they are very important as long as you can run them as long as it happens it's okay\nIt does leave in downloaded folder the ... or the day that you download it and you can delete that okay\nYeah it was the lead to buy a automatically\nOh oh okay yeah I Know windows and always do that oh that's\nRight windows does not it as soon as you have a lot of room but Android understands in many cases the spaces scanned so it it will delete those don't you worry and if it doesn't you can't go in the downloads folder and and with impunity delete anything that's stuck there\nIt can handle up to thirty two gigabytes card\nWell that's another solution now the thing about cards to remember is when you install one of those cards most\nThe time apps and the operating system they don't live on the card\nBut what you can do I don't know if you're using it for music you can move music there you can move pictures there any media\nAny data files can be moved to the external card and that will free of space uh once you put it in the card for instance the camera will say oh I see of a card you want to put pictures there did you say yes and that will free of space but it doesn't you can't actually\nRobert it's great to talk to you again keep calling okay love hearing from your point the three fifty seven the other way if you\nAre show they brought you bike cargo nice\nIt'd be premier

and and if for torture you want a slightly longer lands maybe uh eighty five millimeter lines\nAre that can handle low light in that way you can get great portraits\nOr with great depths of field you know the background kind of fades away and the end of portrait pops out so each lands has different features different attributes of photographic a teacher's chest however\nAnd you know your temptation is going to be the get the ... lands but usually it's a twenty why goes why just kind of somewhat telephoto twenty four to seven a year or something like that\nUm\nIs a nice all purpose lands a lot of teachers suggest starting with a single private lives of fifty millimeter lives which approximate CI and really teaches composition because\nInstead of just zooming in and out you actually have to think about it and move closer move farther away really think about what you're getting that's going to be up to you and your daughter she's going to say no dad I don't want to have\nTo do all that I just want one lands and in and then you then you're kind of yeah you get one zoom lens the kit lands and then the question is well what do I need any other lights on or yeah it does it all\nI liked the idea of having a good low light they they tend to be more expensive than the the the how much light gathering is determined by the what we call the aperture how big the opening here and it's it's it's it's an inverse so the lower the stop the wider the aperture so\nWhen you see a lens that can do at one point a to F one point I even at one point for\nThose are lenses that have a wider can wider opening and capturing warlike which means they're great for not using slash for forgetting naturally images are great for torture they tend to be more expensive and you'll never see assume we call it a fast planes can do that you know every season that fast\nBecause it's just too expensive a fast you know maybe two point four three point five something like that okay okay so I think about instead of getting the kid getting a body and then getting and I say at one point\nFor sixteen millimeter lands I think that would be a great teaching but you got to talk to her and she's got to agree with you\nAs far as which body to get it this is an important decision because if you're getting and interchangeable lens camera you're buying into a system if you get a cannon or an icon you're going to be on camera on lenses forever after you know because they have custom ounce each of them\nSo you're making a decision in that regard right now I'm a kind of a fan of the night cause uh I was a candidate shooter for years and actually I currently shirts Sony's which are mirror lists\nUm but but for her first camera maybe an icon\nBe thirty five hundred a this is a good

P. might be using ... but in that in any event uh that's for stereo music or audio of some guy\nSo you can have one disconnect and the other one continue are there different they're separate profiles it sounds like it does it not happen if the iPhone is in a different room are far away or turned off\n... ah okay I mentioned the I thought I was just I was just wondering if that was you had some ... that that was part of the problem so but yeah I'm\n... and what was going to say that it undid petting device when I'm In it right now looking at it is you get you a hundred a ... on the nose ate it does call audio video due on contract access perfect color deal and conduct actions the John did media audio\nDrops out off the yeah you know ... yeah [noise] um oh I can say is welcome to Bluetooth I mean there may be a cause there may be a cause for this but this is not anybody uses Bluetooth to listen to music knows it's\nYou know far from perfect I always prefer a wired in fact one of the reasons I still buy Samsung phones is they still have a headphone Jack thank goodness 'cause it it doesn't ever drop out unless you plus you step on the court uh whereas I have Bluetooth drop out it's\nNot unusual for me um [noise]\nSo I don't I don't know what's\nCausing it it could be an issue with the plant products John and Florida is listening says he has the same plant products appeared to a galaxy has seven and a windows tablet and he says I have also had the occasional issue\nI don't think the pairing it's two different devices isn't necessarily the issue\nAlthough that's because that particular device can do it a lot of Bluetooth devices you can always have multiple Bluetooth devices on a phone a or a car you know usually there's some limit but you can usually have more than one\nBut it's not unusual for a Bluetooth devices to say I only will appear to one thing so uh but more modern Bluetooth devices will period a multiple us so I I just don't know um\n[noise] [noise]\nI just I feel like this is kind of par for the course\nOr for Bluetooth that plant products isn't the best sounding I Know you're only listening it sounds like to radio podcast so just voice\nBut you may be that would work better if you got a um a better Bluetooth headphones or something like that might work better that plant products releasing tend to be mostly for phone use for a headset use\n[noise] but I don't want to spend a lot of them I mean I bought the the hundred and fifty dollar um apple air pods right the blue tooth and apple even even sad you know out when they put those out all blue juice we've got is you know so we had to design a special ship the W one ship that we put in our ear pods and on our phones\nThat makes it easier to use Bluetooth and they still drop out all the time it's not at all unusual for me to be able to call\nUsing Meyer pods talking and all of a sudden nobody can hear me I Can't hear anybody I look on the phone to the phones taken aback\nFor no reason I think it's just a Bluetooth is not a very good technology and that's why I really gripes me\nThese companies particularly apple and Google and decided that the headphone Jack is superfluous we've got wireless where do you need a headphone Jack apple even added insult to injury with a new phones the tennis and the task max by by not even including an adapter that used to at least\nInclude a lightning port to headphone Jack adapt or they don't even do that anymore they include all a pair of lightening based headphones but the presumption really is you're going to use blue ...\nAnd I just don't think Bluetooth ready there are\nNewer versions of Bluetooth Bluetooth five I think is the latest [noise] maybe a you know maybe I'm pretty sure that note eight supports\nIt look and see what the suspects are I'm sitting in front of a note nine but you know again one of the reasons I buy these things have headphone jacks [laughter] if I'm On a important call\nOr I Want to listen to music I'm going to use the headphone Jack I'm On the airplane partly that's also 'cause then I can charge at the same time as I listen that's a big problem on iPhones either war\nUm scooter ex says he uses his plan product fifty two twenty four hours at a time with this picture to X.

your work\nOr you can download it it's that you mentioned try booting I presume the windows in two different versions of clinics\nAnd that's the beauty of Linux is there are many many versions hundreds and hundreds of them you can go to a\nDestroyer watch dot org and see all of them are the other one and I don't I've never tried this but it was recommended to me uh by caller last week is called he live and you get that he lives CD dot org and that is also and I think Mac users might appreciate it\nFocused on us that acts right [noise]\nAnd I think that is one thing that Mac users maybe you're a little bit different uh they've they've they've based it on Debbie in a ... that'd be an is my favorite\nKind of Linux because it's community supported it is not\nOwned by a company who wouldn't too which is owned by a company is based on Debbie in men is based on a boon to so it's based on Debbie and to removes a I think the same thing for a elementary owe us but he lives started with Debbie in and\nThey use the enlightenment desktop which is an interesting choice but they made it quite beautiful or it just looking at I I I've yet to install it I'm going to have to do it uh but that would be one certainly to try and that's the other things grade about Lennox and I know you agree lazy 'cause easy to try him\nYeah and if it's got to live version then you could just food into it\nDoes yeah all the Knicks is now that come with life versions so I Would in fact they even on the ... website they show it running on an IMAX so [laughter]\nI take an old max it's hard to get Linux working well on back in my opinion yeah you're better off doing what you do which is by refurbished Lenovo has her doubts I other great\nMachines I mean they they're they got like five five seven processors they're like the machines you've got a brand new but there to to you know three four years old\nIn a way with Linux you want it that way because as machines get older they're more likely to be supportive you know it takes a little times of brand new machine often is as well supported by what next\nBut I Would I generally do it 'cause I buy you know one or two just for review purposes or one or two new windows laptops a year sometimes more when they get to be a year or two old just like you instead of buying refer by just take mine I put limits on them I just put limits on my\n... a second generation of yoga and it runs due to flee the excellent yoga it's just a gorgeous machine made even more gorgeous\nMy favorite Linux the one I use personally is based on arch Linux another very good community supported distribution\nHe's a little different than Debbie and Debbie in is more stable Archie is what we call the rolling update so it is constantly updated in ... that's probably not best for beginners or but it is but I like to have the latest versions of everything on my own systems that most\nPeople I talked to all they want is a [noise]\nA rock solid secure platform they crash or they want some process\nAnd they there's a free officers Lieber office which is really good and does look a lot like Microsoft Office um they're browsers at the same you can use you know Firefox or a\nChromium which is the open source version of crime and it's exactly the same as Firefox or chrome on a windows or Mac so they're ... they they generally the email is not what do you use for email on a for these people is there a particular program you like\nA well I used to have a a sunny\nBut it's pretty good I like claws but I don't know uh if clause is a good choice for

bands with one ... one of the reasons I like five gee you know most modern wife I routers will do the older two point four gear hurts banned and\nIt will do the newer five ...\nOne of the reasons I like the five gee routers is it doesn't propagate as far as the higher the frequency them more easily stopped by our windows doors trees\nAnd so what I like one theory of this is that you instead of trying to blast your way to why five success\nYou make little pools of why fi that are only visible to you and anybody in in close proximity and you have lots of little ones is is that flu philosophy plays one of those ... I use that I've mentioned\nAnd by having many little clues one in each room one in the hall you can create little pools of why they don't get interfered with eh\nBecause the five get your herd signals from your neighbors a hundred feet away aren't really propagating through your windows and doors and and nor are you interfering with them and I think it's a much more neighborly way to get very good why five five years also can be very fast\nSo that's my my standard now for a for why fight if I if at all possible or I'll make sure I get five gee routers and I'll use a lot actually five gee that's probably confusing five ... hertz routers 'cause we're not talking five gee cell phone that something else\nHey it's great to talk to you or a fellow Linux nerds\nThankfully call number eighty eight eighty eight\nX.

and a half old and we're very happy with him she use are I'm sure there's a song constantly when she's at a particular time limits or whatever I let my phone go down to you know\nThe low for charges and I'm going to be a user for like two or three days [noise] anyway um I Know apple is offering a\nTwenty nine dollar lottery replace them till the end of the year for these photos um capacity is eighty six percent minus eight nine percent is it worth the money to replace goes\nYeah I mean you're you're pretty good shape so when the phone comes it's delivered to your door it's a hundred percent capacity that means\nIn generally are all lithium ion batteries of a certain number of charge discharge cycles they go through generally around five hundred so uh you know in a fraction like what your wife's doing a fractional charge discharge so she's letting it go down a quarter inch charging it up a quarter\nFor those make one are you are more you know discharging fully recharging so you're going to get that five hundred times\nAs it gets closer to that five hundred point it's going to get lower and lower the capacity at some point it's going to get so low that really won't hold a church anymore and you will need a new battery apple had to do this they didn't want to do this they had to do it because they\nThey started pushing out software updates that we're slowing phones down with ... with their batteries were warning because they didn't want the phone to crash if there would be high demand on that battery sometimes that guy's happened they say\nA lot of people said no it doesn't happen Android doesn't do it or it's a just a ploy to get you to buy a new phone and in response apple said well All right we'll let you get a new batteries you want I think he recommend I think you're probably right I don't you know it's that's a pretty high level\nSo I lost ...\nA good deal [laughter] if I you know he looks is thirty bucks\nI don't think you need it if the world's

into this it's like it's nice to see a young person who likes the old stuff thank you Michael\nThanks also that Kim Schaffer who puts up with me every weekend answers your goals thanks to you too I'm Glad you're here we appreciate it\nA every every weekend I'm going to help you with your technology that's my job Dave in Sarasota, Florida is next yellow days\nGood afternoon or good afternoon to your crusade to call her she had it my you know try and trying to save some money okay in Britain some\nCars 'cause we travel and we love the car clay option that we get when we put us on\nThem that awesome\nIt is I Love it and uh the challenge we've got is that we have to relatively recent cars the dude a costly option so I've been playing around trying to figure out how to um use my iPhone\nTo build a link to a wife I I'd I'd all I'm traveling\nOh what a clever idea you want to basically I'll take the eye pad as your does your car play are yeah\nYeah that way my wife and I can see where the maps gone and we can do agree\nSo much more pleasant experience and um but the problem I got is that the maps on the eye pad even though I'm I'm connected by Bluetooth or something do not keep up with the travel um it's a life I I\nYou know why that is that since I had I had yeah that I pet doesn't have GPS\nDoes it have to have GPS started to work like that\nSo you're so you're dreaming the map from the phone to the I had no\nIdea hooking up the I had a hot spot to my\nOffice so using the ... yes so that's exactly why so um this is this is unfortunately and it's not an issue in the phone every iPhone has GPS built in\n... eye patch do not unless you get one where they sell your ship in it to sell your ship as a single chip that has both radios for GPS and LT\nAnd so that's the problem precisely is it the ... the er I pat I'm fact I'm kind of impressed the packing kind of figure out where you are doing that by triangulating why buy access points and if you get out in the country where there's no why won't know where you are\nWell it's a little slow sometimes you miss the terms\nBefore you really yeah we're really in your phone is reliable 'cause it's using GPS Wright Patt is not okay it does blow it does the location is actually clever\nA trick that ah ah apple uses Google used it was a company called sky hook that pioneered this they drove ... a lot of cars around with GPS is is that I noticed\nWhen I'm Fifteen feet from ... pointe a twelve feet from ... to point B and a hundred feet from Agnew quite see I'm here\nIn the may literally made a map\nTriangulating all the Y in almost everywhere in the country and then selling that to Google and apple apple and Google Now do that themselves with their own cars but uh that's a very clever technology but it's not perfect obviously\nInteresting so if I bought an eye pad than had the GPS and the wife I ... ... ...\nYour trick is your next I pat and good news apples probably coming out with I had this month for a get one within ... chip then you don't have to be I mean you're still gonna have to pay for an out to eat connection that's a pain but uh but you'll have that way you won't have to pay for it to the phone for the data and you'll have GPS will be accurate\nOkay sounds like a solution I thought maybe I was missing something no you're you're it was\nYeah too bad it's just the way it is not a problem\nAnd the reason is that Israel is right ... thanks for the call is very simple and the the the chip that apple puts in\nProbably was from Qualcomm nowadays I guess it's written tell a is a dual purpose chip at the GPS and Internet uh and so they just don't they just don't put that and now they're going to they're going to release I'm almost certain\nI sort of evidence that they're going to release new I've had this year probably knew AIPAC pros or remember that Apple's latest phones all the phones this year have a new interface they don't have a home button they don't have a fingerprint reader they face i._d.\nAnd they have new ways of swiping and swooping in looping to control the thing because you don't have a whole buttons you swipe up to go home and all that\nAh apple is going to inevitably move everything to them so the first I think the first step there will be these new I pass it they'll release now we have an event no one knows\nThere's no consensus on this or they are also expected to release new Mac platforms probably not the new ... crow but\nWell I don't you know we're looking for frankly a\nMac book air in a ... book replacement of some kind and uh that would also probably come out new era pot that\nThat there's some evidence that they're they're going to upgrade the Airbus yeah a partly because they've been deeply discounted by a lotta merchants about apple but others that usually means rather clearing them out for the new ones\nSo it's enough new stuff they could have an effect but I in my gut is they're not you know just they'll just appeared there'll be a press release most people think it'll be later this month closer to Halloween\nBut if you're in the market for a night that it would be prudent at this point we're air pots or a ... ... it would be prudent to wait till the end the month see what apple has to say\nAs usual we have to wait and they don't tell us um let's see here that was David Sarasota wasn't it yeah now I blew it Sam in West covina hello Sam [noise]\nToilet\nWill come on over I'm well how are you\nOh good good thinking it was Michael questions ... ... I just picked up and I met congratulations on the law but thank you thank you so incredible machine or yeah PC all my life so I don't know what the heck I'm going with it [laughter]\nIt won't take long they're not they're not so very different they all have the same heritage you know\nMy my kids are the ones teaching me right now oh that must be ...
