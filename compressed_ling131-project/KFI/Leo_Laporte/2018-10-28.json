I Would get real quick here on in April I had the for the call it a German engineered German made boring it's ... and at the ... to comply and I thought I was doing all the right thing that's fourteen now on the air\nAnyway the dollar and a contractor um put it in and that truly later targeted buckled there was a huge change and whether we went from might agree kind of take the degree and then\nSpent that time they had been out three times to cut away remote promoting and then cut away the um the planks right and I had an independent a guy come out and he said there's no moisture on her to get moisture Cabot and I'm sure he basically um blame the installers\nSaudi authorities and cutting away I wind up what my next fab like we can cutting away what do we\nDo when when you really like an old boat or walk across the FARC crack right\nYeah that is usually the size of the sign that are limited floors under too much attention and uh so ... are they using all of the appropriate threshold devices that every room or are they trying to consistently run laminate from one room or into another without any of the threshold hurry\nSo the first time are they did not a uh there were no brakes and\nNow they've installed the breaks\nOut which I didn't want that that was okay if we have to go we have to do it so I think it already unglued any cases like port closets and that so all hell we felt blue tape everywhere where yeah or the child for me the closet that sort of\nThing ah gosh All right Mary I I don't know exactly what to tell you all all I can say is this when laminate floors installed per specifications it needs to have at least a quarter inch sometimes as much as three eighths of an inch depending on the manufacturers specifications\nFree gap all round all sides of the floor because a lemon it's will expand and contract and then that needs to be an empty gap\nSo that it gives freedom for the floor to expand and not buckle and also there needs to be freedom for each room to slide independently of the next so that you're not running a it's a mistake to run limited a consistent all the way through from one room to another\nAs annoying as those transition pieces are that's the way it's supposed to be so if you are still experiencing tension and buckling that I'm going to say there are still areas where the laminate is pushing up against a wall or somehow under tension so that when it expands\nIts buckling up and uh I think you need to address the installation yet one more time I'm so sorry about that but uh there's not a whole lot of other specifics I can give you a here without having seen it myself but laminate should not behave that way\n[noise] and if there's proven that there's no moisture in the floor then it's an installation problem it just is okay\nOr Thanks Mary appreciate your call see if we can squeeze one more in here John welcome home\nOn being good man I\nA problem here uh my walls are currently\nAt this moment

and maybe you can help why do we actually yeah I\nWill I Will put in the show notes a link to the an article from the national institutes of health uh of course the United states or you know and I ... a very reliable a trusted source and there's a paper here from a fairly recently um on\nVirtual reality and pain management current trends in future directions that does describe because we don't really understand the mechanism why this would work but it's very much being studied and with some success and the question is what it is what's off or are they using how are they doing it and how does it work\nAnd this ah this this article I think you'll find a little more informative a than a newspaper article about this um\nCalled blast that they use evidently yeah it does is it occupies the line is such a way it and at the same time transfer signals to the ... yeah\nSo they they they mentioned in this in this scholarly paper that the number of an age funded studies investigating the use of E R for pain management has doubled\nOr this you know they're ... they're you know one of the techniques is biofeedback you know deep breathing with stuff that we know is already worked but using VR a or B R plus hypnosis VR plus breathing exercises\nSeem to have some some results I've also seen V. are used in treatment of Pete TST post traumatic stress disorder and that seems to also be a effective\nI you know I always would caution VR is the hottest thing in technology today and so it always caution a little bit um you know when it's the the\nThe flavor of the month that you know there's but I does it is very interesting I I see the the uh the\nArticle that you're referring to [noise] um and it's certainly a lot better than opioids and opioid addiction but\nYou're right the getting getting getting that are getting that software is an interesting challenge and my guess is that none of these techniques work without a doctor president you know it's not something you could take home\nAnd and do 'em or there's also an article on plus a scholarly articles um the impact of virtual reality and chronic pain that could put that in the show to us as well so there's\nThere's a lot of studies on this and they sleep they seem to agree that it does help but you know almost anything helps [laughter] I think if I if\nIt's not just the flavor the ... because they mention hunter Hofmann Lewis evidently a VR pioneer\nYeah I'll watch the study back in early to say oh yeah it's been going on for a while that's right\nSo it's it's been around and now it seems to be getting fined

X. see that will restore your boot record it's enough of a complicated process and I want you to follow the steps in order and accurately\nThat I'm going to put a link in the show notes to or you could just Google it to a a a step by step and you want to do it accurately\nUm so you can also used his part to do it but that's a\nThat's a little bit more tricky I'm not sure I'd recommend that I think you want to really use the built in windows recovery\nFeatures so um [noise] yeah well yeah you can you give if you search for fix the MBR or fix you we have five boot you'll find the number of articles or don't do the ...
