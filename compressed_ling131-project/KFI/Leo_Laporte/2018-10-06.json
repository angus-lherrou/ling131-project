parents a bill my grandmother's house ... she was about to lose it and are they put up any five thousand dollar ticket out she passed away there's another family member that are on the on the east to the house doesn't want to cooperate so what are they what a legal recourse\nHere's the problem you have a map right I Apologize here is the problem you have\nSomeone else owns a house and what they did is probably legally gained your grandmother eighty five thousand\nDollars and it's a gift in the meantime someone else owns the house masked\nOne of my name is on the property\nThat's different than someone else and the parents owned the property or the estate [noise]\nSo uh you've got a boy you're far away from the phone where are you speaking ten feet away from the receiver\nI'm Sorry about that okay the um [noise]\nWhoever owns the property owns the property so now who are okay you've got a the brother or the relative to what was the part of the house and you have\nYour family member of the only part of a house correct [noise] both their names on the deed is a joint tendency\n[noise] okay if they're both around then one of the parties can sell for the sale of the house but that's it [noise] okay see grandma any connection to grandma does nothing because you know in the house now it can be argue well\nIt's kind of a tough one you can make an equitable argument that we gave her eighty five I Know I don't\nThink even that is going to work I think it's going to be considered a gift a grandma so a double bottom line what do you do you do what I did with my grandmother when she was around when she needed money tell her to go pounds\nThan\nWhy should I help you out because you're like ran son I chair what that's gonna make me want to give you money grandma she wouldn't talk to me after that but you know what that is okay to hello Brian Europe\n[noise] oh hey yeah about twelve years ago my\nFather in law died and he left his house to my wife and her brother and so my wife was drinking a cup of rooms over the years and now my brother in law is so whacked out on drugs that she can't get anyone in the house and so my situation we know that we have to sell the house or something like this can go on like this [laughter]\nHow do we set my brother in law brother in law up on like say a monthly allowing because he's not capable of\nOf ... when the phone yeah it is so here it's real simple you force the sale of the house right if he's not signing off you simply forced the sale would you can do with a a partition action\nLawsuit for partition and the court will give it to you and then he's getting half the money there is no way there's no way around it unless you go in I that is your wife goes in and gets a conservator shipped over\nHim but I got to tell you he's ... people are allowed to be drug addicts Errol like they're allowed to take all their money and spend it on drugs\nYeah ... it's what we see down the road is that is not going to end up\nGetting it doesn't matter doesn't matter as an adult he has a right to destroy his wife right I understand where your heart's coming from you're trying to save his ass I get that and it's someone that guy's care foreigner brother nuts wonderful thing but\nBottom line is he can destroy his life he has that choice and are now unless he is willing to allow your ah his sister or your wife a conservative ship would you be willing to do that\nYeah that that the end I don't know\nThat's actually how people found out about this the super micro mother board that was used on the elemental was discovered by Amazon security they reported the discovery U.S authorities and I'm quoting Bloomberg Businessweek quote sending a shutter through the intelligence community\nThe servers from elemental can be found everywhere the Mormon church the department of defense data centers the CIA drone operations navy warships and super micro put mother boards and many others servers\nAll over the world [noise]\nThis was was terrifying us in ... this is again according to Bloomberg Businessweek us investigators found that ships have been inserted during the manufacturing process to officials say by operatives from a unit of the People's Liberation army\nIn super micro China's spies appeared to offend a perfect conduit for what U.S officials now described as the most significant supply chain attack known to have been carried out against U.S companies except they're\nAll denying it now they're all denying it\nNow they're saying what is Bloomberg Businessweek talking about Bloomberg Businessweek quoted numerous sources in the intelligence community and at Amazon and apple but they didn't quote him by name\nVery common practice\nSomebody in the intelligence community isn't going to say hey it's me they're going to go to Bloomberg Businessweek and say look this is\nA deep\nThere there's a variety of phrases though use deep background off the record sometimes they'll just say and I think this is the case here you can use this please do we want the world it out but don't don't quote me one official from the again U.S intelligence community according to Bloomberg\nBusinessweek you notice I keep saying that says investigators found it eventually affected almost thirty companies\nIncluding a major bank government contractors in the world's most valuable company apple apple had planned to order and get this more than thirty thousand thirty thousand super micro servers\nIn two years for a global network of data centers three senior insiders at apple according to Bloomberg Businessweek said in the summer of twenty Fifteen it to found malicious chips on super micro mother boards apple severed ties with super micro the following year\nAnd that we know is true that fact for what apple says was unrelated reasons okay so that's\nThat's the story explosive story that came out on Thursday the next day apple Amazon super micro and the Chinese government strenuously denied the allegations apple released a statement later in the day as the super micro\n\nIt is it is a bizarre and for those of us on the outside in comprehensible\nConflict\nBloomberg Businessweek is a very reliable source and frankly I credit there's they're reporting there's you're not going to get reporting for a variety of different companies and the U.S intelligence community the that's the ... the same\nLie so what's ... what's going on [noise]\nAnd uh I'm I'm I'm reading an article by Zach would occur for a tech crunch who covers cyber security and national security has done it for five years including at CBS\nHe says even with this story my gut is mixed ... where reporters cross any topic and beat try to seek the truth tapping information from the intelligence community is near impossible for spies and diplomats it's illegal to share classified information with anyone and can be punishable by time in prison as a security\nReporter you're either incredibly well sourced are downright lucky more often than not it's the latter you're just lucky\n[noise]\nNaturally would occur rights people are skeptical of this by chip story on one side you have Bloomberg's decades long stellar reputation of reporting ac human\nThoroughly research story citing more than a dozen sources some inside government some out and publishing enough evidence to present a convincing case on the other side of the sources are anonymous\nProbably 'cause this was classified so accountability is difficult and then you have the denials from the companies themselves\n\nBut would occur points out these are not bullet proof an outright rejection of the stories claims they're subject to legal counsel and government regulation\nSo what to believe I I Wish I could tell you I don't know and I don't think anybody knows\nI have\nThere's just it seems highly unlikely to me that Bloomberg would have independent sources that have ride of places are reporting the same story if it weren't true if it weren't true\n[laughter] so I get I guess that's what I'm going with [laughter]\nBut\nAh\nAll is not clear here all is not clear\nWhat do you think maybe maybe hey are you an insider at a a three letter agency over there and clean Virginia tell me what should we believe you know I think uh I think\nMaybe the details aren't as important as the fact that we know this kind of stuff is probably happening most of what we use is made in China the problem is it's kind of hard to put hardware a chip on a mother board and not be detected\nThat seems a little difficult to believe I don't know\nEighty eight eighty eight asked me I'll give us a ring\nOf us though which which what you think our show that they brought you by

E. we local life when they can't find twenty four hour newsroom I'm Julie fighter go\nThere's one laser and there is a blue blazer and it hits a phosphorus remember C. R. T. TVs yeah use phosphorus yeah well this is the same sort of deal there the blue laser hits a fast for which generates yellow light and yellow light can actually\nBe split into green and red\nOr yellow was blue and green no it's blue and green and red or blue and green when it's reflective when it's transmission correct It's blue it's yellow in red or green and red [laughter] colors hello I'm like\nHey I Know I Know but basically if you have a yellow something that is missing yellow light yeah that can be split into red and green okay so they've got the blue from the laser ... and then the yellow foster which is then emitting yellow yellow which is then split into reading reading rain\nSo they've got red green and blue which are the three calls you need to do the entire correct color spectrum correct and deal he normally use is why the LAPD he's for the light what are they your\nLimo or fluorescent all in a in a project or they use a a either I'd ultra high pressure lamp those are the things that burned out yes correct and and in short order too and you have to replace them at at a cost of a hundred or two or three hundred on one advantage of lasers is they last a long time very long to they're typically rated like twenty thousand hours\nWhich at eight hours a day is I forget exactly but here you know year many many years yeah\nSo this new one actually I was pretty impressed with a single laser but the colors were slightly washed out ... this new one has two lasers\nCorrect that has a blue blazer and a red light so it's red is more accurate well it's it's I wouldn't exactly call it more accurate we did a lot of measuring writer it is certainly brighter no question about that and it's very deep bread it is a very saturated read\nYeah I was looking at a stretch and that can yesterday\nAnd I was at a but I have to say that you have your calibrated it mhm so we I think we had it on the couch does your calibrated on ... on a Thursday night yes Thursdays I came in friday morning ... had to see this hundred inches yeah folks if you've never had a hundred inch screen or house you'll get a sense of the good news is this screen\nIt has a fold up there's ways to\nGet it in the house right yeah I'm sure must role you don't have to yeah because you don't win folded okay that we want to increases no no no but you can roll it up you don't have to take the roof of the house that's right [laughter]\nWhich which means it's bigger than your door in some cases in some ... in\nCertain directions yeah\nI mean the point of this whole TV this late they call it a laser t._v. they want it to be a TV replacement right so they say okay I think about buying a hundred inch LCD TV or old led TV or something\nHundreds of thousands or hundreds a hundred thousand dollars or more easily 'cause I've seen them I mean sure Adam and yeah yeah plus they way hundreds of pounds they had to move it the seven forty the belly yeah there is that original yes on a hundred and something inch plasma yeah exactly I showed it on Regis and Kelly yeah ...\nYeah [laughter]\nWell in this case um it's so much easier the screen is obviously just ways a few pounds and no big deal you can hang\nIt on a wall easily we had I did hear this studio yeah\nIt's kind of like a projector ... a little more solid and it's kind of like a ... but then you put this ultra short throw projector eight inches from the wall and then you don't have to worry about walking in the beam of the project or lie you don't even need to be in a dark room it's really intended to be a living room TV\nPlus a off angle viewing yeah remarkable you might actually have at the side of the screen is still looks full color or so there's two laser I was really impressed with I thought it was it was much\nBetter it looks really good it does it uh so basically you you still you have this red laser that produces a red light and the blue laser still hits a yellow phosphorus from which green is extracted so you still get red green and blue\nUh you don't really have to do that much anymore but I what do you change what are the settings well the settings are they're there to basically there's one for what's called white balance or gray scale which is\nWhere what color of white you might think white wait a minute white as white there's no color in white his wife well there is I mean you might have a white that slice your gender\nYour light masked your wife she'll tell you [laughter] oh no no that's to yellow for white and blue of oil exactly a Democrat\nOf away so what you want is there's a there's a very clearly defined standard for what the color of white that was used when the content was created a so the movie producers of the movie a color wrists and the director all get together around a reference monitor\nThat has been calibrated to be a particular color of white and to have particular colors are red green and blue\nIt's not always white white it could be a more ... warmer white I Know it could um although again there's a there's a standard yeah but they don't always use it I remember in the godfather the or cinematographer took the film the exposed film\nAnd dragged through T he wanted to make it [laughter]\nI'm tired I ever heard of that at the time I was a very nerve wracking thing because I wasn't I had to do it to the exposed the shot filmed them don't mailman\nSo if I somehow screwed it up there goes the movie but there is it now and\nIn recent uh uh you know read digital positions of it they they've corrected it a little dark and gloomy right is right but uh that we want remember that first scene in the godfather where he's sitting in his office mansion and it's his daughter's wedding day and yeah saving you know ... ... ...\nThe models wanting a very dark and gloomy scene in the original it's almost ... you would like it\n[laughter] a dark as long as I was watching it on an old lady with a ... or you can\nBarely see anything I'd like to see it now in an HD are ... there have been re mastered it early on is is there a little bit less dark and I don't know if I I Know that for instance for a couple of the director wasn't involved in the rematch drink so I don't know that that's a tricky\nThing isn't it when the original director or the visionary who came up with the movie isn't involved in the re mastering right how do you know you're still remaining true to the creators content\nSo that just graders anyone that chose is ... what white you know ... so it's not a ... he doesn't say will use pan tone zero\nNo it's a it's a standard that technically is called the sixty five ... uh which is a a point on a graph that is in the white area of all the different colors that we can\nThat we can see you've ever seen and you can Google is a\nColor gamut sharks ... otherwise known as C I e ... diagram\n[laughter] and it looks a it looks like a triangle most of the time and I definitely like a triangle each point being red green and blue ... the the points of the triangle being red green and blue and so that's what they're messing with ...\nAnd and then there's the white point in the center of the dry where that white pointed and exactly where that why point isn't exactly where those red green and blue points are determines how the you know what the picture will look\nLike you know when you're when you're calibrating though do you know well I guess you have some source material that you know that it's calibrated to\nWell you again there are standards and the software that we use which is called ... from Spector Cal a has that been programmed in so basically you see on the screen a little chart\nAnd the shows you where the white point is and then if you move the controls in the TV around\nYou see that point actually move around is that the first thing he fixes give that point yes the white point is\nThe first thing you'd get correct and you have to get a correct not only at one luminous level but at all of them and it's less from dark the bright right because the white point at twenty percent or twenty percent of a ... white has to be the same color of white as eighty percent wow\nUh so you do the ... the gray scale what's called the gray scale you do that first and then you do the colors and once you get those all set up then you start looking at real content and see how it looks wow so that's why it takes them time\nYeah and you don't trust your eyes\nNo because everybody's eyes\nSite is a little different right and so what I see as a particular color you'll look at it and say well it's a slightly different color to me so the\nThe the software and hardware what he does is harbor like attached to the screen\nNo it it it's a meter it's sort of like an average dreamed at the screen and the old days you'd see with computer screens people would calibrate them I used to call him screen stars they would just yeah right on the screen right the the spiders invited apple\nYeah there and there are those with a direct view screen that you just they slap right onto the screen and they are and then you can have the lights on with a with a meter that you're farther away\nOr I was going to turn off all the lights which is why we did it at night yeah because really dark yeah that studio afterward there's no there's no windows well that's true except there's there is a port hole in the low you're right a little noise all weekend\nNight pitch black ... you're aiming this thing at the screen and then the software is running the thing is conducted to a ... a laptop by Louis B the software is running ... and then you're missing with you mess with the little dials on the TV to get into\nDials in the old for ...\n... yeah yeah yeah you have to use a remote to\nDo you have to use the TV's remote to do that yeah exactly I mean it just ... yeah and you watch you watch the little point moved towards its target to target as indicated\nSo all of that would say oh it's perfect but I looked at it I felt well which will be a red liquid washed out in my in my eyes are spoiled\nMm well what's your ... your eyes are spoil one vivid mode\nScott ... is our home theater gave his review of this TV and full will appear on our screen saver show later this afternoon where to record that you could actually watch it if you want as we record it we let people watch

all is it are ECU VA a which is a free program or was able to recover some fast but only in some cases\n\nA Microsoft apparently had a similar problem in April when they put out each you know throughout ... I didn't know that so I don't know what's going on\nBut I Do know that Microsoft taking this seriously enough that it's saying new we're not going to put that out I have seen some complain\nThat not only the league filed and your documents folder it deletes entire profiles which would be really even much worse 'cause your profile as your log in your account to delete that would be essentially to delete you yikes\nI'm so this is this is a fairly serious issue and and again why is why is is coming up I don't understand\nThat they they millions I mean millions of people tested this program they should have known I don't understand how they don't know [noise] they've Sioux City Iowa Hi Dave thanks for hanging on the report the tech guy\n[noise] Hi Leo how're you doing today I'm great how are you sound a little Cokie\nOh ... where would they do for you\nI'm just a I think they have a question that is probably pretty a widespread interest got a whole network and it has a tendency to drop\nA individual computers off of the network so they can't see each other um regardless of what the shared situation is on each one um [noise] it\nHas um that quite a few um\nDevices on the network but that hasn't seemed to affect this situation I'm\nIn the ... what is it the ... is it that these devices suddenly are no longer on the Internet or is it the your file shares are dropping\nNo the file shares the issue it as they can all find the Internet all the time\nWithout us all you're still connected and they're still on the network but the file shares are getting dropped a that is\nAnd you're using to you the file sharing your using Microsoft's file sharing system\n... yes ... and the old days in the tea I've got one extreme machine still on the on the thing there it would you'd have to go to the ... group\nUm [noise] uh to find the rest of the computers on their the windows ten days here are it's not a designated\nYeah they've changed or how the whole thing works um and I presume that you've now that you're in windows ten you you kind of disconnected and reconnected just to make sure\nHe has at times if I read both them or the system does down for some reason power loss or something comes back up and I'm usually you can see them but it seems like it's the machines are idle for a while you're not you're not accepting a uh the shared a function\nAnd it just goes away tend to forget\nOr they or they belong yeah no this is all a DAC Pete to or does she have a designated rather than yeah yeah\nYou're not using static IP address is for each corrective Irish yeah I'm here and by the way that might be one way to do it I Wonder if the\nThe this shouldn't happen but it could be that you're getting new leases what so this is on why\nOh no I'm In fact ...

concerned about\n\nAnd again that's the only time is going to tell if any of those things come to pass and one of the things that was really interesting yesterday when a Susan Collins of Maine\nWas giving her case for why she was going to vote in favor issue went through some of the rulings that are Brett Kavanaugh had been part of it and said that a lot of the scare tactics that are being used are not necessarily going to come to pass\nShe pointed out examples of when he has voted against what the conservative mainstream a opinion may have been or when he went\nToward what the constitution said she said he follows the constitution he's not using his opinions he's following what the law says so to be really interesting to see how that plays out again Brett Kavanaugh will be the newest associate justice of the U.S Supreme Court he was narrowly confirmed\nBy the Senate and just moments ago fifty to forty eight\nHis confirmation of course follows a tumultuous confirmation process\nWas highlighted by sexual assault allegations against the federal judge he loudly and vehemently rejected those accusations\nProtesters did try to interrupt the Senate vote in the gallery they were ...

extreme partisan who doesn't have the temperament or the integrity to be on the Supreme Court he called the confirmation process one of the saddest chapters in Senate history and a low point for the country\nTrump of course have to Kavanaugh to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and President Trump did tweet this morning it was a great day for America he said that Kavanaugh
