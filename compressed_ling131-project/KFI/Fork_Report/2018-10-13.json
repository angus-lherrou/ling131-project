some from one of his only real life and you can't like twenty four hour news from the L U was the end it's teachers' union have failed to come to a labor agreement in its third day of mediation the district\nIs filed an unfair labor practice charge against the United teachers Los Angeles yesterday refusal to participate in the ... in good faith the el ... claims UT LA has admitted the only reason it participated in mediation at all which was a way to a strike fast\nThe last time the district had a teacher strike was in Nineteen eighty nine the rainy weather is heading out of Southern California National Weather service meteorologist Tom Fisher says an upper level low was moving out over the coast the rain\nAssociated with this is predominantly out and desert and the Colorado River basin however we do have a few wraparound showers moving into the LA mountains\nBecause things will clear up later today thunderstorm still possible for the mountains and a fire whether watch has been issued from tomorrow night through Tuesday in LA and Ventura counties because of Santa Ana winds Fisher says most of LA got less than a half inch of rain overnight\nAnd then what that tells you your brain is now we're at a battle we're in a battle with the things that are outside of our home\nRight because now you're home is where you live and everything outside your home is what you're trying to keep out and that means bugs in rodents in all these things and we go in this battle a so psychologically we get to this place where we have seen bugs as that which is outside\nAnd other types of food is that which is inside our home in something in that psychology is changed us to where the it factor\nIt has that has become so great that that's the next psychological jump right my wife who doesn't eat my wife and my who doesn't eat red meat\nUm or much you know chicken or fish or anything either when I watch a movie you know a cooking series or something where they manufacture fabricating an animal they're breaking down the animal that is a crime scene to her\nShe didn't she didn't look that that's crazy if she sees me eat like a drumstick\nOff of a chicken that's nuts to her she she doesn't see it as chicken she sees it as a leg she sees it as what it is\nI have\nBecause I've eaten it since I was a kid she is not that I see it as food\nSimply as food and it's that psychological difference that we're going to need to jump over that hurdle that we are going to need to get over because of the X factor of bugs\n[laughter] as a producer Brooke just holds up so we've got these right here now who else has these bra everybody all of that so you need a Kurdish and Larry\nYeah I got them as well yeah you're pretty stoked that yeah you switched with Amy today [laughter] you know I looked at when I first looked at these I 'cause I had I have a cup filled with cinnamon toast crunch a surreal in here as well and I thought oh this this doesn't look quite like cinnamon toast crunch [laughter]\nNo so um is disgusting looking as Alan expecting\nAnd yeah there there's like chips they're actually delicious I I I like I like these bugs [laughter]\nWhat I'm trying one now well there's there's two flavors here we have the sour cream an onion and we have crispy\nTaco do we know what kind of bugs he's actually are icy arcades crickets are they are yeah crickets are pretty uh but not bad I don't know they're pretty good I got Eric it's many times before but so this is kind of a treat to get on I'm just trying to light colored\nWon the ... the smell is more the overwhelming part because they put in a lot of that like flavoring for yeah but yeah but once you get over that it's not it's not bad\nTo me it was so much slavery because the actual cricket to taste disgusting\nNo I'll tell you something 'cause I I've had just basically you go to walk and restaurant there they may have a little garlic on them or something but they're\nThey're they're not really covered with a lot so in this case they taste protein ... that's what I Know it sounds weird but you know when you have a protein shake or something you can taste the protein approach or protein yard as well\n[laughter] that is what bugs tastes like to me so to me it's not the flavor of the flavors not really\nThat great one way or the other it's um uh like when you have grasshoppers the lower portion of their legs are shin ... is like a\nYou know like a high east ring it's just a little rough [laughter]\nFor a little weird a little weird [laughter]\nThe bug itself doesn't bother [laughter] it's like an editor what or even\nThese tasty right I mean you can sit there and I get all those and to have a beer you wouldn't think twice about it all out All right we'll come back we're going to

always welcome I mean well fed host Neil ... thanks for hanging out or we're chatting there's a brand new series six part series on the Smithsonian Channel\nAnd uh it's now streaming on Smithsonian earth and Smithsonian Channel dot com slash bug bites in his poll bug bites and uh someone who is in two of those episodes is chef David George Gordon is on the phone with us welcome back chef so ah\nYou write a cookbook many years ago now eating a that eat a bug cookbook a among other titles as well and and now you're seeing\nThere is a way but I mean there's there's flowers or your protein flowers there we the the bugs that we had on the air or or packaged in commercialized bugs um are you seeing a slight change at all in that time since you originally ...\nWhen I have to say there are enough change and actually\nI credited a lot of it to five years ago when the food and agriculture organization that's a branch of a un they published a report about the fact that the planet was growing population of growing so rapidly\nThat we couldn't constantly feed everybody hamburgers we need to look for alternative sources of protein and this report a hundred and eighty eight eight out here in eighty eight eight of of it gets really putting a hard case for why the racing and eating insects\nSo that in turn inspired a lot of people start\nFresh out of the college started up and crowd source funded campaigns to create cricket farm and make all the products as you say with a book called cricket our or powder cricket powder and um it's amazing how much interest it's been generated just over the last five or six tier\nNow yeah it did when I started the show which is probably six years ago now something like that one of the first things I talked about was the importance of of insects as a food source and then it was going to come and that I felt like that step that first baby step was going to be the flowers because\nThat's all right it just is you you don't see it you know you don't have the X factor you just have it is kind of a sheer protein but now we're going\nTo tell you though I'm Sorry to interrupt but no please don't\nEven with that approach I encounter people will go I Know it's good for me I just can't bring myself to eat it and you know we're talking about an energy bar basically are type a thing chocolate or fruit more than you're certainly tasting cricket\nBut people have very strong dislike of insects in our culture than it everybody's ... troops in western culture are insects or the bad guys so the idea of actually eating them like leaping with the enemy\nSo where did that come from\n[laughter] you know I personally maintain it came from a agriculture at Fenway gotten into firing as opposed to hunting and gathering or\nAbove the enemy the fun fact I think that that insects are the only animals on the planet veteran direct competition with people for food and if you're raising wheat for example in the form of locusts swing by\nBy wheat and hello loco so between that and the fact that a lot of insects actually Paris ties things like cattle or seat you know again there are the enemy or the idea of a limb and aiding them and it's pretty much the order of events in our culture\nOkay well you'd still be eliminating them you'd just be eliminating them after you eat them\n[laughter] that's right I think it it to be that the one thing if you're outside of the same major incident spraying everything I have a site type thing ourselves\nIf you can't beat them eat um I like that exactly so yeah it it's a weird why'd you know I I Know the the\nAmerican the American in me is like well ... percent is eating bugs let them and will eat the meat but it yeah right more than that they're ... it's a it's an ecosystem that needs balancing and we're rapidly running out of a space and resort yes that's right\nIt's it's shocking you know the the not so fun fact is\nTo get a pound the steak it requires two thousand gallons of water\nYeah we talked a little you know raising the\nCrowd and all that and also the ... the amount of food and if you put ... Fifteen pounds of grain enjoy how you're going to get one pound to beat back I mean could that same amount in\nA grasshopper you get ten pounds of protein back so\nYeah it makes the math adds up period I mean it makes sense what what are we going to need to get over that uh\n[noise] I Know that there's there's a story and that was in the news about a um ... in Australia there is a classroom where they're actually teaching this they're actually cooking with bugs and eating bugs they're trying to show this in the classroom these high school students\nTo Seattle dot com we've seen T.

attempt to overhaul that would\nBe hard to put down [laughter] I mean it literally is right now that that that would be a problem that's something you could drink all day ... it's it's designed to do that yeah it just it really is incredibly fighting or and what is this a okay so the second one eye liner amber I'm more of a cloud\nThis is actually a pumpkin ... from a wolf creek brewery so you know it's a\nDraft you know ... ... brewery has been existence actually this year they became of age they're Twenty one years old\nAnd so on their glasses that they say no crap before it was cool [laughter] so they were one of the original there are in our area definitely and that's a pumpkin wise and that they make every year and is very popular ... nice has a little\nBit of a into sentiment in a little bit finished there at the end\nThat has those those notes that liquid fall yeah that's lovely you know I I hear a lot of things a lot of a beer folks are like I'm not going to have a pumpkin beer but really if you trace back the history of beer a pumpkin and those those particular spices to send them in um\nA course you've got closer you get a nutmeg those types of things those were in beers pretty early on\nOh ... oh definitely curry under a is one of the spices that is being used a lot in a in why ... you know uh so that it it's definitely one of my favorite beers from Belgium because of um I was born in Belgium\nIs a wild east beer called ... which is a cherry beer\nAnd it's actually one of the hardest beers to make a because it involves a wild ... that's in the air around that area there so uh so yeah it does some of these beers you know sometimes people go oh oh nothing fruity for me but there's a difference between the fruit taste being added you know to a beer\nIf somebody ... that it can buy doesn't it really doesn't uh we've itself to the entire body of the bee or it's beer with flavoring right whereas this is something that has it's been orchestrated the yeah the fruit as part of the process you know while that's\nYou know I have um I was diagnosed with ... years ago and mine tends to flare up with beer which is not a happy thing by the way um but I've lived with it thinking oh well you know what I ... just back off you know a beer much drinking these\n...
