reasonable a lot to do out there and we're thrilled to be partnering with them again this year the seasons have changed or\nSort of I Know of Southern California the weather's always gorgeous were super lucky to live out here even though we're taxed the eyeballs\nOr it's gorgeous all the time and I know that gets a little chillier though ... just a tiny bit of chill in the air to make it feel like fall and you start raving\nCertain foods right like soups or Chile or stews and so I Want to I talked with Gary uh this past week ah or this this week on Tuesday um during tasty Tuesdays that I Do with Gary Shannon every Tuesday at one thirty two\nAnd we were talking about chili and I got through some of these but didn't get through all these years these are tips for\nAh my tips for really good chili and this is stuff that I've learned over the years through you know cook's illustrated and talking to chefs and these types of things\nUh spices when you're dealing with spices even if they are commercially ground stuff that you get to the grocery store in the aisles there things like chili powder try cooking them and a little uh butter or oil this is called blooming\nIt makes them deeper makes them more potent ... the flavor compounds in these things things like time Rosemary a stage bay leaves\nA they're largely fat soluble so just briefly heating them in a pan\nOr the spices herbs in a little bit of fat in a pan goes before you put it into liquid and everything that goes a long way really brings out that intensity and is going to add a depth and layer and flavor to your chili that it might not otherwise prepping your vegetables\nThis is he your age\nYou've got to make sure your vegetables are properly perhaps so you're aromatic or whatever vegetables you using you want them in even sized piece is one of the\nSimplest most basic ways\nTo become better at what you do to be a better cook\nAdding something to a dish that is going to make it more pleasing is making sure all the sizes\nUm the cut to prep the vegetables are all the same size they'll cook more evenly every bite will be better\nAnd also if you cook them you know have smaller pieces you're going to get a little bit of everything in each by which is going to make for the best buy if certain things are huge yeah you look at it you go hey it's rustic and get that but now you might get two things in there instead of four or five\nDifferent things in that kind of around out the flavors so make sure you do that or when you're cutting vegetables make sure that they're roughly the same size\nAs far as meat goes we talked about baking soda can help make the meat in your chili juice you're very simple chemical reaction going on here so if you're tossing a beef with a mixture of water salt and baking soda you let it stand for about twenty minutes it's going to raise the ph balance\nOf the meat and that means it's proteins are going to hold onto liquid more water there it'll also speed up the I Know here comes Brian suits the main yard reaction so the meat will brown more quickly and you want to do that prior because if you just put the meat in there and it kind of boils the meat\nIt's not as flavorful really what makes meat flavorful is that browning reaction that nice criminalization on the outside right so you do that prior it'll get speed up the process by using little baking soda little ... water a little salt\nUm and uh putting it in a pan you get that nice and brown and that's going to add flavor to your entire dish uh I Know people are always looking for ways to cut\nYou know fat or calories out of a dish but I got to tell you if you're going to make good chili try and stay away from things like ground chicken it just it is it intends to get rubbery\nIf you want to put chicken in Chile great use skin on chicken breasts you want to brown the chicken first or you can poach it in a mixture of bras um to give it flavor and then when it's done cooking remove it cool it pulled the meat off in shreds of meat and put it in\nRight because then you won't have that weird kind of ground\nChicken rubbery who's\nAlso don't skimmed the the fat off the top of your chili when you're making it from scratch you'll get that kind of orange slick at the top\nLot of people take that off don't do it that step dad as flavors dirt back in\nAnd then finally for our vegetarian friends make sure that you're using things that that uh have that mommy that that savory\nTexture and flavor to them so it just because you don't have you know meeting there doesn't mean you can't have a good vegetarian chili some of my favorite chilies are vegetarian or vegan\nThat they can be fantastic just make sure that you are looking for things ah that bring that mommy that rich meaty flavor like soy sauce or tomatoes are mushrooms\nAll of those things can boost your vegetarian or vegan chili and kick it up a notch and make it even better\nAll right ah well come back with
