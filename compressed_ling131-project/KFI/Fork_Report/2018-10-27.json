hearing\nAbout food dyes and allergies and how everything is going to kill you and harm you and it's unhealthy and\n... let's dispel a few minutes first of all sugar doesn't make kids crazy sugar doesn't make kids hyper that's an absolute and complete mess there is zero science behind that really absolutely\nThe thing that tends to make that people attribute it to is in logic you you're you have to look at 'em eh eh correlation is not causation so just because something is happening\nRight next to or just after doesn't mean that it's happening because of so if I were to sneeze and there was an earthquake you wouldn't assume that the earthquake was because of my sneak CSI would well if I and maybe if I was running down the hallway and might think that but his knees should do it\nHowever people tie these things together and don't look at what else is there what else is usually in a you know the company of sugar a birthday party a special event um other there's other things

depends what Moody's and then how rare the thing is or or if it's just something that he enjoys it doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be a you know something\nA\nSugary so when it comes to candy I ... I think we grew up fine I think it'd be the illustration that Amy king gave is like point for point\nMike but what I grew up with the emptying out of the candy the parents sifting through it um anything opened a anything look tampered with or whatever it was\nIt it left it was out of there and then you know we went ahead and\nEither they would partitioned it off and say you could get a certain amount here or as we got older you know ... you have to learn to gauge yourself and\nHave that battle as a child over wanting to\nKeep the candy and then to eat the candy you always want to keep and eat the candy yeah but you're wrestling with both ditch the have your cake and eat it too right um it just is one of those things that I think it's a rite of\nPassage of sorts and doesn't mean that I think kids should eat everything and you shouldn't be careful if they a peanut allergies or anything like that and yes there are alternatives that I read in the story that I thought were were fun glider airplanes I remember those the little also would ones that you could get a\nSeven eleven or was it was her Halloween\nWell some people would it as alternative um if you give you know little bouncing ball or something like that many flashlights are stickers or hated all those things I think they're fine you know it depends if you're in the mood for global or bracelets are pretty cool to spider rings are pretty cool\nNow but kids are gonna want candy yeah and what you don't want to do is build up the the desire and the want so much because I remember as a kid thinking man adulthood is being able to eat cake in the morning adult who's like nobody telling you what to do\nAnd that kind of ... that\nThat push and pull thing I think can be have the opposite result I think sometimes that doesn't mean that you shouldn't be aware of what your child puts in their body of course a but this kind of hyper focused where\n...\nWhere are you trying to put a kid in a box and keep them from Halloween or from any of these experiences as always seem strange to me by now everything in moderation yeah including moderation ... exactly at his the fork report let's get the latest news now with Amy king of the KFI newsroom\nPeople have been killed in a synagogue in Pittsburgh the shooting at the tree of life synagogue last six others heart including for police officers the suspected shooter was also shot several times and has been taken into custody President Trump says the shooting is more devastating than anyone first thought and says it's terrible what's going on with hate in our country\nOr the next several days and weeks to look at everything in the suspect's license home vehicle to social media and his movements over the last several days\nJones says officials believe that people killed today were murdered simply because of their faith\nLA city police have stepped up patrols around the city's synagogues because of the shooting LAPD officials say the move was made out of an abundance of caution authorities say there does not appear to be a connection between the Pittsburgh shooting and LA that average people in LA to report any suspicious activities at synagogues\nEighteen people are being rescued off the coast of San Diego after a yacht collided with a fishing boat that collision happened just last night off imperial beach\nOne critically injured person was airlifted to the hospitals and passengers were taken to San Diego bay coast guard boat others were ferried there on the yacht the fishing boat was reportedly badly damaged the Dodgers are back in the hunt for a World Series when after a record breaking three to win over Boston in Eighteen innings\nAnd win clinched by us solo walk home run by max Muncie at twelve thirty this morning months he says the seven hour twenty minute game it's a game changer\nThat time there was a ... game for both sides uh you know there's some extremely long game Eighteen ... a lot of pictures or use every position birds you\nFirst pitch tonight goes out at five nine just sixteen and a half hours after game three ended last night's contact with the longest in both game time and the ... innings in World Series history Boston leads series two games to one you can listen to all the action on our sister station and five Seventy LA sports traffic\nTime you're helpful so Cal hunted traffic centered ever what's that\nGoing to have a pretty serious ... an hour in riverside on than anyone east bound up before Madison Street multi ... in fact walk into two lanes and traffic jam solid from Van Buren and then also delays shall we ... we found a lot to do to drive your car crashes\nWashing the left lane ...

I'm not the epitome of health uh but\nUh and I like to eat all kinds of things however uh I Do understand a lot of the science behind why we eat what we eat and how it affects our body and I've often said that I get the juicing concept that get why people want to do at the convenience and things like that\nUm but the reason why either evolution or God decided to make the fruit the way it is is because\nUh that fiber is important part of the process and we ended up taking all the sugars and condensing them down and getting this massive jolt of sugar\nAnd none of the fiber of the things that are helping to move those ingredients as those nutrients through your body so that seems to be the the very thing that you're trying to do here is to combine the convenience without taking away on all those nutrients\nBingo and the other differences your body will metabolize whole fruit differently them and if an metabolize says juice go see your point juices basically a big sugar bomb um you know in the it's not a good thing for you this is completely different\nThis eats like whole foods right I mean literally what you got in there\nIs and if you ... you look at the label you'll see it's the cleanest label you're going to find a store or organic carrots organic fresh pineapple oriented dried pineapple organic caches but you can see it but I can see all those ingredients in here right because if we just cut 'em up and then we find them together with chia and coconut and a little bit of dried orange\nSo as I say you don't have time to real food are too busy to prepare it you open one of these and you've just gotten you know a carrot and some pineapple and cash shoes and all that stuff we just make it into something you can hold on one hand\nOkay this is delicious thank you and I applaud you for that is that's not always an easy thing to do but\nI Am I'm gobs smacked on how\nThe flavor is getting it there it does not taste artificial it does not taste um processed it didn't it taste like chunks of all those things right ah\nAnd I'm not sure what I was expecting but I wasn't expecting that and the fact that you can look and see I see strips of carrots in there right now um and then I'm tasting all those flavors individually and when you cook\nIt's not about just marrying flavors but you want them to be layered and to taste all of them and that's what I'm getting in a bar and and I don't know that I've ever had any experience like this quite honestly that is really amazing good for you\nThat's wonderful I mean that what you said is exactly what I Love to hear because our goal at the end of the day is to revolutionize packaged food um I I don't like eating Ninety nine point nine percent of packaged food I like eating real food and we want to but real food

corn Amy ...\nIs the thing I Love to hate why do people love to hate it so much because it's awful but I Love it and I eat at\n... that's weird hideous weird but see I don't hate it I hated it I mean why go yeah candy\nCorn in my back when I was a kid do\nAnd do I say that now no but I still bought ... marched on it and yeah it was down and I thought oh I should have\nSome more it I think it's a I think it's drunk\nYeah there is something about it in there it's it just does it it keeps on coming but it has become kind of\nA cool to hate eater dot com did an article in this case or will ski and we'll sky I guess we'll see we'll stay and\nShe's very funny 'cause she says that a much like the word moist and the music of nickel back candy corn is that cool thing day eight so ah there wasn't an article titled candy corn is garbage on dead spin and says that\nHobo serial murderers in Satan is the only people who like candy corn it has been called ... ear wax\nI'll come on yeah I Know right pretty nasty\nUm some people say they'd rather eat the crumbs are stuck in guy furious yeah these are go ti\nThan eat candy corn I don't get I don't get the anger\nI just I I ... why so angry about it because it's what I say like you don't really like it it looks pretty and you know and then you eat it and you go that's not very good that you keep eating it there's something sinister about this so Kay well I\nWe'll tell you something for something so sinister and for something that nobody likes has\nBeen around forever so you think of it this week Snickers\n... roughly Nineteen thirties ... Nineteen forties or two weeks imported from the Brits Nineteen Seventy nine candy corn Eighteen eighties and\nThat the color you just ... reference there pretty in the little layers and everything love the color can I tell you something that that technology and Eighteen eighty was all done so they have this molten mixture of ah you know all of the ... the\nGreat ingredients that go into candy corn so you know corn syrup fond didn't uh there is something called ... by the way and it isn't there a vanilla marshmallow cream different things right well they have molten their big molten vats\nOf that stuff in the three different colors and they'd have to hand to pour\nThe three different colors first white let it cool uh and then the orange let it cool and then the yellow but a cool\nSo that was all ... and no one was doing it at the time when you are very expensive and hard to duplicate so ... the fascination was based on how they looked strangely enough the whole candy corn look and feel it was actually a common cold or\nA chicken corn or chicken feed when it originally came out because uh at the time the Eighteen eighties almost half of the American labor force or farmers\nSo all the marketing heat or otherwise was always towards hers and that's why it had nothing to do with fall it was around kids ate it year round people ate it year round it wasn't 'til later after uh I think after World War I'm a\n... and you know into the twelve to Thirteen and ending they were just\nTrying to get a home run\nThey were just they were ... or ... they were taking away at at at at everything trying to just end the game\nSo very excited what'd you eat we hit that's funny that you asked that we at Dodger dogs yeah of course and we had peanuts and we had a cracker jacks\nNo just regular regular peanuts and we start our friend sitting next to his had one of these the ultimate dogs that they have where there it's like wrapped in bacon and I think it has like sauteed onions and stuff it looks really good smells really good as the sausage instead of a hot dog and we were like maybe try something new and it would just get\nThe ah the standards speak ... speaking of hotdogs LA's pinks and Boston spikes announced a charitable wager kind of interesting because you know a lot of times these uh ... city wages that go back and forth or for something silly\nYou know you have to do this or we have to do that but this one um is pretty cool so you've got these two legendary hotdogs stands opposite sides of the country that announced that they decided to go uh go there you know betting route\nBut instead of way during something Tutsi are silly both brand to put a five hundred dollars cash on the line if one of the city is one of the other cities uh one they would go to a local charities so that's pretty cool huh\nYeah that's good yeah rather than going and you have to you know where our colors or something like that they're putting their money where their mouth is so good on them of course we're hoping that uh spikes is the one that has to pay that out\nBut time will tell an and they've got a game not only tonight but tomorrow right\nMhm five oh nine first pitch tonight and then another game a five at Dodger Stadium tomorrow\nHoly smokes of course you can hear the all the games\nOn our ah friends down the hall at ... am five\nSeventy I'm Kelly seat but wow yeah just you wouldn't even get me interested like that you know that it's permeated into the cheap seats\nAl ... can I just give you one other aside from last night sure since you're the food guy yes yeah they said if they shut down the concession stands after the eighth inning\nWhat\nThere was nothing like you couldn't even get a water seriously mhm unless you were like in the dugout proper that really fancy seats are they still had sat but everything was closed down because they and they always closed down\nBefore the game is over and now we're like I'm part [laughter] we're all like the lines for the water right away he found opportunity oh yeah the good thing is you didn't have to worry about anybody think drinking and driving because the last year went out like three hours before the game was over\nWow yeah I heard some noise last night uh fireworks and things going off and then a lot of cheering in the neighborhood but\nA lot of love LA yeah they played that song at the end when when the ... it was it was fabulous but yeah I was like going okay it's time for like another Dodger Dog is time for maybe some ice cream or maybe some they had clam chowder last night and on our Boston in it they're nothing\nWow and that's where you can't bring anything into the park either Kenya\n[noise] I Can't remember if you can or not it seems like maybe you can\nInteresting they're not sure if they still allowed it and they give us yet\nI'm thinking about the Oregon is still plane and while that's got to be tiring the oh yeah for a fellows doing\nThe uh the reporting and everything like that and they've got to keep a but I didn't think that they would stop selling things you'd think they'd be ready to go you would think it was a\n... a a missed opportunity she said\nWow well that's ... that's why I like watching from home\n[laughter] I ...
