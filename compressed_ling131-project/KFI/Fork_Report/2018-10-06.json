Kelly and then after a milk Kelly\nYou've got dark secret place with the Brian suits than coast to coast am and then starts all over again tomorrow morning at five AM with Liz with us but those are so do no where\nAre we are talking to Lee a fair as owning a from semolina or or teasing all puffed up there in Pasadena she is a one woman band doing it all on her tiny shoulders uh I I'm impressed I think that's awesome the fact that you are so tenacious that you\nYou found it hard to find information about making\nWill be dried pasta\nExplain the difference between fresh made pasta in droid pasta 'cause it's not just typical freshman pasta drug right so what's the difference between right and fresh pasta\nSo they're they come from different traditions and if you think about it in the in the scope of history\nIn Italy I'm\nVery simplified northern pastas we're usually fresh whether eggs and there were because there was room for for animals to Rome and people had much much more money than in the south where the tradition is flour and water pastas\nAnd um the environment the climb the climate in southern Italy is much more attuned for drying pasta but it's still a a pretty\nModern phenomenon you know mid Eighteen hundreds to early Nineteen hundreds when they started getting enough knowledge to be able to figure out how to dry it because it's an automatic process you can't just sit outside and it'll all dry fine because of the outside drive too fast\nThe water gets trapped inside and you have\nWhat are we affectionately called broken spaghetti at work um which is pasta that that falls apart when you cook it because the outsiders to heart and there's water trying to get out from the middle\nAnd it starts to heat up in the hot water and starts pushing himself through the\nExactly so there's all sorts of science that I've had to learn on the fly um I never thought I'd be learning servo dynamics as a as a poet and a journalist but you know it works um\nBut so so you start with that you start with that tradition um and\nThe shapes are generally dictated by region um but everything that I Do is flour and water simply I only use semolina which is from hard Durham wheat\nOr the hardness helps give the pasta it's bite texture but it um doesn't actually develop elasticity the gluten doesn't really develop the same kind of elasticity that other flowers do and so\nIt it helps give the pasta it's texture as well what is the protein level um or an semolina it it varies\nBut it's usually eleven percent or higher um so it just depends on on where it's grown I'm which my my flower usually comes from North Dakota and Montana\n[noise] um and it also depends on that particular growing season and last organic flower tends to have a little bit lower a protein levels than conventionally grown and I use a hundred percent um organic flower\nWow and so that whole process of ... ... when you're you have a have to have a quota system that you can control too because here in although we don't have a whole lot of seasons there is time more there's more moisture in the air than others and baking is susceptible\nMolina says no pasta my website semolina pasta
