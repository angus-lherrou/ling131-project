Los Angeles Orange County and I are radio station [noise]\nRemembering my dad I mean you can live from the ... twenty four hour news around\n\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question which I'll answer later on the show bell kind of leave it with you a and the question is if you if you had to of course you don't want to but if you had to\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money at age sixty\nOr at age Seventy five\nWhich one do you think would be better age sixty or Seventy five\nAnd a if you answer like most people do you got it wrong [laughter] so so we'll talk about that now you don't wanna jak most shows would actually stopped there that's a ... show that is chock full of great in the right and so most sales would just stop there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to\nOf course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till\nWe're going to have our estate tip of the week\nAnd normally that's you know that's the part of the shall we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor\nBut this week we're going to talk about how to educate your greedy and washed undeserving heirs and so we're gonna talk about paying for college and not having to pay a gift tax okay because the IRS [laughter] [noise]\nYeah those guys they want the tax gifts and\nCollege in most cases has more is is is expensive and you don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are a we think the boys and girls clubs as one as a charity that uh\nYou know really helps young people to the to become solid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society in a positive way have a better life\nAnd so we are a benefactors of that\nAnd over the last six years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've sponsored a program that's called a sponsor a child [laughter] and uh so we want to raise money for that and last weekend we had the gala at a ... in in Plano in North Dallas and uh\nWe raised over a three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is it is\nReally really something it's amazing how\nYou know if you put some energy into something good things can happen well let's talk about two thousand seven\nUm you know are we we have as I mentioned they sell strategy or we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have the cell strategy and it's because the people that we work with primarily are you know ... they work their entire life you've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you got to preserve it\nAnd so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve will be have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells of philosophy we have certain criteria that\nSays it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet uh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven\nAnd what I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens is that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to your cell signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right you know you don't like being wrong obviously\nA and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand eleven our strategy said to sell both of those were very very near to bury markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and where and\nAnd so technically those were you know bad calls if you will but if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Nineteen percent in two thousand eleven so that's not too bad but the U.S and pay 'em\nBut did it as it may\nThose two which we call false alarms I was very convicted that that was the right thing I was like yes our strategy is right it's going to kill it we're going to be right this time perfect wonderful I'm Glad we're getting out\nAnd are those turned out to be near misses or they were close to a bear market but they weren't and the market rebounded quickly after that but in in uh in November of two thousand seven\nWhen that one came I was like oh no I Hope we don't you know I didn't want to sell because it felt like the economy was generally okay it felt like things were generally okay there was a lot of bad news everywhere\nYou know it was the new news wasn't great but it wasn't terrible and so I was very feeling that want to you know but of course we did and we we follow or discipline\nOf and then the same thing is how I feel now\nYou know you look at it we just got GDP numbers it looked pretty good you've got a you know the consumers and this and that and generally the all the indicators tell you things are are looking good right now\nBut yet our indicators telling us that we are close to getting ready to sell and I don't want to sell when things are looking good you know I don't want to be wrong but what's interesting is that that's how I felt to two thousand seven and of course so maybe I have a contrary indicator when I think it's right and wrong and what I think it's wrong I'm right\nToday in orange\nDoes NATO So he went to help you to build a plan to address the next credit cry market crisis when it comes\nAnd so you can get

with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon\nAnd we currently work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states we are blessed we are honored and in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top one hundred wealth managers\nAnd uh that's a thing we're proud of but without our clients we'd ... probably wouldn't even have noticed we were on the map so thank you all your clients that are listening to the show and those of you who are not yeah there you go that's will kiss\nFor those of you are not clients or if you're over fifty if you're retired or retiring soon\nI invite you to go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net and\nWhen you were there we have a everything we can think of to put on the website to help you to plan your retirement okay so do their mind about Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff well this is the second to the show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that\nSo here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five refrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still receive delayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent\nSo if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security uh journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase\nSo the question is if I enroll in Medicare at sixty five but I don't collect so screwed I wait till I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits\nThe answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but not the other way around okay if you fall for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part a alright\nSo a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and his eighty years old\nAnd he applied for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited Fifteen escape twenty Fifteen Years okay so if he applies now well his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get\nSix months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth and it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know if you think about six months that age eighty ah with all the delay credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for it yeah okay so in a ... it's kind of person born in Nineteen\nFifty to repay his Social Security benefits to ... or received to date and then re file to obtain a higher current pay out okay so it's my understanding that uh I can do so but uh I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter]\nThat's good so here's the answer if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and re filed okay so there's no need to go down and asked the local Social Security administration worker okay you just file ss aid form five Twenty one\nSo so if you're if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they paid you and then re file later All right\nSo that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question [noise] or whatever you had this talk with Tom I Am too\nSo um as I mentioned uh we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things that ah that requires we want to help you with so uh we had seminars that I'd like for you to go

strategies that you can use to reduce your income taxes during your retirement we're going to talk about how to maximize your cash flow alright so once you retire you want to get income from your investments where'd you get it from that kind of stuff\nOr we want to talk about should you roll over your four one K. um when should you take Social Security when you're sixty two when you're sixty six when you're Seventy when's the best time to do that we want to talk about the fact that the IRS\n[noise]\nMan she's afraid of that I arrest guy [laughter] I Can't blame her or the IRS wants to tax eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits did you know that eighty five percent\nSo we went [noise] I agree\nAnd you know what we want to show you how to beat that if it is a tall possible
