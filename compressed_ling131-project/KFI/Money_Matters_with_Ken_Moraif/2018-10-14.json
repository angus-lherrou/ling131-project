it and your job is done our view of that is that it's it's an incomplete strategy\nYou need to have a third part to that which is you need to have a cell strategy and that's why you know is is that we told our clients to sell in November of ... to stay out for all of two thousand and eight and then even half of all night and we didn't say to buy until June of old nine\nSo we're we're we're by

I've been a certified financial planner professional now for the last\nTwenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and we not work with over a thousand four hundred families\nAre in in forty three states and you know what it never ceases to our and me and in

advisory firm money matters one of the top three hundred\nRegistered investment advisors for the second time this year okay so that's and that's quite an honor and we're very proud of that but you know what without our clients we would be nowhere so I give that to them and we are affirmed that specializes in working with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or retiring soon so we we look at retirement planning as our primary focus\nAnd so that's you we love to help you if we could and you can go to our website to find out all about us and we have tons of stuff on there for you we have podcasts and videos and articles all about the topics of a retirement planning\nAnd uh the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there so let's talk about Social Security and one of the areas the probably the most important\nA decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is\nWhen do you apply for benefits okay and it's not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed any time between the ages of sixty two and Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\n[noise] that was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits if the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start okay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time\nYou start when you're sixty six they'll pay you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to wake you're Seventy they'll do that even again\nSo what happens is they actually end up paying you the same total amount okay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a ... why would you want to delay it why wouldn't you take your sixty to\nThe problem is that most people will not outlive the will not let out an average life okay so uh you have to look at your life expectancy\nSo an average life means you live to be eighty six currently I think is the uh is is is the life expectancy\nSo you know I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty you know and he's healthy and fine so so in his case you know we gotta look at longevity and how long it's going to be\nSo the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity\nAnd by delaying you lock up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get that higher benefit because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is the higher okay so if you delay there's a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you live to life expectancy is the same okay so something for you to consider now as I mentioned uh we do specialize in in in working with\nPeople who are retired are retiring soon and we look at uh we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning so if you are over fifty if you are retired or you are retiring soon [laughter]\nAnd we're here\nFor you and our goal is to help more people in retirement than anybody else that's what we want to do [laughter] so uh if you go to our website is

income taxes when you retire we'll talk about how to maximize your cash flow\nOkay so when you are retired is it in my opinion is all about cash flow you gotta make sure you have the cash coming in to
