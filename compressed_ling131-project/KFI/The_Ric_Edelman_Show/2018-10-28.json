securities off ... yes I guess he carries ... ... s IPC [noise]\nWhich was brought to you by candle financial services El Al [noise]\nTo send me your question by audio and\nThat's exactly what George dead here says question he sent to ask Rick and Rick Edelman dot com\nIraq this is George from California my in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stock investments since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation risk so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks face this question in my older years I'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and if money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed\nInvestments that they might not pay much interest I not only pay one or two or three percent but so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you tried to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of it could\nSo traditionally we would argue don't take any more risk than is necessary\nTo achieve your goals but let me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider\nA riskier investment strategy and their strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago\nPut the money into bills called today but think about this when you die\nWho gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren in other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast you and will ultimately be transferred to your\nKids and grandkids you could argue that that money really isn't yours it's ... and you are merely the steward of that money\nYou're the custodian your the caretaker of that money and if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind\nMeaning that if your son or daughter had the million dollars they invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that net of taxes\nAnd inflation is growing and real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age but based on ... and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk we're jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us ... sit down with one of my colleagues here at the firm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic look at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources\nAnd designed what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George thanks so much for your question and if you would like to have this conversation with us you can do so just call AAA to plan wreck or visit us online at rice element dot com\nYou know we've got some of the aftermath of Hurricane Florence and Michael we've
