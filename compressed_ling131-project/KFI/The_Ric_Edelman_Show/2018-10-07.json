you before we left that parents are spending five hundred billion dollars a year which is preventing them from saving and investing\nGuess what they're spending that money on according to a new study by age wave parents are spending five hundred billion dollars a year\nUnder Eighteen to thirty four year old children\nThey're spending on their adult kids twice as much as what they are contributing to their retirement accounts two thirds of parents say they have to sacrifice their own financial security for the sake of their children who were in their twenties and thirties\nSeventy three percent say that they factor their finances into the decision of becoming a parent in the Nineteen eighties only thirty three percent of people in their twenties and thirties did that the average cost of raising a child today is now about a quarter of a million dollars\nNine out of ten parents say they're surprised at how much money they spent\nBy becoming a parent\nAnd nearly two thirds say they encounter financial difficulties associated with parents and\nEven children who are living independently are receiving financial support from their parents parents are contributing to school costs health insurance rent car expenses parents or even paying for food and for cell phone service for their adult children\nThe numbers are rather astonishing\nThirty one percent of Americans who were ages Eighteen to thirty four thirty one percent we're talking basically one at a free of people in their twenties and thirties or living with their parents we actually have more people who in their twenties and thirties living with their parents than living with a spouse\nThat is something new and different for the society\nParents are saying they're not going to be off the hook\nAnytime soon fifty nine percent say they expect to help pay for their children's weddings okay nothing new about that mom and dad have been paying for their daughters weddings for pretty much forever but twenty six percent say they're expecting to contribute to their children's first homes\nThirty three percent expect to contribute to their grandchildren's college costs so it's not just you're paying for the wedding for the kid you're paying for the house you're paying for their kids' education as well\nAnd here's what's really shocking an amazing about this the reason the parents are providing so much financial support to their kids is because the kids are unable to handle this on their own independently maybe it's because kids didn't grow up with any financial education they are financially illiterate\nAnd yet about sixty percent of parents said that they taught their children the benefits of investing or really\nOnly half of teenagers agree with that statement so mom and dad you might think that you have given your kids the information that they need to begin investing but\nChances are you're wrong about that changes are your kids don't agree that you have given them the information in education and device in counseling that in fact that they need is it any wonder\nThat three fourths of parents wish that they had help teaching their children about investing hello here I Am\nAnd so I'm really excited to remind you that we have a new book for children on money\nThe squirrels manifesto is being published by Simon and Schuster it's being released in November it's our first children's book Jean and I wrote it together we collaborated with ... who is a fabulous artist he's a former animator for Disney he did such movies the lion king and beauty and the beast and others and\nIt's lavishly illustrated I'm not sure the contents great but they are is fabulous and we're really excited that this is our first children's book aimed at kids three to six years old\nSo that it's designed to help you teach your children and grandchildren the basic fundamentals of what's most important about money and your children's lives we need to make sure that our kids are growing up correctly and parents you need to recognize\nThe old school notion that when you know the kids are out of college they're out of my life financially that is not likely to be true you need to recognize your financial support of your children is likely to continue for another decade or two\nAnd you need to factor that in to your financial planning\nAnd it's rather amazing I'm going to ask you this question do you know the meaning of the phrase savings account you know what that is I'm sure you do eighty eight percent in a recent survey knew the answer to savings account Seventy six percent could explain what a credit union is\nSeventy two percent know what a ... worth is by the way network you're not sure since thirty percent or not you take everything you own and you subtract everything you oh so you take for example your house my miss the mortgage balance\nThe parents are damaging their own financial security for the benefit of their kids and that their kids are scared that they're not going to be able to accumulate enough money on their own\nThere's another survey that shows the reversal of this that it's going back up a line\nSixty four percent of teenagers according to a new survey by junior achievement sixty four percent of teenagers are concerned about their\nParent's ability to retire so in other words mom and dad you're doing a great job doing whatever it takes to support your children\nAnd you know what your children know it even to the point that your teenagers are worried about your financial future\nAnd what's really so fascinating about this whole thing is that even those sixty four percent of teens two thirds are worried about their parents preparedness for retirement\nSixty nine percent of teenagers\nSay they know little or nothing about financial planning well actually I think they know a lot more than they realize if they're worried about their parent's ability to save for retirement and their parents ability to in fact retire in financial comfort in security well that's what financial planning is all about and teenagers are looking at you mom and dad\nAnd they're worried about you\nFirst of all I think there's something a little bit wrong with our country of teenagers are worrying about their parents' financial security but that's a whole another conversation but here's the problem\nTeenagers in fact as we pointed out earlier in the program today they know very little about personal finance one third\nOf teenagers according to the survey by junior achievement one third of teenagers I Hope you're sitting down for\nThis and if you're driving the car you might want to pull over as I give you this is historic one third of teenagers believe they will need less than five thousand dollars in order to retire [laughter]\nOh my goodness gracious they think they're going to need five grand or less in order to retire\nA hello I'm so clearly kids have no reasonable conception of what life costs they don't understand how expensive car czar or houses or food or health insurance\nThey have no clue and you know why because mom and dad you haven't told them a thing\nSo my recommendation my advice for you mom and dad is next time you sit down to pay your bills have your teenager sit along side you have them write the checks on your behalf out of your checking account when you're balancing your checkbook let them participate\nIn games with them when it's time you go talking about investments include them in the conversation your kids are worried about this and maybe they don't need to be as worried\nYou know kids are grown up with a lot of stress and strife they've got challenges dealing with issues you and I never had to deal with when we were growing up school shootings and and massive drug epidemics and uh oh my goodness gracious the whole political environment and yet\nThe last thing we need to do is to pile on with them worried about your\nRetirement security so I think the time has come to eliminate that last taboo in American society you know we're willing to talk politics with our kids ruined his talk religion with our kids were willing to talk sex with our kids it's time we started talking about money with our kids as well\nHey let's go to our asks Rick segments as you know You're welcome to send me your questions and an audio file just use your smartphone to record your own voice send it to me by email to ...\nAt ... dot com we had two questions this week on the very same subject which is kind of weird but here's the first one from caster you remember him he's from Brazil you call this a couple of weeks ago there was a castor has to say\nHi Ray cares Custer again from Brazil you seems a little bit surprised with the fact that you're listening to all sides of the U.S\nBut I think it really showed that because of course I don't pay much attention when they talk about for a one case Roth IRAs and stuff like that because the roads here are totally different but\nI Do a better opinion when it comes to principals like financial responsibility a diversification editor location dollar cost averaging or or in my case ... and my question is about one of those general principles budgeting\nIf I'm not mistaken you said here in the shows that budgeting is not a very good use of some of the time\nBut the wealth take a look at my case for instance I have two daughters one is eight or so they're all they're run these two years old the youngest one was good for profit school next year just like they do this so far as being able to save a little more a little above twenty percent of my income\nBut was this extra ... if I don't make any adjustments or want to be able to save as much and I'm going to be saving about tough as much of a lot on saving all end all I'd like to avoid it with an ...\nAn started to work on my budget for two thousand Nineteen so I can see where it can cut the expense of my income is pretty much in study I Can't do much about it\nI Know is is not enough just to promise to myself I'm much I'm going to spend every most but it isn't a place to start\nSome listeners may be facing a similar situation and it suggests that for us make a budget turnout thanks our time\nWas that was cast her with a really good question about budgets ten had the very same question let's listen to him\nHigh rate this is Tim from Santa Barbara California\nI Know you don't like budgets I've been listening to you for a long time to blanket statement that I don't agree with and been budgeting myself for Thirty years and it's worked very very well for me I understand your position is that most people just can't stick to budget [laughter] okay fair enough but most people can't stay tuned in to tell you the truth [laughter] so\nTo me a budget is essential especially for retirement planning you have to do pro forma budgeting [laughter] maybe you could explain your condition a little bit more than that I Would really appreciate it\nWell I'm happy to reply to both ah both of you tend to cast her thanks so much for your aspirin submission and yeah it's it's a big deal because we all are raised on the importance of a budget and frankly it's a waste of time I know that is what you disagree with hearing me say but here's why I say\nA budget is a promise on how you're going to spend money\nAnd we all know that life gets in the way I'm sure you're not budgeting for the fact that your car might break down in six months you're not budgeting for a medical issue that you don't know you're going to incur you haven't budgeted for a job loss you haven't budget\nIt's for your sister announcing she's getting married and you not only have to buy address but you've got to buy an airline ticket to go to the wedding and you're going to have to buy a president and you're going to have to have to have to have to life gets in the way unexpectedly and that's why budgets rarely work out\nSo there are two things I Want you to do instead of budgeting that are far more effective\nFirst\nInstead of telling me how you're going to spend your money which is what a budget is you're telling me what you're going to do I want you to go backwards and your checkbook for the past six months or even better one year\nAnd show me how you did spend your money because I'm willing to bet that how you did spend your money over the past year is how you're pretty much going to spend your money over the next year it'll be a far more accurate analysis of what you can reasonably expect your expenses to look like\nSecond decide first and foremost up front how much money you're going to save for the future\nHow much you're going to save for retirement how much are going to say for college how much you're going to save for say home buying or buying a boat or whatever it is you want to save for you tell me how much money you're going to save and in fact more importantly you go ahead and do that once you're saving enough money to achieve your goals\nI don't really care how do you spend the rest of your money it doesn't matter anymore\nBecause you've already saved in other words pay yourself first ... once you save money\nYou can then spend all the rest of your money and don't worry if you run out of it did you ever noticed that you run out of money the end of the month\nThe problem is you run out of money before you've saved for your future so if you treat yourself as a bill if you treat yourself as a creditor you must pay by participating in your retirement plan at work or sitting in a mutual fund or who knows what then\nThe rest of it goes away and the need for budgeting disappears it's as simple as that know by the way to him\nIf what you've been doing has been working for you\nGreat keep on doing it my concern is that people are engaged in behaviors that aren't working and all they do is feel badly that they're not sticking to their budget or that they haven't been able to show the discipline to do what they need to do\nAs you listen to the advice and information on this radio show you're not supposed to do whatever it is you hear me say we're supposed to do is evaluated analyze it debate it with your spouse decide if it's applicable to your situation and if it is\nThat's Edelman financial dot com slash review\nStay with us for more here on the Rick idleman show AAA to plan wreck online at rice Feldman dot com\nAnd a very happy Sunday to you welcome to the Rick Edelman show here on KFI am six forty a special broadcast today because I'm On the coast\nIn San Francisco so broadcasting from a local studios here very excited to be in the bay area I'm here for a variety of meetings and conferences the tub around CEO some it is on Monday and so I'll be\nA speaking at that and attending uh with uh some of the a C suite executives and the financial services industry from around the country\nAn invitation only event I'm really glad to be out here for that and to spend time in the bay area which I Love to do um\nWe've got some really good news coming out of the financial sector and ah I'm not sure if you're fully aware of what's going on because I'm not sure that you've been participating in it to\nLose you could argue is actually a little bit mixed of the uh the yield on ten year treasuries is now at the highest level in seven years yeah we've exceeded the interest rate on ten year treasuries since two thousand eleven\nNow people would say ordinarily well gee ... you know higher yield better because that means I'm earning a higher rate of return on my bonds no because if the deal goes up that means the interest rate is up\nThat means the value of the bond is down so if we're at the highest interest rate since two thousand eleven means we're at the lowest price since two thousand eleven uh and that is not good news if you own long term bonds and that is why you've got to be really careful about your investment strategy\nA but I you know there's another statistic that's that's really fascinating at the same time the Dow Jones industrial average hit an all time high earlier this week\nIt gave some of that back later on in the week but the fact that at the stock market is continuing to hit new highs while the bond market is struggling to avoid losses due to interest rate increases\nDemonstrates that is as is usually the case in the world of investing it's a tale of two cities and it's really important that you recognize this and maintain a highly diversified investment portfolio last week I talked about the fact that\nHighly diversified portfolio doesn't guarantee against losses that doesn't mean you're going to always have above average returns in fact it's probably going to mean you're going to get kind of average return to fats how you've invested and this year in particular is a kind of a wacky year because although\nValue stocks normally do better than growth stocks that's not the case this year although foreign stocks usually do better than us stocks that's not the case this year\nUh and and so\nWe also find that that energy stocks are down gold stocks a gold itself is down\nA so we were finding that a diversified portfolio isn't performing the way that the ordinarily you might assume it would early space history would suggest to us that uh that it would in fact we're seeing highly concentrated investment results\nSix stocks in the S. and P. five hundred\nHave accounted for forty percent of the total profits this year in the U.S in pay six out of five hundred\nAre you able to pick the six that matter oh can I and that's kind of the dilemma and this is why we maintain our position\nAnd why we continue to recommend for you on this radio show that you should invest in a diversified fashion and one of the best ways to do that is using exchange traded funds\nThese E. T. S. or relatively new they've only been around a couple of decades compared to mutual funds has been around since the Nineteen twenties and each he asks are simply a cheaper version\nOf an antiquated retail mutual fund they generally you know you don't have to pay commissions to buy them there are very low expenses there's also generally very low turnover which means the annual tax liability is very low\nAnd each he asked we believe simply offer a better alternative in many cases for many investors and as evidence of this I mean I I've been promoting in ... I don't know what Fifteen Years\nAnd we are in fact finding that back in ... there was about a half a trillion invested in each yes that was you know ten years ago\nIt's not half a trillion it's three point four trillion dollars that investors have placed into ATF\nAnd that is exciting it shows that hey you're getting the message that's that's really fabulous you're paying attention to diversification you're paying attention to investment costs are and you're staying up to date with the investment opportunities which maybe aren't the same as what you grow up with what you were familiar with\nBut you've accepted the need to adapt\nAnd stay current with the market place so I think that's a really very exciting\nOr is it\nBecause if we take a look at data that has just come out from a recent survey\nSo if we go back ten years ago to the credit crisis of two thousand eight you know it's great that ATF skyrocketed in in value from five hundred billion to three point four trillion you know part of that as market appreciation of course but a big part of it is your contributions into ATF says well\nBut not everybody's been\nTaking advantage of that and I'm not just saying that they're not taking advantage of each shift themselves they're not taking advantage of investing at all\nTen years after the crisis we discover according to this latest survey research the twenty seven percent of Americans stopped saving for retirement they stopped contributing\nTo their four one K. entirely they were so spooked by two thousand eight they'd lost so much money so rapidly\nThat scared them out of the markets apparently for ever twenty seven percent one out of four Americans no longer saving for their future and fourteen percent have continued to save what they're doing so in\nCash oh my goodness so instead of\nWatching their investments triple and values since two thousand nine I mean that's what the stock market has done it tripled and value instead they've been earning less than one percent a year because that's what you know bank accounts have been paying for the last ten years zero point nothing only ten percent of people in the survey invest more today than they were\nIn two thousand eight two thirds are saving less today than they were and\nAlmost eighty percent say they can't explain what happened in the financial crisis they don't get it they don't understand what occurred\nAnd so it's no wonder that Seventy eight percent trust Wall Street less than they did in two thousand mate and only forty one percent say they feel fully recovered financially in the face of an economic expansion unraveled in American history\nWith the stock market tripling and values since its steps of two thousand nine\nThe majority of Americans still say that they earn behind where they were ten years ago and you know what the biggest crisis is about all of that\nEverybody's ten years older everybody's ten years closer to retirement and that's the big problem\nAnd just permeates through out American society regardless of age group according to another survey forty six percent of millennials said they believed that they need at least a thousand dollars to start investing Seventeen percent say they think they need at least ten thousand dollars\nTo start investing that's simply true anymore due to advanced technology you can invest\nYou can open an account with the dollar not a thousand not ten thousand I'm not suggesting you should necessarily do that before you joined your retirement plan it worker before you pay off credit card debt or before you Bill cash reserves but the point is it doesn't take a lot of money anymore to build investments\nAnd oh by the way\nA lot of parents are are not saving a lot either it's not just the millennials but the millennials parents that aren't saving a lot and you know one big reason for that\nI'm going to tell you when we come back\nHere on the Rick idleman show I'm going to tell you\nWhat it is that parents are spending five hundred billion dollars on every single year and no it's not their kids who are on the playground K. through twelve ... it's not raising children that are the parents are spending a lot of money on\nIt something else and I'm going to tell you what it is when we come back on the program so you can figure it out\nBefore we return and we're going to tackle that in a whole lot of other fascinating information including the latest investment opportunities you probably always wished you could get a pizza but never had the opportunity to\nYou'll

trust fund and the fact that it's slowly being depleted well some would say not so slowly over the next ten to twelve years it's going to be wiped out\nThat trust fund is at risk of being completely depleted and that's kind of implications not only for American retirees but American taxpayers who might be asked to foot the bill for restoring the trust fund to it's needed levels dope has talked about all this\nAnd more importantly what's going on in the retirement security marketplace and what is the field of behavioral finance got to do with all this\nI'm happy to bring on to the program Brigitte ...\nWho's a professor of public policy in corporate management at Harvard University she's also Dina Brigham Young University of Maryland School of business Bridget thank you so much for joining us on the program\nIt's my pleasure to be here\nSo bridges also retirement commissioner of the bipartisan Policy Center she got her PHD in economics from MIT and it's a two time recipient of the ... award for scholarly research on lifelong financial security so\nBridget you're one of those experts that people like me love to quote love to talk about all the time so let me start with a little quiz you're you're going to know the answer to this but I Want to see how well our listeners doing this cute little quiz you're ready for this I'm ready\nSo if I were to give you a penny or one in ten chance to win ten cents which would you choose the penny\nOr the one in ten chance to win a dime\nMe I Would pick the one in ten chance to win a dime\nYeah I I think most of our listeners will agree with you on that now let me change the questioner here a little bit let's say I were to give you ten million dollars for a one in ten chance to get a hundred million now which would you pick\nNow I'd pick the ten million for sure\nAnd I think most folks would agree with you on that but here's the fascinating thing and of course you realize this in both cases the chances of success or one in town they haven't changed and since the one in ten hasn't changed your answer shouldn't have changed either\nClassic economics says the both should result in the same attitude but you've demonstrated a very different attitude between the penny versus the ten million dollars and that's the core of behavioral economics isn't it\nYeah that's exactly the court may rocking out next that uh the psychology with which we approach financial decision making often results and different answers that if we were to be purely rational logical and consistent with all of the financial choices we make\nAnd the crazy thing is that Richard Thaler won the Nobel Prize last year for his work and behavioral finance and also there was a Nobel one and two thousand two on the same subject but what took so long for the field of economics to figure this out\nThe fact that humans don't act rationally the markets aren't rational because humans are emotional creatures what took so long for everybody to figure that out why is it only just now finally becoming part of public policy\nThe interesting thing is if you go back and read Adam's back\nHis often cited as the father of modern economics you as a you know writing back in the Seventeen hundreds or he very much a behavioral economist in the Nineteen thirties and an attempt to to be taken more seriously\nI as a as a science kind of started using mathematical models with people being rational\nSo it's only been I you know more recently that has caused economist to to rethink their model of how people do make decisions as opposed to as opposed to how maybe they should make decisions\nGive me one example of how that's translated into the marketplace affecting ordinary folks\nAh companies are now moving towards automatic enrollment you're automatically enrolled in a savings plan unless you opt out the U.S is encouraging this\nAnd other countries that have gone and you know a step further so the u._k. several years ago a rolled out of pension for reform and they are requiring employers to use automatic enrollment and they've seen the fraction of their workforce that's participating in a retirement savings plan\nIncrease by more than twenty five percentage points and the span of four or five years\nAnd in fact just really does the same thing they have a nine and a half percent mandatory were contribution for their retirement savings for every employee in the country and so their savings compared to other nations is huge can these theories of personal finance improve how we think about Social Security and the challenges it's facing\nThe injuries and afflictions that surgeons dealt with were as varied as London's population itself\nThousands of workers migrated to the city each year not only with these people living

newspaper reported that almost a third of these injuries were caused by quote broken glass or porcelain casual\nFalls lifting weights and cautious use of spokes knives and other domestic implements unquote\nThese accidents often involved children wow compare\nTo life in the workplace today and let me share with you another statistic that was just released by the world bank this week the global population you've got about seven billion people in the planet right now\nAnd the global total people who are living in extreme poverty\nHas now fallen below seven hundred and fifty million for the first time since the world bank has been collecting data starting in Nineteen Ninety this is the decline of more than one billion people in the past twenty five years this is truly exciting we had\nOne point seven million in the extreme poverty now its point seven million and oh by the way what do they mean by extreme poverty\nPeople living on less\nThan a buck Ninety a day yeah we still have a lot of work to do but boy we making great progress so feel good things are excited\nWe're taking telephone calls here on the Rick Edelman show we're talking with Donald is an edge water Marilyn welcome to the show Donald how are you\nVery well thank you nice to talk to you too how can I help\nYou spoke recently of the many advantages of waiting until late Seventy to start collecting Social Security benefits right but you didn't mention two of the biggest reasons that I uh favorite and a one way to eight Seventy to get your benefits or\nIs it is true in a ... isn't very advantageous in the meantime uh after full retirement age at least your\nBenefits go eight percent tax free uh where where else can I get eight percent tax free\nVirtually guaranteed unless the government failed that's a good a good thing and even if you do not live long enough which seems to be a concern of many people to receive is much accrued benefit as if you had taken Social Security at sixty two\nUh if you do wait until towards Seventy or Seventy you're surviving spouse will get a much larger monthly benefit after you are no longer able to collect them\nI think you're raising really too too very important points Donald I'm really glad you did you get it and that's great are a lot of folks really don't the one thing I Would stress is not nearly that you are in this extra eight percent for every year delay starting at your full retirement age of sixty six that begins starting way back at age sixty two\nIn other words if you begin to collect benefits at age sixty two you get eighty percent of what your benefit otherwise would be and if you wait\nA year it'll be eight percent higher you wait another year early another eight percent higher every year all the way they eat Seventy so you're absolutely right there's tremendous value I'll call it delayed gratification many Americans are taking the money at sixty to\nSimply because they don't realize that they don't know that there's a huge economic value to delaying\nAnd so uh it is really interesting now there are some ... that we have to recognize\nThat could impact the decision for folks\nAre not least of which of course some people just frankly need the money they don't have the luxury of waiting eight more years to get their Social Security benefits but assuming it's optional for you\nYou've got to take into consideration several things number one are you still working or are you still earning an income because if you earn too much then you could lose some of those Social Security benefits either by claw backs from as I say war the Social Security administration or\nUh some of the benefits can be taxable so that's one factor another factor is that the benefit you receive could have an impact on what you pay for Medicare\nUh so we have to offset a the benefit you're getting versus the cost you might be otherwise incurring so there are complications that's a shame that the Social Security system is so crazily complicated\nBut fundamentally all of the factors being equal you're absolutely right Donald a great many Americans would be better off for so many years by delaying their Social Security benefits\nThis is like a double whammy it's a double benefit that I think you really can't match anywhere else so I'm really glad that you brought this up because uh you you you've been thinking about it a lot you you're right on the money\nAnd I wish everybody else is doing a good his job as you are and we'll pay close attention to what you're saying messages real simple\nBe really careful about when you begin your Social Security benefits do not assume you should take them as soon as you're eligible the longer you wait in many cases the better off you're going to be\nDonald thanks so much
