hundred and forty nine yards to Cleveland three hundred and Seventeen of course there were the two interceptions thrown by Baker may feel he ended up with two hundred thirty eight yards respectable on the day one touchdown pass a coming\nI Would argue in pretty close to the garbage\nTime there and then uh back at the end zone throw to Joe coup ah he was twenty to forty six to ... five hundred on the on the day in terms of his passing and uh do Johnson hadn't okay game to carries for thirty six yards\nAnd that's your look really at the stat line across the board or the call before this came in and I think it was money who said it during the pre game\nHe said whoever wins the turnover battles going to win this game which is you know really a truism whenever it comes to National Football league but\nWhat was especially pronounced about these two teams is that Cleveland walked into this game with Fifteen take away some of the season\nThey were leading the league in takeaways meanwhile the chargers had only turned over the ball five times they were forced in the league in turnovers and so you have to really immovable object on either side of the league and it looked like the chargers moved last\nOn this than the browns did and hopefully that's momentum you know just that can carry through not only eight into London against Tennessee but as we get deeper into the schedule the defense plate fantastic today and\nWhat's important about that is yet again playing without joy both finding ways to win without joy both are finding ways to pressure the quarterback without joy ... and you're different players stepping up like again it's just the overall theme with this team is all the guys that are stepping up in the absence of who I\nThere was there in this case you had strong play on the line but you also had strong play from from the defense of backfield and you know two interceptions for Desmond king is something that will be probably your career staff were him\nTwo interceptions and you had guys that have yeah cornerback and safety next to their name who are just flying up the field among them there when James ... five tackles\nAnd a half stack he needs one more sacked by the way if you get one more sacked\nHe breaks a record for the most ... by rookie deep into back in the NFL history and you know we're not even to the midpoint of the season guy just plain lights out and he looks fantastic every single day ... welcome back\nSecond half buddy after a four game suspension is making a making its presence felt on the field in that defense of interior that interior line which was lacking especially against the Russian attack earlier in the season\nAnd then in Damien square also coming up with the sack and a half a that happened when he shared earlier with a with their when James so good stuff for the defense and hopefully if everything goes according to plan we're going to get Joey boats back\nAt some point after the up by\nAnd then I'm scared I'm scared of this deep into all the way up and down\nSo instead of value being lost\nAt the season goes on you see a lot of teams are dealing with injuries and this has been the chargers ... since the dawn of time where you end up losing guys through the season to injury and the team just kind of eventually evaporated dissipates it turns into you know it's a defense or an off into its unable to performance duties instead\nIt's gaining steam it's gaining momentum gaining players\nAnd you could have the best defensive player in the national football league coming back after the by\nSo we're gonna talk a little bit more about this game and a and get to wrap and everything up hopefully here from Philip Rivers a little bit later as well um a couple of quick score updates before

by mid financial services L L [noise]\nCalls here on the record album show heading out to Troy, Michigan Paul's on the line you don't fall\nOn my question is about the option of taking a a lump sum a passion briefly I've been given the opportunity to take on and what did your input on it\nUh the question is whether you take the lump sum a or a series of monthly checks for as long as you live and uh it's it's an important question isn't it because once you give them your answer you're like stuck with it forever [laughter]\nSo that's it uh yeah it's like they're no reduce no do overs and such like that and that's why it's pretty vexing for a lot of folks\nThe good news is this it is\nStraight math in other words we simply want to look at\nHow much money they're going to offer you on a monthly basis\nVersus if we take the lump sum\nPay any taxes associated with that invest the rest how much income can we reasonably expect to produce from a an investment we make with that lump sum and is that money going to be equal to what you would have gotten from the pension\nSo the good news is all requires is a bit of math and I can tell you this usually\nWhen we do that math for our clients the answer is take the lump sum and invest it on your own to reduce your own monthly income usually not always but usually that is the more\nCost effective more economic uh the the superior answer given the two choices now I say usually and here's one big case where it's\nUsually not true of great or stretching our federal employees and the reason is that in some pensions\nThe pension amount you receive will grow over time they will actually increase the amount of income you're receiving sort of like Social Security increases this year they just announced that there will be a\nVery small Social Security increase for folks mostly about thirty or forty bucks for most Social Security beneficiaries\nUm so if you have a pension where were the monthly income you're receiving will rise annually than a clearly that are in most cases is the better choice but most pensions don't do that most pensions as a fixed amount\nWhatever they are giving you one day one is the same you're going to get ten years from now Twenty years from now Thirty years from now and that's a big reason for choosing the lump sum over the monthly pension because when you take the monthly pension\nThere are several pieces of fine print\nNumber one is I just said that amount will not rise which means overtime inflation will take its toll on the value of that monthly check\nThe the ability to buy goods and services diminishes because those costs rise but the check your receiving doesn't second is that when you die that pension benefits stops are you married Paul\nNo single okay so it's not an issue for you if you don't have a spouse or a partner you don't have to worry about that but for people who are married to have a partner a vet pension check stops when they die and that leaves a huge crisis for their surviving spouse\nOr so that's a consideration a that's not a problem for you so not as big a deal another major one is lack of liquidity\nOnce you take the monthly check that's all you ever get as a monthly check if you ever need access to the big bucket of money it's not available to you whereas if you take the lump sum now invested and generate your own income\nYou can increase that income whenever you want to keep pace with inflation you can reduce it you can start it stop it if you need a lump sum it's available to you you have greater flexibility and when you die whatever you didn't spend stays there for your heirs so the lump sum has greater flexibility that is often\nSuperior to taking the pension benefit but here's one final point in favor of the pension\nYou don't have to worry about your own habits in other words some folks if they are given the lump sum\nWill blow the cash and they will discover at some point that the money was spent on vacations and on jewelry on on big screen TVs on lottery tickets and beer and they have nothing to show for it in ten years and now they're in trouble whereas if they had taken the monthly check\nThey can be pretty confident that they will get another monthly check next month like Social Security checks and so they can protect themselves from their own\nA tendency to get my ... so you have to know yourself that you have to know can you be trusted to receive this lump sum manager permanently properly for your own personal benefit or will you be your own worst enemy\nAnd he would say the best thing to do is put in a A R a\nYes assuming you're eligible in most cases you argue roll the money over to an IRA and then you begin making withdraws from that account whenever you're ready to start taking it if you want it right away you can start if you don't need it for a while you leave it there until you do need it\nAnd you go from there so in order to find out the answer for sure we need to do that math we need to do those calculations to evaluate how much money is your employer offering you and can you reasonably expect to generate a similar amount of income from an investment strategy crate on your own\nAs I say usually the answer's yes we can do that but not always\nAnd that's why we need to go through the exercise we actually have an office in Troy on in your neck of the woods and so happy to sit down with you and go through this and detail looking at the amount of pension benefit your being offered and contrast that with a lump sum they're willing to give us an alternative to see what strategy is best in your situation\nThat sounds good so yeah but it is is like I said it's largely straight math that doesn't require a too much judgment will show you the spreadsheet analysis and say here's what yet this way and here's what you get that way which number looks better to you and it'll be pretty self evident\nYeah if you sit out the the growth uh especially I be taking at ten years before I ... for the fallout so there's a lot of room for growth that money\nAre in which case they're not likely to suffer any further significant declines in value\nOr are they elected to continue to uh experience declines with something that the interest rates continue to go up a wondering what your thoughts are on the uh on this topic\nCarrie thanks for your question uh yes you can reasonably expect that further increases in interest rates will create further declines in the value of bonds now a couple of caviar to this number one\nYes the markets do anticipate\nActions by the government in other words if it is clear if the government has sent messages which they sometimes do that they are going to do things the market's doing to dissipate that and they adjust securities prices based on that\nIn other words this is called a leading economic indicator and that's what the financial markets are they are leading indicators in other words they are pricing securities today based on what they think is going to happen as opposed to a lagging indicator\nThat occurs when prices are based on what already happened so the market as a leading indicator not a lagging indicator so yes to some degree prices are based on what everybody collectively things is going to happen but having said that\nWe are never really shore truly what is going to happen or when so while many people believe that the fed will continue to raise rates nobody's really sure when the fed will raise rates next or by how much and therefore bond prices are not fully baked in\nOn that answer so for that reason you can expect that there will be further declines in the bond market if there are further increases in interest rates second\nBonds react differently to interest rate increases depending on the maturity date the duration of the bond a thirty year bond will have a much bigger decline than a thirty day bond\nSo that makes sense the longer the duration the longer the maturity date\nThe greater the swing and value due to changes in interest rates so if you're fearful that there will be more rate increases then you should probably not own long term bonds\nUnless you plan to hold them to maturity if you hold on a mature you don't have to worry about it you'll get your money back at maturity regardless of what interest rates are doing but if you're thinking that you might sell your bond prior to maturity meaning you'll be subject to whatever market prices are being offered at that time\nThen you would probably want to own shorter term bonds rather than longer term bombs in our case we tend to recommend three or five years seven year majorities rather than twenty and thirty year majorities of for that reason\nSo yes you do need to be aware of this and this was something new and different for investors most folks are owned comfortable with unfamiliar with unaccustomed to\nInterest rate risk you know if we go back for the past forty years if we go back to the early Nineteen eighties interest rates have pretty much done nothing but go down\nAnd when rates go down bond prices go up so for a generation many people have grown up in an environment and not realizing that rates could go up not just down\nAnd they haven't been used to the fact that bombs could lose value because for the past since Nineteen eighty the bombs are pretty much done nothing but go up in value 'cause when rates go down bond prices go up or down a different environment\nGenerationally so a lot of folks are unfamiliar with us and that's why I'm Glad you raised your question because a lot of folks at the very same question\nDon't buy a bond unless you're planning to hold her to maturity if you're going to own a bond fund you should probably on bombs in that sons that are shorter immaturity rather than longer and to know exactly what kind of bombs are best for you\nAnd how much of your money you should be placing into them\nYou should talk with a financial advisor and we're happy to help you triple each plan Rick to tackle that question for you\nHere's another question and we got this on a lot of people's minds that comes from Mick here it is\nAll right Rick this is Mick more prone to answer a question about terrorists are hearing a lot about additional tariffs being applied all kinds of products and the fact that this is likely going to lead to an increase in prices for a number of the products that we consumers purchase\nMy question is where does all that turf money go does it go straight to the government coffers\nDoes is in essence become an indirect tax for the people the U.S thanks for taking my question\nYeah Mick the terrorists are getting a lot of attention and rightfully so and yes you are you are correct a tariff is essentially attacks\nIt's attacks targeted on a foreign company that is selling goods and services in the U.S\nAnd it's a way for the government to tell American consumers don't buy that foreign product instead by a domestically manufactured or provided product or service and stuff so yeah terrorists are essentially taxes and the money essentially does go into government coffers I'm\nReally that simple foreign governments retaliate by doing the same thing you know when one government you know throws a punch the other governments throw equal punches and are there you are so yes the terrorists um make products and services more expensive\nAnd the money goes into the government and taxes which is good news right we've got a massive deficit right the government is spending more money than it's receiving this helps to solve that problem but uh the burden is paid by American consumers\nWho a foot the bill so yeah that's what the terrorists are terrified his synonym for tax\nRevenue generation protocol right I mean they come up with all kinds of ever noticed that you no longer right your taxes at the end of the year to the IRS they want you to write your check to the United states treasury because nobody wants to

financial services L L [noise]\n\n\nYou're listening to the Rick Adelman show we talk a lot here on the program about the coming Social Security crisis and the importance that we get Congress to take action now to help us further this conversation I'm very excited to bring on the program militiamen now she's the Peter up truck or professor of management sciences at Boston college's Carol school of management\nAnd more to my heart she's the director of the Boston College Center for Retirement Research that might not sound like a big deal you but in our circles and the financial planning world\nThe Boston College Center for Retirement Research produces some of the most important data a useful in the financial planning world so leash I'm really excited to have you with us on the program today\nOh I'm delighted endorsement\nAlicia is a a former member of the president's council of economic advisor she was former assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy um so how is the retirement outlook these days for today's workers\nIt it's not the we calculated in in ... shows about fifty percent of today's working how falls are not going to be able to maintain their standard of living once I stop working\nWell that's not very exciting and ... is the situation been this way for a long time or has the landscape changed in recent decades\nUm the landscape has changed a lot in recent decades has gotten a ... a or since the financial crisis\nMean two cents to those me\nWhy what we should ask why what lost a lot of money in two thousand eight and a lot of house values and those items haven't totally returned\nWell wait a minute hang on I mean if you sat through two thousand eight and took no action I mean the stock market back then was at fourteen thousand before the crisis\nUh today the Dow is pushing twenty five thousand housing prices back you know seven weren't as high as they are today in major markets so shouldn't people actually be better off today now that we've had an extra ten years of savings on top of it\nAnd yet you're saying that's not really true in a lot of cases\nSo shocking to the stock market the people who hold stocks or the people in the high end conference so if you look at the top third and yes they have equity holdings and they have um their stock values have gained in\nTheir stocks have gained Italian um but for the bottom two thirds of households ... really don't hold very much in stocks and I think the housing a story is yes for almost back to where it was our two thousand sixteen and hadn't quite gotten back to the peak\nOf the bubble up by two thousand sixteen but the house values are really high on the ... as you know in Boston New York and California and and not so high in between and not even in all parts of California\nAnd this is I think the point that a lot of folks really don't fully comprehend them and we see this every day in our financial planning practice that\nAlthough it's true that people who own stocks and oh seven had they held through today they'd be a lot better off the first fact as you pointed out as most people did known stocks that all second those many of those who did hold stocks and those seven panicked nine sold at the low or near it and so they're kind of frozen\nIn time there are ... are pretty much were they were even though we're ten years later they enjoy the run up in value because they didn't hold onto their investment for having continue to add to their investments and so they are still stuck where they were ten years ago\nThat that's right and it's and it's a lot of people lost their jobs between a two thousand seven in\nTwo thousand nine and had to turn to their four one K. and other retirement holdings to make ends meet during that period\nSo even if I hadn't ... events just demanded that 'cause they withdraw their money well on marriage issues medical issues other family issues they just didn't have the luxury of holding on to their investments [noise]\nSo that means people are now in a conundrum because here we are ten years later everyone's ten years older retirement is ten years closer\nAnd they might not have the retirement savings account values today that they had hoped they would have by now that's forcing people to work longer but is that as viable or an answer as you might hope\nSo I'm a great fan of people working longer I think it's the most powerful lever Pete that people can control and it has a huge impact on their wellbeing a in retirement\nSo we've got the issue that people in order to improve their situation and generate income for themselves that they won't outlive is one key working longer the longer you work\nThe more money you're adding to your investments to more but those investments can grow in value and let's face it the longer you work the shorter your retirement will be and that means less money also when we need to accumulate so it was a double benefit or by working longer\nIf you take your Social Security benefits Seventy and set of sixty two it's Seventy six percent higher and so your lifetime benefits will be the same but your monthly benefit will be um that Seventy six additional present\nSo work longer so that you are saving more your investments can grow more value your ultimately going to get a higher monthly Social Security benefits and all that money isn't going to have the last as long as it otherwise myself\nExactly right but loses only one other us up is less than a lot of people I think ignore and that's the equity in their homes is that a potential resource for oh I'm\nJust I I Love the house almost as much as I Love working longer um you're right for\nMany people their houses their largest asset outside of the\nWealth that they have them in their Social Security benefits and a tapping home equity I think is actually going to be part of the answer and going forward or the difficulty here is the mechanism is they're\nThey're basically three ways to do it one you can sell your house and go buy a cheaper house\nAnd it has to be a cheaper house not smaller house because a lot of people sell their house in the ... suburbs moved to the city and the costs just as much if not more right and so it has to be a cheaper house that's one way to go the other is a reverse mortgage but there are so complicated to many people you need to have", "show_name": "The Ric Edelman Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "14"}
