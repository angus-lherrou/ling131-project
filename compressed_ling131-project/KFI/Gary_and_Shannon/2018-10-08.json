{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "Miss the county performances [laughter]\n\nAnd I we're all\nWatch that too muddy continually tonight at ... pm on KTLA five\nNever give away free to matter how tiny by abducted every every time we have two to six [noise]\n\nAnd this is a campfire handle here as we end the show don't forget a writer south of the hour to five and the between the five and twenty a we are we give away a thousand dollars there I finally got the timing correct so Robin go stuffing okay All right\nNow let's go back and finished shop handle on how do they have a case\nWhy do we do with strippers what a\nWhat do you think we do is rent for a while I couldn't really wrestled with how to handle the stripping problem you know there's rules about like if the strip club serves alcohol than be nude and they're\nAll right so in Louisiana they passed a law and if you're in a a strip club establishment and it serves alcohol that any dancers have to be Twenty one or older yes\nAnd if they're a breast or buttocks are exposed okay okay so three dancers one of them is Eighteen one of them is Nineteen one unlimited money they filed a lawsuit and they said this law is unconstitutional leave egg\nWhy is it unconstitutionally vague\nBecause you can't tell what the phrase breasts or buttocks are exposed really means\nHow much at what point is a buck or two considered to be exposed yeah\nAnd as you know one of the things that's required for any ... constitutional is a person must understand to be very what did it required right so that is their argument and this went all the way up to the Fifth Circuit court of appeals ... what do you think\nOkay first of all as far as the breasts are concerned that he is fairly easy to determine because any part of the nipple for example ah that's exposed or by the Orioles whatever the hell they call it\nA if you can see that then that's considered an exposed brass was why they have bases which by the way our great tasting if I'm Talking about the uh the ... uh no no ... quarterly corners fares these yeah confusing the two yes anyway so uh\nThat's fairly easy the ... part is a little bit more difficult to determine what exposed and exposed bought accuse and on that one I the\nWell [noise] [noise]\nYeah I just you know what I don't know the answer although I\nIt has been argue there are plenty of municipalities out there plenty of states that talk about you can't show breaths if you or you can't show a total nudity if you serve certainly the twenty Twenty one Nineteen year old issue that's that's a given that's not a problem\nSo I'm going to say at first glance it seems [noise]\nI Would think that they would have an argument on the other hand I think it's because ah maybe the are members of the court or all Republicans who have a very hard time or ... maybe it's the other way or I Am going to guess\nAre here we go ah the Baltics issue prevails on behalf of the Baltic women uh that's why I guess yes they went on what basis that\nIt's too vague to simply say or if your breasts or buttocks are exposed that's not clear enough as to how much do you have to be wearing before you are violating the static continue ever determine what that means we'll probably not and so they're going to have to figure out a way to ... rewrite\nThe law because you can imagine from a practical standpoint I'm In one county the sheriff decides if that much is showing your in violation but in another county that sheriff's decide roe only going to arrest people if that much is showing right you can have it\nOkay they wanted to do the last one really ... terms were coming into the voting laws North Dakota\nDoesn't have a voter registration requirement\nYou can just show up on election day and cast a ballot without ever having done anything in advance well they passed a law and basically it has to do with this you have to show ID and the id has to show your name your date of birth and your residential street address\nWell there are a bunch of Native Americans who sued and said you know a lot of Native American communities they don't really have traditional residential street addresses\nSo how are we going to vote under this requirement what we want you to do is change it and say we have to show residents will address or a mailing address and the state said no no no\nNo no we don't have to do that and this went up to the federal appeals court what do you think they said about this record\nOn I think the Indians would win on that uh because I it was that there has to be a substantial\nReasonable a way of having an address made\nOr an address given a on a reservation for example wherever they live and to say you need a resident to address when they don't have one because of where they live it becomes impossible for them to vote I'm saying that that was that requirement is an undue burden\nUpon the Indians have standing to sue and they will get their uh\nIn court so I was right on that one yeah okay that's a shocker a so I was wrong on one where I should have been right ah but ah the rest of it is yeah All right Jerry howdy howdy what's going on in your\nWorld oil we're going to have the latest on the the cabinet confirmation today is a holiday so he doesn't have to go to work today but they are going to do a party for him at the White House tonight and an interesting look at what Dr Christine Ford\nWants now did you say anything did you see the Saturday Night live skit ... okay it's very funny to see that it's the Republicans who are are celebrating it is hilarious um it's a party\nWill talk about that limo crashes well into yeah we just found out that ... the ... that was involved failed state inspection last month\nSo it'd be I mean the the number I thought when I saw that alert yesterday I thought it was wrong\nHappy about could you could you lose Eighteen twenty people in one crash I bought it in one car right\nWell to pedestrians I think but I go to Italy and crazy amount of people it's a lot of ... and then the John Cox Gavin Newsom conversation do call it a debate the conversation is taking place in just a few minutes we're going to keep an eye on Iran that end up bringing hiring highlights if there is such a thing the throughout the show\nAnd don't forget that are between the five and a twenty after every hour throughout the day or we're giving away a thousand dollars in the meantime uh Gary Europe with Shannon are you able to joke user and this is a KFI am six forty\nOkay bass with Angela in orange county already\nUm vets or that I Would have man I Would love to fly on the wall for that whole thing\nWell this may be the last day that we say the name Brett Kavanaugh for a while after a couple of weeks of saying Brett Kavanaugh more than we've said Gary and Shannon\n[laughter] Brett Kavanaugh finally confirmed on Saturday fifty to forty eight vote he was sworn in immediately\nAs the one hundred and fourteen ths associate justice of the Supreme Court they're going to do a ceremonial I think they're a ceremonial thing tonight is planned at the White House in the East Room sort of a celebration happened and then in four o'clock hour or o'clock hour time because the president right now is in Florida\nThe um the actual job I mean he gets voted for the robe and sits in the chair tomorrow in starts hearing arguments before the court\nAre there different robes sizes or is it a one size fits all situation\nThere's a there's a robe mhm or if you're Ruth Bader Ginsburg Lena Kagan her Sonia Sotomayor you have the Dickey that the uh the tattered ... thank you Dickey is a little bit more masculine the joy leave that hangs out over your robe and then the chief justice I think is the one who has the stripes\nOn is how do you get your specific robe I mean is it like scribes where you go to like um you know there are services that they do different designs of Scrabble you know ...\nOr a question you know I'm gonna I I was like on that yet Nick you need to figure out who makes what goes on with the roads roles and already judge for that matter is it the same people\nThat make the uh the robes for the for the pope\nOr they or they or the quality of your high school graduation again this is we need to know all about Austin's does it [laughter]\nMaybe a class rings oh they throw in a cloud yeah they do they do justice robes also I think a couple of interesting things that I saw about all of this is that people are more outraged and feel better about their outrage than I've ever seen\nIn my lifetime and they are saying uh that fat outrage is what they're acting as if that outrageous what makes them a good person\nAnd if you could be more outraged about this confirmation to the Supreme Court then somehow you're morally superior to people who are not outraged by this\nI Would suggest we played almost the entire Susan Collins speech on friday because we were she was the one who was sort of um she she was the one who was going to be the deciding vote at least at that point\nAnd her speech\nYou may disagree with her conclusion to vote in favor of Brett Kavanaugh but her speech was one of the most thoughtful well put together reasoned speeches on the entire subject of Brett Kavanaugh that we had ever heard\nAnd in fact rose to the level of one of the greatest speeches that we've heard on the Senate floor again you don't have to agree with her that doesn't matter your feelings may have even been hurt\nBy the fact that she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh but it was a brilliant speech and her job she showed that what she was tasked with as a senator was to advise and consent and that's exactly what she did and she laid it out and a forty five minutes speech judicial\nShop dot com\nApparently is a big supplier of judges robes and ... they ranging in price from Seventy five dollars to five hundred\nDollar who you want to get the five hundred

I think two and a half year old or something I'm\nIt's just terrible and in the the the tragedy about this crash\nIs it was absolutely preventable the driver wasn't properly licensed the limo should have not been on the road it failed and inspection last month that looks like these kids had hired a bus to take them around I think that we're going to a breweries and stuff and they'd done the responsible thing right they hire the bus so that they're not driving the bus broke down\nAnd so I guess the company sent this broken down limo and before the crash one of the girls in the limo taxed at her friend and said this limos and really bad condition\nWe found out the New York times posted a story just before we went on the air that said that this limos specifically this car failed a state safety inspections last month I don't know for parents had been made since then but we do know that it was in bad condition\nThe driver is it fifty three year old guy named Scott ... ah listen if she or\nHe was killed alongside the Seventeen relatives friends and neighbors and among those Seventeen who are in the back of the limo workforce sisters Allison Abby Mary Ann Amy held it was a nice birthday they were celebrating\nI Can't ... you can't imagine what that is the other thing is I assumed that just I assumed limousine you automatically think that something's going on at night she was two o'clock in the afternoon\nIn the town of a show ... in a trailer you say it right about two o'clock on Saturday or about a hundred and\nSeventy miles outside of New York city north a kind of near Albany and this limo was on state route thirty it goes through the intersection blows a stop sign and strikes a parked Toyota Highlander now this intersection this site\nIs notorious for accidents people have been talking about this intersection for\nYears one of the women who lived there just get Kirby she's actually the director of that county store where this\nTrump told reporters earlier at the White House he's not intend to fire Rosenstein following those reports that he talked about secretly recording Trump and exposing the chaos that is the Trump Administration\nChaos chaos\nOr did you see the rocket last night or did you see the pictures of it\nI saw the picture you posted that looked like my mom my mom's picture and uh then I saw the picture that Eric Leonard took which was a professional photo\nYes it looked very good um but that rocket last night it was actually carrying an earth observation satellite took off from Vandenberg people as far away as Phoenix remember my goal my goal and used to work here learn Arizona He posted a picture of it and said it was one of the most amazing things he's ever seen\nAnd it was the first time that he's space X rocket landed the first stage booster back at the launch site back where it landed was about a quarter mile away from where it took off at Vandenberg amazing it is incredible\nIncredible hey guess what coming up in the ... and the next hour is going to be your chance\nThe dollar how this is a good idea\nWell yeah a thousand dollars is always a good idea how much right when at the casino over the weekend\nA hundred bucks that's good which is great when you consider it was blackjack and uh nobody wins that that I timed it perfectly I had a couple of good in fact I had to blackjack within about three hand nice\nAnd said okay [noise]\nAnd I'm done thank you show last year and it's to the tide rules in and then the tide rolls out I just don't like\nHow everything's got to be a super side but now the the table I was playing on you can bet on whether or not the dealer with Boston how many cards with Boston oh that's that's what we know we there was a one dollar bet and if he busted and on three cards you pay you wonder one who ... who was two to one well one time\nThe guy at the end of the table throws a five dollar bet down on that special mark\nAnd the the dealer busted with seven cards choosing that SARS and then a seven and he was paid fifty to one the guy went to ... locks on that\nAnd the and and not ... and that happens a once a day you know and and now there are times you're just saying goodbye to that side but I like to pair square you know and they pay you for a for a for a pair right happens kind of regular\nI'm One of the stories that we talked about yesterday as sorry last week was the president's conversation in the White House Rose Garden ... remember I was a conversation about the economy was a news conference about the economy\nAnd specifically to use the ... the whatever the the new trade agreement was and Caitlin Collins a reporter for CNN stood in the back and was trying to repeatedly asked questions about judge Kavanaugh and he was shouting her down no no we're not going to talk about that yet we're going to talk about the economy we're talking about trade\nAnd finally she asked her question and he gave her one question zero follow up\nDrank a lot and so I don't know whether it'd be big discrepancy okay yes go ahead please can you probably you know what you really ... you've had enough hey hey\nWell killing Collins\nSeventy years ago wrote some things on Twitter that are getting her in\nTrouble so she's twenty six now now she is yeah and these tweets are from her days as a college student at the University of Alabama\nRoll type one of them uses the word uh for a cigarette and the other says I don't know if I Want to room with a lesbian\nOkay what okay\nThe court and by the way this is the log cabin Republicans the largest Republican organization dedicated representing LGBT conservatives and its allies um the way Caitlin defended this there I don't know if defended it was the right word but the way she explained it was when I was in college\nI use ignorant language and a few tweets to my friends it was immature but it doesn't represent the way I feel at all I regret it\nAnd apologize and so the ... the Internet response so people can change is that what we're saying and the thing\nIs is the sweet irony is that she was the one pressing him on cabin on what cabin on may have done when he was in high school\nOr ... ... a ... a reply to that\nOn Twitter so what you're saying is we shouldn't judge someone no pun intended by the way they acted in college or say high school [laughter]\nGot ya doing I'm merit\nWrote and don't worry under the precedent set with justice Kavanaugh we'll only hold this useful in youthful indiscretion against you for the next thirty five years or so and whether it's a micro whether it was ten years ago or thirty five your side said it mattered\nWell and you know what's funny is it exposes Twitter and how it used to be a handful of years ago when people young people were using it almost as a form of text messaging\nEach other like she was just talking to our friends on Twitter you know back when you didn't realize what Twitter was going to become right you just thought it was this cute little messaging app\nYeah but even then I\nFeel like the beginning of social media when when people started signing up for Facebook there was there were plenty of voices that said listen just so you know\nEverything that you had on your my space page and are now transferring over to our Facebook page it's still available and it will never ever go away completely she'll be careful what you do and I just I guess at the age of Nineteen you didn't you didn't get to hear that\nUm but I think this is a great lovely piece of irony for people who say that CNN is so skewed for one of their own reporters to uh to be caught in something like this and again I don't I don't care what you said when she was Nineteen I don't care we all said stupid things and did stupid things were Nineteen years old\nAnd I just didn't do it on social me I think how many times that we said this guy so thankful so thankful that our lives we're not documented on social media to Jesus\nAnd Al Gore for delaying your invention [laughter]\nI don't think anyone has ever think those two people at the same time I just\nHad that same thought I think that was the first time that's ever happened\nI was like no one has ever taken a plane ride from Cleveland to\nLondon and the history of you [laughter]\nThere is no such thing as a direct flight we've linked\nTry ongoing to conquer a lot of firsts can be a good

happening but you're running for the governor of the state of California\nWhat about ... you know ... ...\nYou know uh I I regret to all the division is in politics today or if I have been going to say about it I'm going to try to get reforms that reduced the division\nI was going to have anything to say about it has to do with fund raising\nIn California there is no defensiveness we're we're all we're all in with feelings\nSo much so that the governor's debate is a Congress they've called the Congress they're not going to have anything to say with how the country is divided right now\nA uses their position of power and authority to impose themselves on an under a someone who is subordinate to them or you know should be searched and uh you know should be removed from office frankly\nI

reproduction\nHighlights drinking California ... will always be available\nYou say you care about the issues of California is very relevant and Kevin\nBecause you have a profound impact on California California on their reproductive rights which you do not believe a woman as a right to choose regardless whether or not the rape\nOr or had tragic and sort of incest or Kevin uh will play an outsized role in that you've been an advocate for the repeal of the Affordable CARE Act which would have cost and the Graham Cassidy bill one hundred and thirty eight point eight billion dollars by twenty twenty\nSeven in the state of California and that also eliminated funding for Planned Parenthood a and that will impact reproductive rights to access a for millions and millions\nIt's almost as if you have a new some doesn't know who California is he talking about these things that are never going to change in the state of California abortion is that is one of those cases are one of those issues in California that's never going\nYeah but you have to get people afraid you have to get people or\nYou have to in fear you have to whip up their feeling is that right that's exact so let's continue to legislate based on our feelings and one day and he says will absolutely collapse\nIs one thing it Gavin Newsom says well first of all it's completely irrelevant question for somebody who's running for governor in California but if you're going to ask it Gavin Newsom can say something to the effect of\nWorld K in California will always make sure that women have a right to choose\nBut think about other parts of the country that are not as well off as California women who are very poor and they are in states that Kavanaugh's decision on roe v Wade\nMay affect them if they ... if they limit the scope of roe v Wade or are they they they cut it down a little bit uh what about the woman in Alabama that won't have access and she doesn't have the money to come to California\nYou know what I mean there's a way to address the issue with outlined people right\nAnd there's a way to make it about what California can't what the governor of California can do a John Cox not to belittle the issue of abortion but could have said something like I Want to\nMake sure that if you are\nGoing to your gay pride parade or you were driving to your unemployment line or you are driving to the DMV that you get there safely\nWe need to concentrate on the infrastructure of this state to make sure\nThat we continue to thrive economically because if we don't we will quickly become a third world country where rights and privileges that we currently enjoy will be stripped away from us because we simply physically cannot get to those places where we want to do those things\nBoston last question that debate which one of the represents the mainstream of California bedrooms cars I think I'd do it because I represent the people who are just trying to get by I wasn't\nPutting office by billionaires I'd you know I I had to work my way up I had to overcome all go all the way through and and that's something that I think the people who stood with ... with\nFifteen seconds [laughter] so I certainly think we represent the vast majority of California's reject John Cox is an absolute allegiance to Trump and Trump ism a and his longstanding advocacy for causes that I don't think the vast majority of Californians embrace well\nAt least in trying to lay the poor card again because Gavin Newsom growing up and marine county which is like the richest are the top three richest counties in the country does not go over well him talking about how you know it is it his mom had to work a couple of jobs to support them in England\nA toy when he clean the toilet building where fiber and you wouldn't have such an issue I\nI I don't get it like you cannot do you went to Santa Clara huge money that is so yeah if you were that poor he would have lived in Murray and you would have lived in another place ... him when he every tries to sell that I grew up a poor child in marine county it just never works out\nWhere people don't have hair like that there's that too are exactly right this is something that um I Would suggest that or if you're going to vote [laughter] and you should let you go through and listen to this whole debate because from what I gather\nIs wait hold on yeah I mean the only

people know limo including four sisters they're all in their way to a birthday party [noise] one of the uh [noise]\nOne of the things that's been floating around the outskirts of this governor's race between John Cox and Gavin Newsom is that ah even Gavin Newsom is now suggesting that San Francisco is getting a little game me [noise] oh really yeah even he knows the things are getting a little too permissive when it comes to you know death\nVacation on the streets of said oh that's good what's his plans um oh nothing are we going to go back to punishing people for cropping on the street or now you know because we can't do we can't hurt their feelings I'm One of the other things in San Francisco\nIs that the sheriff's department there is going to let an inmate decide whether they want to be released at night or in the morning\nBecause we want to ensure inmate safety by the end of this month county jail inmates in San Francisco will be able to waive their rights to release for up to sixteen hours or until normal business hours under this new policy\nSo we can't keep them in at all because our prisons are overcrowded jails are overcrowded but we're going to allow them to stay in

it was a first chargers game that I tend to\nWhere it was not in question the entire game that they were going to win and it was a nice little Sunday it was ever has no stress everyone was having a great time after I mean it was still a little bit stressful and it was\nVery silent on the sidelines before the game they were very intense they knew this was like it was not mess around here um and and a couple of drives that they had to settle for for a field goal on a it was a little bit of upset meant but then after the first score\nOf the first ... ... everyone was just having a blast it was just like little kids playing football and by the way you\nSaid the word dang Camus is that was that the word that fill the rivers was use yes new word thing gamut\nYes it's not a bad word it's not a bad word he uses words that are not curse words\nBut sound like they should be yeah you know what he's you know what he means though right [noise] yeah\nUh the top of the hour we're going to get into all of our what's trending stories we also have an opportunity by the way for you to win a thousand dollars will tell you how you can do that between twelve o five and twelve twenty\nAnd um we're doing this story about ... there are there are concerns about funding all showing up and all these different street drugs now specifically cocaine heroin methamphetamine that will potentially put\nPolice officers' lives at risk not just the users of the drugs obviously\nBut the police officers who were intercepting these drugs or you know stopping people who have these drugs on them and then testing these drugs sometimes out on the street they could potentially expose themselves to feed all levels of drugs with just simple\nYou know procedures that they've done for decades now testing for drugs\nYeah they're using scanners and now a devices that are about the size of unintended game boy\nDo they still have those\nYes some people do I\nOkay and it can examine\nA white powder and we'll tell an officer what's in it or whether it's methamphetamine met no whatever they don't have to they don't have to open up a package of white powder\nYeah the the scanner looks through glass or plastic or whatever it in to tell the officer what it's made of\nAccidental exposure is what they're trying to avoid it can be a two milligram dose that could kill you offend no\nThere was a uh the da ... videos to law enforcement agencies around the country\nDescribing the experience of a couple of officers from New Jersey they were accidentally exposed to fend when some of it is if you watch the video they say it moved into the year when it pushed into the air as one of the officers were done a field test just tried to seal the bag back up\nAnd this powdered substance goofed into the air they breathe it in they determined later that it was a mix of heroin cocaine and fentanyl\nThey're going for the devil's triangle there they experienced dizziness shortness of breath and respiratory\nProblem and let's just the stuff\nWe're not going to put devil's triangle and to the lexicon of the program and we're not going to put ... into the program as well I Will allow beer but not devil's triangle or boosting right well\nJust I'm just trying to make it clear for people so inside the bag heroin cocaine and fentanyl so they have the triple play\nThat acceptable triple play sure they have the triple play of drugs and both of them start experiencing ridiculously high um heartbeat respiratory problems shortness of breath dizziness and one of the officers even says I thought I was going to die\nAnd the DEA urged any law enforcement officers who come in contact with spending or federal compound to take them directly to a lab and get yourself to a hospital\nCan you imagine that feeling when ... the symptoms start to take effect\nAnd you don't know how long you have to get to a facility and you know you could be on your way out right there right there you know you get on the phone I that's just terrifying\nWell among other things that we talked about that little handheld device that can scandals are not cheap either about twenty two grand a pop yeah so you're going to find very few of them available some of the law enforcement agencies have one per agency or maybe\nTo the other things that they've been doing is instructing officers in some cases to not feel to test these drugs if you have a suspicion bring it back to the station house because in the station house what they're doing is using glove boxes imagine\nA month trying to think oh like a a premature baby\nRight that's in an incubator and the nurses can only treat the child by putting their hands through those gloves because they can't handle the physical contact because the potential for a for cross contamination whatever it is that's basically what you would do is you'd put whatever substance you have in the glove box\nUse those so that you are protected against anything if it should poof out I said poof\nA but those are all different ways that they're doing it to try to protect law enforcement officers from a potential sentinel exposure in the event that some of these people are out there mixing funding or what their heroin because I guess that's the way that we're doing is now\nComing up next we have a catch up for you will catch you up on everything everyone is
