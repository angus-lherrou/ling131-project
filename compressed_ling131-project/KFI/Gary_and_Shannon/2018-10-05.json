{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "Do miss the iconic performances young [laughter]\n\nTo watch the comedy this Sunday and Monday Night that they only KTLA five every catalog model for pay phones here I was and what I did a little runway model when I was just a part time national we make to fix on camp\n\n[noise]\n\nFinancial here on a [noise] a what a day on friday where the Senate or just voted\nTo actually morning flowers go to move the Brett Kavanaugh boat this weekend to confirm it's a done deal so break Kavanaugh will be the next associate Supreme Court justice All right we're going to finish the show with a a kind of a wild story a paid period leave policy in Australia [noise]\nAnd that's storing a starting a huge debate around the world because we're talking about women uh who of course uh do I say suffered their periods I guess a for a lot of women is that fair to say and uh there's a lot of pain\nEvery month and so ah there is an advocacy group in Australia that in fact is pushing for and ah it's the trust officers in Australia who are now giving paid leave and they're looking at public policy here\nAnd the possibility of national paid leave for painful periods a period lead menstrual leave\nThis doesn't count as sick leave this is on top of sick leave\nAnd a woman has will have the right under a proposed law and looks like it's going that way\nTo stay home to having the uncomfortable uncomfortable symptoms but a lot of women can be an enormous pain and uh I once had a girlfriend early days and she was a for three days issues out now disabled\nI mean could not move couldn't get out of bed and\nWould are simply not be able to go to work I mean it it can be that bad and of course it can be a were women it's no big deal so there was research that was done prior to this policy\nAnd involved an online survey more than three thousand women and twenty two in person discussion groups and it's gonna be released a in the next six months but it looks like\nA it's a going to prove that there really is a major issue in terms of just the physical health of women during that period so to speak\nNow this gets really interesting because now it flies in the face of the argument that women\nAre aren't treated the same uh that they there's an inequality gap requires that quality gap a pay gap women can't be counted on as much as men and if you add to that argument\nOkay so all things being equal would you rather hire a man or a woman who takes two or three days off every month on TALK of on top of sick leave or obviously there is a some discussion to be had there now\nAre there are minstrel leave programs policies now I didn't know this in Indonesia in Japan in Vietnam South Korea Taiwan and\nChina\nAh since Nineteen forty seven women in Japan have been granted Mr leave right after World War two South Korea female workers are since two thousand one Seventeen years ago are entitled to one day off each month\nNow you're talking in South Korea do a it's a female workers in male dominated workplaces or they don't do much of that I mean it's just not something you'd take advantage of for example is same resume reasons I said\nBecause automatically a woman takes several days off you're going to be All right come on really\nNow I have all women employees at a center of surrogate parenting I'm the only male there and we already give if any of our staff becomes pregnant [noise] obviously we're big fans of uh\nMaternity leave to say the least uh and I don't know how I Would feel I Know my partner Karen would go crazy Karen is out of or mine would equality me even to the point where ah someone has to stay home and take care of the kids because we have a kid is sick uh caring ago how about your husband\nWhat you call him and ask him to stay home why is that you have to stay home I mean those are the questions are that are out so uh\nAnd I'm On a minstrel leave how do you feel about that right away Shannon uh allowing women\nTo I take a period leaves at every month to deal with a dealing with Mr cycle\n[noise] [noise] I don't know okay excellent\nWell fed and great analysis you thank you by the way that is one of the issues of are voting for woman president a GOP Freeman stroll\nOut or dream was like oh he's every twenty eight days the possibility of a nuclear war a post menopausal or during the ... or the hot flashes there goes if I'm On the button\nYou sound like such a jackass thank you [laughter] so tell me\nGoing on and we'll keep our eye on Senator Susan\nCollins announcement yes she voted to send this nominee on through to the final vote\nBut it has happened in the past where people have voted to advance a nominee and then ultimately voted against the confirmation so we will keep an eye on the vote tally for Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court also it's like the war of Granada downtown LA from fourteen Ninety\nOh we have a outbreak of type is going on so isn't that lovely will get into the details there also doubling has a plan to put all of its homeless people on a cruise ship sounds kind of nice study\nWhat that's a nice way to do that it's almost worth being homeless\nI agree a nice little vacation all out on the water you know looking at the sunsets and the and what would the entertainment to be\nA yeah it doesn't matter there on a cruise ship and how\nQuickly would type is blow through that thing or nor nor a noble thought it would be a a cornucopia of disease\nNow my guess maybe it's not a cruise ship the way we know cruise ships or maybe it's like one of\nThe uh [noise] I ... a like a commercial yeah or a prisoner ship during ... during the civil war okay could be could be\nAll right so that's all coming up you get a lot going on to yes are alright on a friday a Syrian Shannon coming up tomorrow morning six or seven o'clock handle on the wall marginal legal advice do ah five on ours tomorrow I don't know if anybody actually tuned in for five hours\nI listen to it if I'm driving out to Vegas I'll listen to it for four hours\nYeah Blake just raise his hand he listens to it like this because he works right he's on the board so he has no choice or I should and you have a good show thank you handle in the morning team are back on Monday KFI am six forty\nOkay Beth Hi Angela in orange county and I already\nMoving on I mean he can't live from the KFI twenty four hour newsroom the U.S Senate has voted to advance the Supreme Court nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh devote limits debate time so final confirmation vote can be held this weekend majority leader Mitch McConnell told senators the initial vote makes a statement whether the ...\nOf partisan politics got override the presumption of innocence or will reaffirmed it in the United states of America every one is a girl proven filtered\n[noise]\nAh what do you think Susan Collins is going to do no idea and it's weird because I again I mean it's weird because she voted obviously in favor today this uh this procedural vote today which puts a time limit on the debate and forces to a confirmation vote either tomorrow early Sunday\nAnd but which clearly not\nTipping your hand one way or the other\nRight ... ... and ... and does it affect the way that Republican senators start crawling votes if she comes out votes to send him forward ... is there as much of an urgency with Republican senators today right now in those closed door meetings\nAs there would be if she voted no like Republicans right now being like All right we got it we got it we're fine we've got the votes and they're not hustling\nLosing as just being foods and\nRight and then she comes out at noon hour time whereas I'm not voting this guy through\nAnd there's a little bit of a panic well\nSo we found out yesterday Heidi Heitkamp the Democratic senator from very Republican North Dakota is there no we figured that out um it looks like Senator Murkowski isn't no cause she says that even though he is a bright Cavanaugh is a good man\nI'm we're also at a place where we need to think about the credibility of our institutions suggesting that\nHe is not the right man for the court at this time so there's two nose and then you've got Collins\nAnd mansion and I'm ... and what am I missing their high camping Murkowski cones mention\nFlake kind of like Jeff Flake has already said that he's gonna he's not he's not a question anymore no not anymore I'm now complicating matters for Republicans is a guy by the name is Steve Gaines [laughter]\nI Love this story Steve Gaines as a senator Republican out of Montana everybody know Steve Gaines no\nOh but if you're in Montana you probably do but not us\nBut it's unusual listen we talk about we talk about political stuff a lot I mean we do an entire half hour of the show every day dedicated to nothing but politics I've never heard the name ... before the ...\nMe neither me neither I says senator Steve Gaines announced that he is not going to be at the vote on Saturday because he's walking his daughter down the aisle at her wedding now his vote will not be needed unless one Republican defects id Susan Collins\nYeah so it's it's a weird thing he's already said like you said he's already I'm In he's like I'm I'm absolutely voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nBut I'm not doing it on Saturday\nHe's going to be home in Montana walk and his daughter down the aisle for her wedding but you can bet that every senator well at least every Republican senator is saying hey I I Know a guy who's got a plane who immediately after the I do's will pick you up yeah ally you back to D.C\nSo that you can push the button or at least to the vocal or are for\nFor confirmation this would be a crowning achievement for Mitch McConnell if this goes through um he was able to block that democratic nominee to the court for more than a year he has been able to muscle dozens of appeals and district court nominees through\nThe Senate it would just be such a coup for him um now the\nAmerican Bar association this is mildly interesting\nWhich had issued a unanimous well qualified rating for Kavanaugh\nSays in a letter today that it's going to reopen its evaluation because of new information of material nature regarding temperament and that's all about the emotional and combative hearing last week you know I talked about it yesterday that's what bothered me almost more than anything\nWas the way that he behaved like a like a ... child well he addressed that I don't know if\nYou saw this op ed ... did in the wall Street Journal yeah um it's\n... I don't know if it's the last best argument but it's clearly a last argument in terms of him I'm making his case as to why he should be confirmed and\nThe way he put it I I thought was well done and I I had the conversation I don't know if you talk to your husband about this I've talked to my wife about this it seems like every single day for the last two weeks\nAnd he refers in this op ed piece you know the first few paragraphs are all about how I Will be an independent impartial judge or a judge must be an umpire a neutral impartial arbiter who favors no political party litigation or policy\nHe says I Do not decide cases based on personal our policy preferences I'm not a pro plane to for pro defendant judge I'm not a pro prosecution or pro defense judge I Am a pro law judge\nAbout how he would model his own um\nAnd has modeled his own judge ship and his career as a judge\nAfter that Justice Kennedy a judge must be independent not swayed by public pressure are independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic but to get what you were talking about he did issue a an explanation perhaps as to why he was so emotional but we have a thousand dollars to give away so why don't we do\nThat for your sided one thousand dollars and now that can work to two hundred two hundred you'll get a tax confirming every plus I really only folks that are dead and listening to apply that\nTo two hundred two hundred\nMember you have to answer the phone got\nAnd even if it's from a number that you don't recognize because they recognize that you don't answer that you don't pick it up they're gonna move onto the next person and that thousand dollars flies out your window or would you don't want that they don't want that money to sprout wings missed call I didn't even know that number your next chance to win is next hour around this time you've got a chance to win a thousand\nDollars once an hour Monday through friday right here on KFI from five AM\nTo six twenty pm he he talks in the op ed about how the confirmation process played out how he met with sixty five senators explained his approach to the law that he participated in more than thirty hours of hearings before the committee\nHe submitted written answers to nearly Thirteen hundred additional questions and then as I was grateful for the opportunity\nThen goes on to say after all of that are essentially I was subjected to run full and sometimes vicious allegations my time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters have faced by ... and violent threats\nHe says last Thursday he wanted to defend his family and his good name and his lifetime of public service saying my hearing testimony was forceful and passionate\nThis because I Am forcefully and passionately deny the allegations against me\nOr he did say\nI might have been too emotional at times I Know that my tone was sharp I said a few things I should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there as a sun husband and dad I testified with five people for most in my mind my mom my dad my wife and most of all my daughter's by the way\nHis mom his dad and his wife were in the room Thursday when he was testifying\nI'm so here is here is the way I posed this question to my wife\nLast night someone comes out of my past twenty five thirty years ago and says I did something like this\nAnd I look my wife and he I and I say this is absolutely not true I did not do this\nAnd I said what would you how would you want me to handle this not that I'm ever going to be testified are called to testify before the Senate Judiciary committee but in a public environment like that do I take the high road\nAnd say I\nOne hundred percent denied these accusations it wasn't me I don't know what's going on feel bad for whatever happened\nBut it clearly wasn't me or do I push back and fight and say this has pissed me off it has terrified me it is absolutely destroyed my relationships with other women with women in my family it\nHas taken away things that I have loved dearly for example I mean he talked in the confirmation hearing about he'll never be able to coach basketball again I'm\n... and and with emotion and with absolute frustration show that this is not who I Am this is not what I ... you know what makes me me\nAnd her response was that she I had better do that like I had better come out fighting\nFirst of all because it's not necessarily my personality I Would try to I Try to sound smarter and try to make it you know a non emotional thing well Roger Klee zero sense that I Would be in such a position would you on TALK like that probably I probably put on that aspect\nGuy but like the wigs that\nDon't show up and your accent [laughter] but\nThe emotional part of it I mean he did apologize for it in this op ed piece he apologized to any clover shark\nImmediately after he did that stupid comment where he's already asked her if you ever blacked out senator you ever ... it was it was ridiculous and we said this and we said it a couple of times I understood as emotion but the tone with which he did it in that environment was inappropriate\nThat's who he is you can apologize all day long for your behavior but it doesn't take away your behavior that's who you are but it that's who he is it like it or don't like it think it's appropriate for the court or not but who he was on that third how he acted on that Thursday is absolutely who he is as a person\nIt would be Brett Kavanaugh was only in his early fifties\nYou know and and and and liberals are are are are just as passionate about it\nI mean you want it you want to set a fire to this country and that's our ready heated up to a boiling point you throw in abortion you throw in roe v Wade and people are already on other sides of the room entirely it's a boy girl dance from sixth grade right now\nThanks to twenty sixteen and then the Kavanaugh saying they're moving further closer to their wells and you throw in roe v Wade holy hell but see that and\nI think what's frustrating me about that image I mean the idea that there's so many people on that side with their backs to the wall feeling like they're winning or losing whichever side of the wall you Ron I were on the winning side we're on the losing side\n[noise] those are the people that are getting the attention I mean those people who are making felt most noise but there's a vast and ... I think the majority of people in the country who wake up\nTheir kids off to school go to work work go home watch a baseball game go to bed get up give their kids or kiss him off to school go to work work go home watch a baseball game they don't give a damn\nI think they do I think they have their mind made up about abortion they don't talk about it\nAnd I'm not saying that they haven't made up their mind on the writings but there there there's so many people that are so busy with life right I mean life or if if you're dealing with a a loved one who is sick or you're dealing with good news bad news or your car is broken are those are the things that dominate people's\nMinds and they don't have that they don't have the luxury of worrying about this\nLuxury I mean the luxury of being able to take off a day at work or whatever you did to go protest the Senate Hart office building\nThat's that's a luxury I mean we we we are it's a luxury\nFor us to be able to raise our voices about the politics that we agree with or disagree with out if any credible luxury that we have here\nWhereas other people or you know scraping to get by they don't care\nShould we take bets on what we think Susan Collins is going to do\n[laughter]\nAh I think she's going to enjoy her moment in the sun at noon today\nI usually can I think she is going to vote to confirm and she knows that she's going to have explaining to do as a woman unfortunate as it is yeah and that's what it's going to be about I think but I'm wrong about most lay everything so I mean Patrick homes and he has all games kind of\nKind of woman kind of woman to agree with a or can a woman not side with Dr Christine Blasey Ford in this case\nOr is it because she's a woman she has to\nI think because she's a woman she has explaining to do if she doesn't side and I don't know if it's about siding with doctor for it or not\nUm but you know there there's probably a lot of people who believe Dr Ford that voted him through anyway because of what's at stake yeah\nYou know what I mean it's it's it's like do you believe her as one thing and then do you think it matters is the other thing this was thirty six years ago right is this still the guy who is this still that guy or was he just a teenager drank too much didn't even know what he was doing in that moment\nYou know there's a school of thought to for people and you'll hear this and in some defense attorneys that use the defense of he was drunk he didn't know what he was doing that's not who he is\nYou know what I mean that that defense hasn't really come up\nThough because I think part of it is the the ... ah the\n[laughter] great we've got\nDeal with John and can we fix gamble [laughter]\n\nBabies\nThat Garry Shandling\nA friday\nDean sharp as coming along next hour or even talking about tiles sauce I don't always do that and you know it's got to make ...\n...\nWhat the hell do we do with that when I'm not on my own tile\nThat's when you said about that ... a couple of months ago I Can't make my own I mean\nAnd then he realized boom super\nEasy trail nothing hasn't left your hands since then true\nYes [noise]\nAlso in the one o'clock hour\nOr nine news nuggets you need to know oh they are so good today I hopped gets your barbeque sauce already because these are ... ...\nI'm going to have a I don't have a we have our own way you could have built like he was re on the board like an hour and a half and going to see where it's like oh that's just my boat get off my boat\nDoes Harrison Ford has the captain going and then there were some hang out with a Somali pirate what'd he sounded like he said uh it's okay you go home soon knows the Somali pirates and let 'em hang ... did he say Oh thanks uh-huh okay okay yeah okay okay they said was OK okay\nThere you go go ... go got it\nTurns out in Dublin and its Dublin, Ireland not Dublin, California they are discussing idea of hiring a cruise ship to house the whole bows what could possibly do is go wrong oh bows the homeless people ... about\nThe cost of hiring a two hundred person cruise ship is about\nA half a million dollars [laughter] it has the euro's in town of about ... million dollar half million dollars a week\nEach week\nNow it had been proposed previously before being shelled the because it's a bad idea but they're saying the severity of the housing\nCrisis in do a blood in the city council has agreed to at least look into this there are Thirteen hundred and sixty seven families in homeless accommodations in Dubai in a in a figure they say is going up\nWho would be the ah crude to clean up this this cruise ship from hell\nWell there's there's one thing I think that is different than just saying there's homeless people on a boat because when you say there's homeless people on a boat I sort of conjure up this image of the tent cities\nThat we see every once in a while as you're driving around here just popping up on the deck of a ship and that's not necessarily mean they would at least have their own rooms that they could go in well\nHere's the problem we've got Tyson is in downtown LA right with people living on the streets what it's going to happen when we contain those people in a boat and their poop and\nTogether and everything I mean that's just going to be a cornucopia of disease hoop and together\nSharing bathrooms\nYeah but you are with cruise ships you bring everybody every room has it\nIts own uh you know has its own come mode yeah but homeless\nPeople don't stay within the lines you know they like to\nPoop wherever they please they don't want to just to put in the toilet and their own room I have a feeling that were they want to be free when they're ... you can be a a friday full of poop talk\nJust tear gas anyway that\nThey haven't figured this out for sure but the doubling Irish a Dublin, Ireland city council was looking at it the Irish Government has dedicated sixty million euros recently to housing homeless an emergency accommodations\nOr but this may now have to be spent part of it on renting private ... I Love the who's the ... who's a private cruise ship company\nThat's like oh yeah well they take mine well I\nThink they're just going to take a give give that shipped to the to the city charge 'em a half a million dollars a week and then never put it back into commission like they are you in ... down could never put that thing back into commission\nWhen you think about the ... potential that could go on there I don't know I mean they\nPut them back in commission after they've had legionnaires disease on um\nTrue [laughter] the almighty buck ... head of housing services by the way for the city council is a guy by the name of I bet you can guess it\nBrendan Kenny love that\nI Would do it I Wish I was going to get a mother one royal Caribbean is sending refunds to some passengers effort group reportedly a rowdy conference attendees turned other passengers dream vacation into a nightmare Thirteen hundred employees from an Indian company called ... and\nBoarded the Voyager of the seas

hijacked the cruised by taking over all of the pool deck to the bars the buffets they were parading dancers and women dressed as playboy bunnies around to perform and party on the deck\nIs it just seems like it would happen from time to time on a cruise ship sure\nAnd I don't know uh how many people are I mean it's the Caribbean for crying out loud if you can't dress up like a bunny and have a

know what I Do know lots of teams sharp he's the host of home here on KFI on the weekend\nAnd this is a riot will be something title ... titles are seven inch tile saw that's it\nSeven inch tall so what's the what's the letter here on the on the one side of it is that's a whole pile and plays\nIs with us is that what we call the Scottish just like on a regular table saw you can set it up so you can run several tiles through and give me will be asked same size cuts\nExcellent All right that's what we'll fire that thing up 'cause you're going to show us All right we've already demonstrated that the the style of blade that is just not going to\nCut you it will give you pretty nasty rug rash if you leave your thumb on it yeah you're really stupid whether you're going to get a bad rug burn there I'm sure there are people who have done that no doubt no doubt and we're not encourage all I'm trying to point I'm trying to make today\nIs that uh this is the power tool all power tools need to be respected but there's no reason to shy away if you're thinking about even considering doing your own tire work there's no reason to shy away from ... even if you have zero experience on it because they they just they are they are awesome at cutting through stone\nIn Calais and porcelain and there are terrible at cutting through people [laughter] okay [laughter] or you do if if you work in a world dressed up like Dexter here yeah yeah this would be the worst choice [laughter] saw\n... or just your body or dismantling body All right let's take away if you're going to kill someone don't use the song\nAudits are already ... a lot of water we put on the eyeglasses because some of the ceramic ships while water doesn't help the cutting the water is just to keep the dust down right it would lubricate the blade a little bit but mostly it keeps the dust got attacked if we're to kept the title dry the whole studio would still with ... right\n[laughter] laser [noise] as\nLoud as you can get that little piece of pie all there was what two inches across maybe\nThat's it and at the end up up\nSo the ah besides help when it's on it's not very loud no it's just when it hits the ... just one of his the Nile the latest going to make all the noise out\nThere is like ... yeah it is not like ... your hands in closer OK okay don't worry closer to the ... yeah and push bank I Know she's got a ...\nFoot [laughter] and then\nShe goes he's got her first child you know [laughter]\nAwesome how much force did you have to use to to push the tile through to get a cut like that do I get my ...\n[noise] every goes\nThat Gary has oh he's got a game later on as serious when it comes to this and he doesn't mess around bushes close to the line of the blade as you can see don't pinch the Thailand\n[laughter] going [noise]\nYeah there it is a good job All right now I didn't get hired at now do you guys want to see [laughter] want to see a how you can take a big straight blades out and\nCut occur yes I'm excited about a year ago so you're going to have their color commentator on that okay\nAll right so we've got to have to focus for a second four inch by four inch pile it looks like but he's got a squeaky line in it and you'd think that\nThat would be physically impossible to do [laughter] oh I see what he's doing [laughter] little individual [laughter] go as far as that line line Shane [noise]\nSo we make basically perpendicular to the weekly line and it looked like there's a bunch of [laughter]\nAnd then I guess you'd go knock out [laughter]\nSo how did I lay out those out this takes advantage of the fact is that something we've talked about before sometimes you guys\nThings are not things that are strong aren't strong in every way right\nTile is made out of a a a clay bisque or porcelain bisque very strong impressive string like concrete but like concrete it's brittle so whereas this title will be strong for decades and people stepping on it you make these little cuts like this in it like this\nAnd uh [noise]\nWell you're you're you're just getting here with your fingers and you step off now Smith that\nHour we're going to do is just use the front of the blade as a grinder ... because we're not afraid of the lake and\nThen just cut off [noise] extra [laughter] I Know what I'm doing what\nWhich obviously I'm not going to the high line I'm not going to say something to do it right now but the point being that you then just use the grinder\nAnd you would smoothed that thing out and uh you can do any shape you need to do\nIf you had a I'm not a multi tool but like a Dram Miller rotary tool you could do that same thing you could probably make\nYou just do it I go to dust mask on because again dry dry cutting kicks up a lot of death right it's going to cut it just as well\nBut that's fantastic and you go to these little ... I mean this is a seven inch ah right will be you said but you can rent you could rent them you can read all different sizes you're going to rent\nThe kind of taught you can rent this for probably I'm going to say twenty bucks a day that's great for forty bucks a day you can rent or the the title saw that the professional tile setters are going to use when they come to your house and that's a bigger one much bigger the blade is actually on top\nOf the water doesn't spray at you because of dribbles watered down the the blade in it and it spins away from you there's all sorts of a cool advantages to the big one\nAnd even if you get one of those big ones like that you're going to want to do it in a place where clean up is going to be easy\nAbsolutely you you know you do the stuff outside or or in a in a construction zone sure not in your bedroom next to your new comfort or is this coming up on Sunday this was Sunday this was Sunday yeah I'm going up on Sunday what are we doing on Sunday oh a Sunday we're going to talk about alternative houses\n... oh that's right and ... like small houses small houses tiny houses hay bale houses a steel stole that already cool\nPhone courthouses and mostly not you know it's interesting but there are things that we can learn from each of those uh alternative lifestyles essentially and apply to our own homes\nExcellent dean dean thanks ... at home with dean and you can hear dean show on Sunday right here on ... thanks guys coming back all of our trending stories plus standing by for what Susan Collins is about to announce on the floor of the Senate whether or not she's going to vote in favor or against Brett Kavanaugh for Supreme Court next on Gary and Shannon\nPowell her radio station [noise]\n\nLife are fine I'm Amy King Live from the camp like twenty four hour news or a marine veteran and convicted serial killer Andrew already Alice has been sentenced to death for murdering five women in Southern California can't fight score Ben Carson reports live in\nAnd distortions up his record and testimony at its first hearing\nProduced short lived catch lives which also did ... hours later and\nContinue to live on and be spread through social media interest groups have also spent an unprecedented amount of dark money opposing this nomination\nOur Supreme Court confirmation process\nHas spin and steady decline for more than Thirty Years' wind you can only hope that the Kavanaugh nomination is where the process has finally hit rock\nAgainst this backdrop that it is up to each individual senator to decide what's the Constitution's to advice and consent duty means informed\nBy Alexander Hamilton's federalist Seventy six I have interpreted says to me that the president has broad discretion to consider at nominees philosophy whereas\nMy duty as says senator is to focus on the nominees qualifications as long as\nThat nominees philosophy is within the mainstream of judicial by\n[noise] I have always supposed ... has spurred judicial nominees with respect to their personal views or politics\nBut I fully expect them to be able to put aside any and all personal preferences in deciding the case and say come before them\nI never considered the president's the density or part and wet enough value waving Supreme Court nominations as a result\nI voted in favor of justices Roberts and Alito Hoover nominated by President Bush\nJustices Sotomayor and kc fans who weren't nominated by President Obama and justice Gorsuch was nominated by President Trump\nSo I began my evaluation of judge Kavanaugh's nomination\nBy reviewing his twelve year record on the DC circuit court of appeals including his more than three hundred opinions and his many speeches and law review article\nNine teen turning including lawyers from the non partisan congressional Research Service freaks me many times each week and it says to me in the value waiting the judges extensive record\nI met with judge Kavanaugh for more than two hours in my office\nI listen carefully to the testimony ethics committee hearing I spoke with people who knew him personally such as ... civil rights and many out there\nAnd I talked to when judge cabinet or a second time by phone for another hour to ask him very specific additional questions\nI also have met with thousands some my constituents spoke the advocates and many opponents regarding judge Kavanaugh\nOne concern that I frequently heard was set the judge would be likely to eliminate the Affordable care act's vital protections for people with preexisting conditions\nI disagree with ... contention in just sent in seven sky V. holder judge Kavanaugh rejected a challenge to be a C a\nR narrow procedural grounds per serving of law in fall\nMany experts have said that his dissent in foreign Justice Roberts' opinion up holding the A. C. A. at the Supreme Court\nFurthermore judge cabinet us approach toward the doctrine of separate belote is narrow\nWind up part of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds he has argued for severing be invalid laws as surgically as possible while allowing the overall law to remain intact\nVince what's his approach and his sending a case that involved a challenge to the structure of the consumer financial Protection Bureau\nIn his stand judge cabinet I argued for quote severing any problematic portions well I'm leaving the remainder intact and quote\nGiven the current challenge is to be a ca proponents including my cell phone\nProtections for people with preexisting conditions should want to adjust his who would take just this kind of approach\nAnother research and that I heard often is that judge Kavanaugh cannot be trusted if a case involving alleged wrongdoing by the president were to come before the court\nThe basis for this argument seems to be two fold\nFirst judge Kavanaugh has written that he believes said Congress should enact legislation to protect presidents from criminal prosecution or civil liability while in opposite\nMr President I Believe opponents miss the mark on this issue the fact that judge Kavanaugh I offered this legislative proposal suggests that the print he believes that the president does not have\nSuch protection currently second there are some who\nArgued that given the current special counsel investigation President Trump should not even be allowed to nominate adjust says\nThat argument ignores our recent history President Clinton in Nineteen Ninety three nominated Justice Ginsburg after the whitewater investigation\nWas already underway and she was come first served Ninety six to three the next year just three months after independent counsel Robert fifth was named to lead the whitewater investigation president\nClinton nominated justice briar he was confirmed eighty seven to nine\nSupreme Court justices have not hesitated to rule against the presidents who have nominated them\nPerhaps most notably in the United states versus Nixon three next send up point keys who heard the case joining the ... opinion against him\nMaine senator judge in California is talking on the ...\nAnd his belief that no president is above the law he\nHas stated that Marlboro ... first is Madison Youngstown field versus Sawyer and the United states versus Nixon arts three of the four greatest Supreme Court cases and history why do they have in common each of them\nIs a case where Congress served as the chat on presidential power and I would note that the fourth case the judge cabinet has pointed to as some the greatest thing history was brown versus the board of education [noise]\nOne cabinet dissension illustrates the point about a check on presidential power directly he wrote the opinion and calmed down and birds and the United states where\nThey can have a Central Asia challenge of Maine announced their decision that could determine a judge Kavanaugh's faith in terms of whether or not he is confirmed as Supreme Court\nBut by law but by law we have to offer you must you opportunity thousand\nDollars or you can when you were shot at one thousand dollars now expect the worst thing that two hundred two hundred you'll get attacked confirming every plus I'd already went from better data and messaging like supply that bank to two hundred two hundred who's in\nCollege but a wrap this up so she can answer her phone might be from a number you don't recognize if you win a thousand dollars you're next chance to win coming up between what five one twenty\nTwo back to the center for says we don't\nMake decisions based on who people are\nOr their policy preferences or at the moment we face this sessions on the law and the\nOther side it's met with have expressed concern said Justice Kennedy's retirement threatens the rights of same sex couples to marry yet judge Kavanaugh\nDescribes the ... which legalized same gender marriages as an important landmark precedence\nHe also cited Justice Kennedy's recent masterpiece caged cakes shop opinion\nFor the court's majority stating that quote the days of treating gay and lesbian Americans are gay and lesbian couples as second class citizens who are in theory or in dignity and words\nOver in the Supreme Court and\nOthers have suggested that the judge holds the extreme views on birth control in one case judge Kavanaugh occurred that does favor or both sides of the political spectrum for seeking to ensure the availability of contraceptive services for women\nWhile minimizing the involvement of the employers with religious objections\nAlthough his critics frequently overlook since point judge Kavanaugh's dissent rejected arguments that the government does not have a compelling interest in facilitating access to conquer\nShe indicated that not only does she not remember and I like that but also that she does not even know Brett Kavanaugh in addition to\nThe lack of corroborating evidence we also learned some facts have raised more questions for instance since these allegations have become public professor Ford testify that not a single person\nHas contacted her to say\nI was at the party that not\nFurthermore the professor testified that although she does not remember how she got home that evening she knew that because of the distance she would've needed or bright\nYet not a single person has come forward to say that they were the ones who drove her home or were in the car with her that night\nAnd professor Ford also indicated that even though she left that small gathering of six or so people looked at ... am without saying goodbye\nAnd to strive\nNone of them called or the next day or\nTo ask why she left is she okay not even her closest friend ms Kaiser\nMr President the constitution does not provide guidance on how we are supposed to evaluate these competing claims it leaves set his says and up to each senator this is not a criminal trial and I do not\nSo well let me pull out of this because I think we all see the writing on the wall right Susan Collins going through all of not all of them but several of Kavanaugh's decisions as a federal judge and before then\nTalking about how his his admission to the court has confirmation would not be the end of roe v Wade that this has been something that liberals have used since Nineteen eighty to say that a conservative\nJudge or a conservative president who\nConfirms or nominates a judge means the end of ... Ravi way that's not going to happen and then she gets in to Dr\nFord's account of the night in question about the fact that she doesn't remember X Y and Z I Believe the writing is on the wall that college is going to vote to confirm Kavanaugh will have the votes and will be confirmed to the Supreme Court tomorrow\nYou can't say the politics doesn't play into this bug just based on what she has been saying here what Senator Susan Collins has been saying I feel like she's the one who's been doing the most homework on this ...\nThe FBI did\nVery well I mean and she's doing I mean the ... the majority of what we've heard so far has been her talking about his judicial history Ryan his time on the appeals court in fact she referred to Merrick Garland Merrick Garland of course was the guy that Obama has nominated you never got the confirmation hearings Mitch McConnell blocked it\nBut she said listen how can you be so adamantly opposed to judge Kavanaugh when Merrick Garland who was your favorite person in the world a year ago when he agreed with Ninety six percent or whatever it was of\n[laughter] funny I work there what's new today on the free I our radio\nFor decorating the house or just setting the very moved\nBy the platelets has killed tracks with labor inspiring when no after de\nBlanc mixture you break out all our great failure party playlists whether you're at home or the stadium knew I already ... collection\nWhy do you hear what I mean John and Ken [laughter] thick fog KFI\nCan try to bring her\nRuns you can only\nGet about the whole are known historical day with the Supreme Court and little talk about I Am forgot about that\n... well I'm just saying the Astros are ahead or they're beating Cleveland right now for enough in their home in a statement that the divisions are I mean I was also watching Susan Collins bill speaking cypress swamp watch\nWe're all going and\n[noise]\nWe have a lot of it I'm Susan Collins the Republican from Maine [noise] just finished up her speech a couple of seconds ago by saying she will vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court justice um all of the senators are getting their opportunities to go through and speak\nAbout their opinions on judge Kavanaugh this morning there was a procedural vote\nIt was scored fifty one to forty nine to end debate put a time limit on debate and do what actual confirmation vote that will probably come sometime tomorrow early early Sunday but ah with Collins' vote for the affirmative it appears that it is a done deal and that in fact Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nSome issues that have come up though as a result of that and whether or not he would be a facing pressure to recuse himself\nSpecifically cases about partisan politics perhaps and cases about sexual assault\nBecause of Thursday last Thursday's testimony when he clearly a blamed left wing opposition groups and people who were trying to get revenge on behalf of the Clintons\nHeat so would that would that come into play\nYeah his line from Thursday was this whole two week effort has been a calculated orchestrated political hit fueled with her parents pent up anger about President Trump the twenty sixteen election fear that it's been unfairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups\nUm the the interesting thing about a Supreme Court justice and recusing him or herself from a case like this is that if you were in a lower court obviously since the Supreme Court is the ultimate judicial branch body\nOr a lower court judge decision to recuse him or herself from that could be reviewed regional national judicial body should be able to review that\nWho reviews the Supreme Court's decision to recuse a Supreme Court justice or no one ... you and I write but the court of public opinion holds zero sway when it comes to a judicial decision right\nIt's just a you know here's some recent examples of ... there was the case in\nTwo thousand four one ... went on a duck hunting trip with Dick Cheney and a few months later took part in a ruling on whether Cheney could withhold documents about that Enron situation\nAnd he voted in Cheney's favor Scalia issuing a memo defending his participation in the case saying he had never discussed it with Chaney that friendship was not grounds for Rick ... recusal\nAnd that if the Supreme Court justice can be bought so cheap for the nation as a deeper trouble than I had imagined\nI mean it's a strong defense but it's one of those where I'm not sure why a a a Supreme Court justice would even find it advisable to do something\nRepublicans called for Ruth Bader Ginsburg to recuse herself from the case over the legality of President Trump's travel ban concern based in media interviews during which she had called Trump a Fager says whatever comes in who is head at the moment\nOf course Trump famously responded for calling for Ruth Bader Ginsburg to resign from the court she did apologize for comments shortly afterward calling them ill advised a but did not offer an explanation for her failure to recuse herself from from that travel ban case\nLooks like a Joe Manchin has also said that he would vote yes to confirm judge Kavanaugh so that gives them the fifty one that they would need yeah a fifty I mean all the neatest fifty as Pence Mike Pence would break the tie in the event um so it looks like that's a done deal is just a matter of time we did say that there was a funny wrinkle\nOr if you want to call it that Steve Gaines is a senator from the state of Montana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain he has a Democrat but he is up for a stiff reelection campaign a very tough I guess I should say reelection campaign there in the midterms in a very red state that voted for President Trump and twenty sixteen now\nLook this could potentially change between now and the actual Senate confirmation but it will not but those five people those five people that we were looking at Susan Collins was the last ... to give an indication one way or the other and of course she said that she would vote yes Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nShe has not nobody's been able to pin down on a specific yes or no but she did say earlier today that\nKavanaugh is not the right man for the court at this time so you could read that as a most likely that would be a no Jeff Flake said that he would be a yes on Kavanaugh\nHis quote unless something big happens which in the next twenty four hours from knows what that could be\nLike I mentioned Joe Manchin from West Virginia Democrat he would be a yes and then a Heidi Heitkamp who is in a similar situation as Joe mansion in that she's a Democrat running for reelection in a heavily Republican state she came out today and said that she is a no in North Dakota\nLet's not underestimate the victory let lap that uh Mitch McConnell is taking now uh he was able to ... block I democratic nominee to the court for more than a year he has been able to strong arm dozens of appeals and district court nominees through the Senate this is what he does and this may be his crowning moment\nSan Diego it's\nTime to go well I mean we're leaving one of the things that my daughter ah she'd been more aware of the Senate in the last week and a half than any sixteen year old needs to be because it's been on the TV and we you know you do stories about it and she hears us to talk about it\nAnd her only comment was I mean she wasn't interested in the allegations she wasn't interested in the in the ... minute show of a Supreme Court confirmation\nProcess or any of that stuff or question to me was how old are those people and I had the\nIt's a very teenage observations yes but at the same time there's a point where how many how many eighty five year olds are you going to allow to be in charge of your insert name of thing here outside of a bingo game I Believe Thursday\nOr a lot of headlines and a lot of questions and comments came out of Thursdays testimony one of them was and how about some term limits what are we going on here\nThat something wrong with that and I said you know it started about comedy and he was in Collins\nA and\nObviously a very smart woman that's been able to hold on to that seat there are a long time um and as you know on the other side of the aisle Dianne Feinstein did a bang up job for Democrats um my my\nResponse to her was ... you know not that she should just vote for young people because they're young but being old does not necessarily grant you all of the wisdom or mean that you should stay in your seat as long as you can\nBut that's not just just to be\nEasy there as
