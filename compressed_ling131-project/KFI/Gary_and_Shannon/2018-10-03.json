I'm only KTLA five\nCamp I Am six forty station\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nYeah bye And here it is a a Wednesday morning October third are ready to talk of the hour we're going to be taking a marginal phone calls\nMe handle on the law off the air or future broadcast and it's my normal show where I scream at you you asked me questions I tried to humiliate you would easily works\nEight seven seven five to zero eleven fifty starting at ten o'clock eight Seventy seven five to zero eleven fifty also ah up on Instagram a story that we have not done on the news we do this every day stories that we don't get to and this was kind of find at bill handle show All right dean\nSharp house wish for nine o'clock or all on a all social media at home with dean\nAnd so let's continue on alternative homes and we'd gone through a few of them steal state house as opposed to wouldn't ... of the two by fours and the new by sixes whatever\n... we talked about that and I almost almost built my house with steel start housing because it made the fire proving the anti termites and makes all the center in the world it does couldn't get a contractor to do it couldn't get someone who knew framing that could put it up yeah that's tricky\nThat's and that's one of the reasons why I said at the top of the last segment\nPractical takeaways find architects designers and builders who embrace the new ideas\nIt's tough it's tough because it takes a long time to apprentice and train as a builder and you train in a certain way and then you know all industries do this white coal miners don't want to bring an end to coal right even though we're way past it so\nIt takes a very special kind of build or to keep themselves in the loop and keep moving forward because it's not just about oh that's a cool idea it's about building a business around it so that you can make a profit now it is the framing part is a little more expensive what ten Fifteen Percent more yeah ten Fifteen Percent more benefits but it makes all the sense in the rural\nHas it'll last for ever and people who have concerns about steel as opposed to would well it's not sustainable no no no\nIt's more so steel is a fully recycled ... some odd recycle ... in the world exactly and so it's actually a green building when you think about it ... up but the techniques again now there's a relationship you know with steel\nAnd hay bale\nHouses and skyscrapers all have in common with tutor framed houses from the fifteenth century\nIs that they are all based on this concept of a timber frame or what we call a balloon frame so when we're talking about steel studs most the studs just like in this building here most of the studs on these partition walls are not structural studs they're not holding up wait there just dividing up rooms\nSo you have a larger steel members that are holding the main way of the house and then we're filling in the walls with non structural steel and what that\nAllows when you design a house that way you can have some big cavernous large open spaces without columns or posts are walls and the way so that whole open playing field or you can get that with uh all of these techniques\nOh yeah we have some ... there's a lot of steel in our house but not steal studying which ... which I wondered if you couldn't do it All right ah this I saw it a couple of conventions a couple of a building shows uh the insulated concrete form housing the icy of housing again\nIt made all the sense in the world but there's nobody out there the dust is there are a few now\nA ... and here in Southern California I could point you to three or four builders who are just tearing it up when it comes to ICS insulated concrete forms of what ... what is it an insulated concrete form now traditionally if we're going to pour a concrete wall we've got all this big would framing that goes up to build the forms\nOr we're using like cinder blocks and were stacking them\nInsulated concrete forms the blocking itself or made out of phone\nWe stack them like phone bricks they all in her locked they have hollow corps and so once we've built this entire wall out of foam leg goes basically\nThen we fill the core of that wall with steel and poured concrete and that\nWall stays the foam on the outside\nThe concrete corps and the phone on the inside the foam on the inside gets covered in dry wall when we want to run electrical and climbing the foam is two inches thick so we cut notches in the phone and we basically run everything in the film betting so is there as\nMuch concrete as you would put in if it weren't for them is the phone there's less concrete yeah and you know would a ... so how does it work structurally structurally it's brilliant I mean if there's enough concrete to make it completely under lock structure\nEarthquake proof insulation off the charts uh it's it's an amazing structure again\nMm Fifteen twenty percent more than ... initial construction costs energy savings over the life of the house negate fed and brings it to net zero\nAll right fair enough uh Gary\nAreas just looking the other beers or looking the other way Alex was talking to be\nOkay and you're by the way Sundays from nine to eleven in the morning a house whisper and at home with dean\nOn social media and the podcast Yes sir that our archive and probably the most part a pod cast we have is that on the planet well it's certainly on KFI only because there is basically your TED Talks on building is what this is All right Gary\nWhat's going on with your well we have the latest on this gigantic home of a report from the New York times on the Trump taxes it's more of an indictment of his father than it ever was Donald Trump I think there's not much we don't we all knew hey rich people don't pay all the taxes\nAnd he was a master of gaming the system but the activation I was always being he actually went beyond that the New York times said he went way beyond\nShow my question is why wouldn't the New York state tax authority already have this guy on the radar why are they saying that the New York times report\nFired up an investigative body that they had never thought of before and they as ridiculous as it doesn't make any sense um the new Kavanaugh stuff of course including a letter from a doctor Christine Blasey Ford's former boyfriend who talked about lie detector tests and whether she'd ever had any knowledge or work with polygraph test\nAnd then and it turns out she got her PHD in polygraph well not so much for me it's definitely not an officer or off topic thing for her and then a a story about a woman who's not liquor and do a movie theater\nIn her kids sip a cup and uh\nI'm gonna let you guess which one of us in the office shrugged her shoulders and said it's not a big deal everybody does that so we're talking about sneaking liquor into places that you're not supposed to have it All right like handles house yeah exactly\nUh all of that going on also I'm taking phone calls for handle on the law off the air and I'm starting just a few moments if you would like some marginal legal advice for your margin legal questions call eight seven seven five to zero eleven fifty Hoffman up next was Shannon\nA dean up on Sunday you I'm sure you're talking about housing on Sunday yeah okay go eat a lot going on handle here in the morning crews see tomorrow this is an old Gary by the way have good changes is that does that does it do you ever believe it I mean that\nSometimes know sometimes you actually look at me I Know but that's that's me attempting sincerity and it's very very difficult KFI am six forty\nOkay bass than to let her radio play curry acts to Trump I'm Julie Slater live from the KFI twenty four hour news rooms Republican Senator Jeff flake says President Trump's mocking of Brett Kavanaugh's accuser\nChristine Blasey Ford was not right and kind of appalling\nLike hasn't said if he'll vote to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is the one who asked that the FBI be given a week to investigate forwards claims President Trump mocked for it last night at a rally in Mississippi talking about all the things she couldn't remember about her alleged assault\nCell phones across the country will buzz around eleven Eighteen this morning with a presidential alert test from FEMA the system is meant to be used for a major nationwide emergencies like nuclear or terror attacks FEMA's weighed Widmer says the test should reach about Seventy five percent of all cell phones\nThere's no technical way to opt out of receiving the message um your phone or receive the message and displays of two and then once you hit the dismissed button\nOn your phone message has gone\nSome people have sued females because they can't opt out Widmer says the phone alerts were developed because lots of people might miss an alert over the radio or TV\nUm I just read what for what Nick wrote for our group segment what do you see\nThat's why I wanted to do the segment that quote right there oh\nYou can read it I don't know if I can yes you can write went in for a vagina egg\nCame out with nothing ... know you keep that you can isolate that\nUh we have a bunch that we're going to get to do with um sneaky alcohol speaking of alcohol there was a story about a mom who got busted for sneaking liquor into a movie I don't understand why this is news well this is a Tuesday it was at a kid's sip ... which I guess is what causes the problems but we wanted to ask what's the craziest\nPlace or the craziest way you snuck alcohol somewhere\nGet to us on Twitter at Gary I'm Shannon yeah go through your response of praying obvious place that you're not going to or the craziest way that you snuck it into some play yes All right we'll talk about that little bit like we should get cabin on the phone and [laughter] All right this bombshell\nReport about the taxes and the Trump family to me I don't know how you feel but when I heard this it is not a bombshell\nAnd who didn't think that this happened and when you have more money than God\nPeople do this kind of stuff all the time\nThere's an expectation I've always had an expectation that there's a certain income level I don't know what it is I don't know where the number is yeah that you find a way to reduce the amount of taxes that you're going to pay\nAnd I don't mean just you know you hire an accountant I mean you hire a few account\nMove money around your money or get out of the country that sort of\nPut it in other people's names that that goes on all the time now I think the reason that this was interesting to me is that the president has\nRepeatedly said that he just got a million dollar loan I Believe from his father right and the New York times report says that the president received at least four hundred Thirteen million from his father over the decades\nI don't\nI don't and exactly I mean the one thing it does is it is erodes the the ongoing um narrative that the president has for a long time said about himself\nRight back when he was billionaire Donald Trump real estate guy when he was candidate Trump and has been a president he would say things like I'm a self made billionaire I did all of this myself\nI don't know if anybody believe that in the first place and to be honest I don't care\nI don't care either and it's the same thing with Brett Kavanaugh and the testimony saying that I busted my bus to get into Yale he was a legacy at Yale you know what I mean like there was his grandfather went there and you know if if you're a legacy or your dad gave you a bunch of money through the years and then just be honest about it don't don't don't bill yourself as a self made man\nBefore you eat before you bore yourself to death by reading the New York times article Fifteen thousand word essay on the Trump money it says basically that\nDad Trump Fred\nAvoided gift an inheritance taxes by setting up a a sham corporation or by undervaluing assets to tax authorities\nA lawyer for Trump told the times there was no fraud or tax evasion and the fact cited in the report are extremely inaccurate\nWhite House\nThey're quote was it's misleading attack against the Trump family by the failing New York times yeah\nI mean the thing is the New York state tax department told the pie that they're going to review these allegations in the times shame on the New York tax department if you didn't already have multi billionaires in your sights\nThere's nothing wrong with keeping an eye on guys who have multi billions of dollars and hundreds of millions moving day to day through an Internet\nThere's nothing wrong with keeping an eye on those guys make sure they play by the rules why does it take a New York times article for you to to wake up and go ... go make four hundred million dollars or maybe I should a jacket on their taxes there\nThe times says that before Fred Trump die the dad in the late nineties he transferred the ownership of most of his real estate was for a living children\nAre the same properties would be sold off over the next decade and it looks like the president's father and mother transferred over a billion to their kids and that should have produced a tax bill of five hundred fifty million dollars instead the children paid fifty two million or about five percent\nThis and write this happens all the time\nIt's that it's got a Trump name associated with it it's at the New York times had Fifteen thousand words that they were ... they were just waiting for this this is gonna fall so flat this is going to fall so ridiculously flat but I I mean there are people are going to read this and go see\nI told you he cheated ... I\nThink that they cheated on their taxes like most people with ... money do anyway All right coming up next we've got a handwritten letter from Brett Kavanaugh that's now in the spotlight from Nineteen eighty three [noise]\nAgain [laughter] well we were going through high school age correspondence yep that's what's happening\nDoes it start with beer beer no but if the city of dying on it uh the signature on it the earth is ... what do you call it is F F F F F ... love\nThose apps All right we've got a thousand dollars to get away from your sided one thousand dollars' sake fix your cash doing you'll get a text affirming every plus I really only folks that are dead and missing like the part that cash for two hundred two hundred over\n... you got to answer that phone even if it's from a number you don't recognize your next chance one's going to be next hour between ... you know five after and twenty after so something like that you have a chance to win a thousand dollars an hour Monday through friday from five AM to six twenty P.

accusation he was tweeting Chuck Grassley was by yeah Chuck Grassley tweets anything\nChuck Grassley office tweeted that earlier today um after the uh the rally last night\nAll right we've been talking about what you're watching once they some of the TV\nShows that are going on and it looks like it looks like once we see one style of show that works and we've seen this since TV started it's\nA race up with another why what is\nThe next this is Austin is going to make everyone cry and come in and say oh my God I Can't believe that Randall got in the car\nAnd ABC through their hat into the ring with the million little pieces a million little the million little thing\nWell about friendship it's not a big ... big things it's a million little things that the just All right it's\nFour guys that met in an elevator a decade ago when the elevator got stuck and they were in there for a while and one of the guys who kind of seems to be the alpha male in in the group of friends says hey we all love the penguins I think it is let's get a penguin season tickets\nHockey I is it penguins yes okay\nAnd Pittsburgh yes yes sure and uh so they start this friendship of going to the games forty something games a year and they become friends and this guy who convinced them all to go in on season tickets it never let them pay for the season tickets by the way\nVery odd and they were all friends and he ends up in the first episode of the season he ends up jumping out of the building of his office building\nAnd everyone is so perplexed why would he do this and so there's a lot of flashbacks there's a lot of things that have happened in a group of friends somebody maybe having sex with somebody else's wife or that kind of a thing the dialogue is not at this is us level it seems\nReally cheap at times it seems hack at times\nI liked the idea of the interwoven stories and the secrets that are going to come out and how they all uh work with each other but the dialogue is like mid to late nineties level\nNow one of the things that this is us does from what I've seen is that they do a lot of the back and forth there's two or three sort of time yes uh segments that they concentrate on its like\nWest world in that way yeah well hold on [laughter]\nI Would say Westworld intentionally confused as you about where you are I'm but this is just makes it very clear that does the million little things do that I mean they make it clear that they're talking about yeah happened in the past yes\nThey do yeah but what do you think so far I mean is it the watching I'm going to give it a couple of episodes and I do like the idea behind it we uh we\nHad been told multiple times to watch shameless right the Showtime show with William H may see me Ross summit cetera yeah my wife picked up on that\nAnd my wife has been watching as she like as she's been been judging that whole so she'll be doing work and that thing is playing in the background so she's I wouldn't say she's invested in it but she's deep enough into it now she's going to have to finish gonna have to go all the way through\nAnd I have good news for everybody that's below deck is back from here last night [laughter]\nAnd they do have to\nTape that had Stewart and they kept kept in Lee but all the others and Amy part about that but you could at least pretend you're listening to me oh I was I'm not I'm just kidding I'm kidding [laughter] um\n[laughter] but uh the rest of the crew there all different usually they keep a couple of ... from the last season are all different and you know what I was wondering if it's going to make a difference it doesn't as long as you have the captain Lee and Kate the rest of the matter than I Am just wondering who's gonna hook up with who and who's going to get drunk who's going to follow the boat who's going to screw up the toys I'm\nThere are two other things that I that uh we started this week or one that one of the things we started this week and one that I'm interested in one of them was the second season of a typical which is another Netflix show Jennifer Jason Leigh and Michael Rapaport and it's about ... the family of an autistic teenager\nHe that to me sounds like a chore like it's going to depress me it sounds like work that um have to put in like I'm In his family and its work\nI wouldn't say it's hilarious\nBut it is more funny than it is dramatic okay um there are a couple of like sad moments in it and there are times that it is uncomfortable but in general I Would say a typical was a fun okay I guess that's fun as you can get talking about dealing with a kid who is who who's on the spectrum\nBut they are very open about it and the kid is totally conscious of his own autism so it's not as if\nA ... you know they're trying to do a show about a kid that he doesn't know what he's very aware of it as a therapist you know mom and dad are having some issues the older sister or a younger sister is also um has to deal with the soldier anyway two seasons in\nOr I should say season and a half and they still do a great job and I like Michael Rapaport a lot and he plays a character here that's not the sort of rough and tumble

[noise]\nShannon ... sorry Gary and chanting [noise]\nAlmost mom why stay sober third in Tommy Joyce and we've been\nFollowing we expect to have a report from the FBI very soon about the uh [noise] allegations against Brett Kavanaugh but as we were saying um it appears that the FBI agents did not talk to\nJudge Kavanaugh or doctor Christine Blasey Ford buttons that are going to be relying on\nTheir testimony before the Judiciary Committee\nFor their version of the events that were being investigated\nCopy one copy the reports are expected to go to the White House the other to the Senate Judiciary committee where it will be shared with the other senators in a secure environment is what\nThey're saying very odd news about the White House not letting\nThe FBI interview the two people in question Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford and saying that the FBI needs use their testimony her lawyers say they'll turn over notes from her therapy sessions and any recordings ever taken a lie detector tests the FBI at the bureau agrees to interview her\nNow they're making deals here I don't know what the hell's going on well\nThe autopsy reports version and watching her two daughters had been completed and handed over to the man charged with their murders\nYeah court document that was filed this week showed that the prosecution or has the autopsy reports of should in Belo ... watch and they have provided that documentation to the defendant the the discovery process which just means if one side gets evidence they turn it over to the other side's they're both working on a a level playing field\nReports took almost two months to complete\nHere is a a a possibility that was brought up though on a couple of different reports of the autopsy report [noise] [noise] oh we know that the report is going to remain in a secret is going to be kept under seal at the request of the prosecution in this case and\nThere is some speculation that the reason prosecution wants that under under seal is because there may not be enough DNA evidence\nTo secure a conviction in the murder of the girls\nThe bodies were not found until three days after their debts they were in a nearly full oil tank during the hottest months\nOf the year here's the thing they don't need DNA evidence to secure a conviction ...\nNo it would be a slam dunk it'd be it would be very nice to have it but it's not going to be a conviction based on DNA evidence it's gonna be probably more of a circumstantial case or the other thing is what did they find\nIn the home because those dogs you know found something in the home\nWhere we we can hear them alerting when he when that interview right um I Wonder if this is one of those um I've heard this before\nI've never really talked to a specific investigator about this but that there's an added to sort of a CSI attitude about convicting someone of a murder like this\nThat there would always be you know CSI always put the pieces together and they always have the smoking\nGun to use the term evidence of DNA or of the trace something that the murderer left at the crime scene and in this case if the murder occurs within the home\nThe guy's DNA is all over the place where it's not like it's they're going to see that and and do that he was in the home and committed this crime where he shouldn't have been I Wonder if that's just sort of a reaction to DNA evidence\nIs considered that thing which is going to be the slam dunk but in this case it doesn't they don't even need it necessarily\nIt's just it's a strange attitude it seems that has come out of you know people who investigate these types of things DNA is not always necessary right\nI think it makes for a good headline to a ... D N A evidence not enough DNA evidence to secure a conviction and I'll get that gets more clicks gives you like what do you mean how how do you not convict that guy and then when you think about it it's like well of course they don't it would just be on the DNA evidence alone kind of thing is what they\nKnow the um what I think it's interesting as well as the defense was fighting against the prosecution\nDemand for prints fingerprints palm prints\nFeet prince footprints I guess you'd call them now in America I'm based on the general nature of the pleading the defendant can't make out the governments need for black hole or is that I ... you see the ale buckled swabs finger and palm prints digital photographs\nSaid that they can't figure out why the prosecution would walk though so we're not going to turn them over right now [noise] [laughter] well and part of it wouldn't have part of that'd be his the booking process they're going to get yeah at least fingerprints from him for that\nHe has been sitting in that in jail for more than a month's he's cut off from most of the media coverage a there was a source who speaks with him that talked to people magazine saying that he spends twenty three hours a day in his cell under close watch protocol\nTechnical name for suicide watch he has no TV no reading material once a day he goes to the common room where he's alone there was a communal newspaper that he is free to read", "show_name": "Gary and Shannon", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "03"}
