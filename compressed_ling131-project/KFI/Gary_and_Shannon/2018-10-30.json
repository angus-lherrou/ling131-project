{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "Right so assuming that there isn't a soy use available or by then uh what are the choices they go ahead and take a chance I mean they have no choice right on a rocket that I have some issues or do they speed up by for example the dragon a with a space sex\nI mean what what would they do\nThat really exciting question can those guys let's face facts and Boeing get certified earlier in the answer is probably not that timeframe you really want to be back up the I assessed within a few months so terrible because once it starts with trouble you can't talk and NASA has limited amount of control the ground [noise]\nSo ah the choice really either speed up the sugar case from the Russian side or find some other way up there were dropped from the very limited it's highly unlikely but in theory the Chinese terms though could do it\nAnd so what happens these people are staying longer up there I'm assuming the astronaut and do they have enough work going 'cause I Know they were planned I they're up there ah when they're up there I'm Sorry they're ah they're they're planned events and they have experiments Saturday to do do they take a vacation now that they're done no\nThey got tons of work to do and that that extends out as as long as they're there it's always planned followed it back to the issue is they don't want to stay there beyond the certification of a white votes for years they have dog so if they're not sure when another one come up they're just going to have to come home and the space station awful for a few months\nBut I mean they can if they have to do is like yeah you can buy milk or past it's a ... a due date right best sell date I mean you know it's not gonna hurt you or is this going to hurt you other than the capsule exploding everybody dying\n[laughter] you know it's not likely I think what they're really worried about as well as their leaks with the battery brought down or you know if it's really a little problems like that which turned into big problems where you're coming home but I suspect they will probably extend the certification to date a bit like you're saying\nAnd just try and rush the other one through to get one off the ground against sooner\nAll right let's move over to the Hubble a which is a been successful beyond all beliefs and he's been up in space far longer than anybody anticipated a I Know there was some issues we're talking about one of the gyros going\nOut and I you know they had to shut it down I understand they brought it back up again and how can they replace those gyros and can this thing continue for several years\n[laughter] they did replace the gyros back in I think it was two thousand nine and uh they added the new one on one hand so they can run better their finger printing it like your point to record took thousand rpm so they're they are aware item\nUm we ... again 'cause we don't have a way to get that high of books that were to figure out something with the rhyme and that's the last few years off because it's going to be Thirty Years' old pretty soon to forgive given for decades\nAnd assuming that the James Webb telescope gets up there a couple of years like as opposed to a deploys properly like real because\nIt's going to make Hubble looked like a very small telescope humble about may ... mirror a Web much much bigger so it's a matter of a of a crime to get replaced with something that they were and try to go\nTo west right whether yeah these journalists could watch other stuff you're\nHey and how do we replace him in two thousand nine and can't replace him now\nWe have a show and it was able to do very high orbit got up to where the Hubble is\nRhonda who you are referring arm for for the arriving I'm not sure we're going to be able to do that they won't\nHave a robotic arm so they'd have to actually rock duty just throw up in space and we really do that if we don't have to\nYeah sure I so but it let me throw something out you I was thinking\nUh I Know when the Web goes up is going to blow out the the ... capabilities like we've never seen before but you would think keeping the Hubble and doing is scientific research in addition to the Web would be a ... it's a perfect combination\nThat is really what you want because ah it's a little bit like the Mars rovers you're you want to have opportunity and ... you can make observations the reports were planted the where there's an infrared telescope Hubble is optical wavelengths\nSo ideally you want to have both but you know I was surprised at how long you can keep talking about how long how much money you're spending\nBut the public really as you pointed out we started a public relations value of that and that's a different explanation way more than they ever expected it got so many people ... up about space cook those images\nYou work a lot to keep it going oh yeah you definitely would love them both\nOr I ride a just a quick announcement are coming up Thursday and friday the space settlements summit at USC a rod is helping to run it\nAnd you can I'm assuming just go to our website and you know all the information correct yes earth remind\nYou about it have a good one Rob Ficker alright alright rod pile in just space stuff you know you're interested in that at all and\nCool space news yeah you got it you know it's always ... I think it's so do you ever go outside look at the space station overhead no\nOh you don't think that's cool yeah I just never have done it you should do it\nYou can set a little uh ... download an app on your phone and I was a little armed will go off every time it's right over your head as he can just walk outside your door and and look up and waved to the space station\nYou see a little light it goes pretty quickly how cool\nIs that hey I Know what else is go look at this remember that event we went to not that long ago and there was a guy there and he was wearing a Gary and Shannon shirt yeah and you lost your mind because you didn't have a shirt he wasn't wearing your shirt yes\nHe sent me this oh that's so cool cool\nYeah and that's ah my picture of a\nThe gamble and the wig and it

once and it turns into a Wednesday for a for an infant yeah pretty much disease or God's name these are going\nAnd what size is is I don't think it's a oh excelling that where\nIt's All right so we've got a constitutional crisis coming up on the fourteenth amendment versus the president versus his executive order power a ... is not\nReally clear on the Constitution's your article to mentions executive order but nowhere is there a provision that explicitly\nPermits the use of executive orders but I think what may come into play and you can tell me if I'm wrong is the Supreme Court just weighed about ... just a just gave their opinion about executive orders and we're doing the travel ban nonsense yes it did in ... and in the majority opinion a John Roberts wrote\nThat we must consider the authority of the presidency itself\nYeah except when it's clear cut in the constitution there's nothing in the constitution says the president may not allow Muslims into the country rights as far as this issue is pretty clear although although there was an art there actually is an argument on the other side as stupid as it is\nA it's not coming in from Mars sort of\nOkay alright but anyway it's going to be fun listening to it\nIt is yes I Love I Love the little constitutional ... sounds like victory\n[laughter] anything else going on no that's it All right so it'll be a four

think he understands the negative connotation of the word\nAnd I think people are are holding him to to something that he doesn't have a clue one\nYeah I agree on his trip yeah not without controversy as you said the family of at least one of the eleven people killed at the synagogue rejected a presidential visit in part because of comments that he made after the attack congressional leaders from

that it had been sent in for repairs recently and then it was put back out and service now we're hearing from some passengers who were on a previous flight\nThat sense that plane into repairs to passengers on that flight say that there were some serious issues that the plane dropped suddenly several times and the first few minutes of its flight\nYeah one of the people said that after about three to eight minutes after it took off I felt the plane was losing power an on able to rise happened several times during the flight we felt like we were in a roller coaster some passengers began to panic and vomit again this is the flight before the crash\nHis account is consistent with data from flight tracking sites they show erratic speed altitude and direction and ... minutes after the jet took off and then a similar pattern\nBasically the same thing happened and Monday's doomed flight\nUm the safety experts who are watching this are saying listen we yes the flight you know the uh the flight tracking website that you can use in this case white radar twenty four\nThey are usually pretty good about this sort of thing in terms of um uh the data the flight data but they're going to check for accuracy against the black boxes which they have not yet recovered but they say that they probably will\nThere were reports of these technical problems with the previous flight not the one that crashed but the one that uh got it to Jakarta oh but that they had been resolved in accordance with the manufacturers procedures and\nThey're saying that when they were on the tarmac again going from Bali to Jakarta that there were technical problems that made them sit there for a while\nYeah there was a Indian easy in a T. V. personality Conchita Caroline who was on that flight Sunday she says boarding was delayed by more than an hour and when the plane was being told there was a technical problem that forced to return to its parking space and she says yeah\nWe sat in a cabin without air conditioning for at least a half an hour or listening to an unusual in general or some of the children were vomiting from the overbearing cheat\n\nThey waited for about thirty minutes on the tarmac and then we're told to board again while the engine\nWas checked she said she asked a staff member about what was going\nAnd on and staff member was very defensive saying the the problem's been settled or find\nHim in that nightmare flight or quote he treated me like a passenger full of disturbing dramas even though I was asking represented friends and confused tourists who didn't understand Indonesian ...

I just want to pull the car over quickly to talk about I don't pay taxes on ... what we're talking about yes\nLast year it was the governor that signed this twelve cents per gallon increase in gas into effect we pay in this state forty one point seven cents per gallon\nPer gallon yeah holy hell ... and that increase was a forty percent jump\nThat is criminal you know why because we're already paying so much in this gas tax and what are they doing with it they're missing it into the wind and so they want more they want to go back to that well again and not even go to us for it just sign it into law well\nAnd and the thing is can I say urinating into the wind you did but you you can't here's the thing about what's going on in Sacramento for so long\nThere's a realization that if you just\nTake a little bit more in a little bit more in a little bit more in a little bit\nMore nobody will know no one nobody notices you but then I'm not a little bit more well to forty percent jump\nWhich is why it was not approved by voters right it had to be approved by legislators because nobody in their right mind the thirty nine million people in the state of California would not have approved that they would have said wait a minute wait a minute on a second one I stand there\nAt the gas pump and it says I'm already paying thirty three cents or whatever it is per gallon of a tax where's that money going and you want more right on his own results um have you on your own country highly\nGo drive on the five through Burbank and then tell me what the gas tax has done for us because that's been a third world country is zone over there for as long as I've lived here for\nBreaking Thirteen Years yeah it's been a disaster\nThe liability for your car to even be on that stretch of road if they don't care no they ... they don't care that much money it's our money\nIt's a frustrating thing and by the way you must vote yes on prop six I think that's the only way to do
