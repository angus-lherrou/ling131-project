parking your next chance to win happens within twenty\nOkay with the boss Angeles Orange County or a\nBomb scares I'm Monica ... for the KFI twenty four hour news you're him and it looks like it's\nAll clear now at the San Diego union Tribune John office where senator Kamala Harris his office his house that building was evacuated this morning over suspicious package\nIn her offices down in sunrise Florida\nApparently it was addressed originally to Eric Holder the former attorney general a but it had a wrong address wrong delivery address and that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is address was the return address which is why were sent back to her office or or I should say to her office because it was the return address\nThat's a tactic that has been used before uh in fact Ted Kaczynski used that tactic and the very first bomb that was attributed to him I think at Northwestern University He put the intended target as the return address and then the package was discovered in a parking garage and sent back to the professor at Northwestern\nHillary Clinton is out of Florida fund raiser and she addressed this issue saying that we are fine she thanked the U.S Secret Service for intercepting this explosive device in a package\nLong before it was able to make its way to the Clintons home she was at a fundraiser in coral Gables for the Democratic congressional candidate to there\nShe said to her family's grateful for the secret service the service and commitment and obviously never more than today\nAnd you know they've all taken time whether it's Hillary Clinton or bill de Blasio to talk about the as bill de Blasio put at the hatred in the air currently in this country up at ... he's a word salad guys and he um I mean can't we just talk like a normal person\nNo he's got to talk like you know uh I think you put it I think\nYou said it correctly though when you said it's\nIt's as if they're using language or word choices to try to make themselves seem bigger larger than life larger than a normal or in that order than they really are and I'm not saying that the the mayor of New York is an important person in the grand scheme of things but in an event like this\nThe mayor of New York is just to another talking head at this point I Would rather hear from the FBI I'd rather hear from ATF I'd rather here from New York police department commissioner than the mayor of New York\nWell in the other thing is Rudy Giuliani went not not now not twenty Eighteen Rudy Giuliani but two thousand one Rudy Giuliani was great he came out and he talked to all of us like he was our uncle you know what I mean like a normal person bill de Blasio is not that guy like you said he is a little bit of our study in there\nUm I re tweeted a a picture Brian suits tweeted at just admitted to a couple of minutes ago rich we did it not a ... there's nothing for scale as he mentioned but\nOne of the images that we look at um apparently is a pipe bomb I mean it's a small a length of pipe kept at both ends but with wires coming out of both ends that go to\nSome sort of a device that has been taped onto the side of it and it's hard to tell if that's a timer assuming it's a timer and then would be a fuse of some kind to to ignite whatever bomb went off\nAt this point they have not said anything about whether the timer would have been running whether it was a motion detect whether it was remote controlled anything like that we do know that the device that was found at the CNN building\nWas put it into an NYPD bomb squad truck which was basically a giant maybe six or eight foot across um fear\nAnd then hauled off somewhere in the Bronx it looked like they had a gun range or an open space area that they could take that thing and before they actually detonated do as much investigation as they can safely if if there is such a thing and try to find out as much information as they can before they blow this thing up to render a safe\nThat's suspicious white powder that was also in the package containing that device is right now being tested to see if it is dangerous\nUh CNN was evacuated when they were alive on the air and you could almost see what it is her name poppy Harlem happy Harlow a it was other situations where the um the sirens going off in the building the uh the the fire alarm and she's kind of looking around like what the hell's going on as they're reporting\nOn each other's suspicious devices and you've gotta have that in the back of your head if if if I ... in a media organization it was the first thought I had I was like well they're if they're going after all of these I'm\nLiberal uh figures and they're going to go after the media right they would be a target and then we had to San Diego situation\nYeah well I don't come back we'll explain that one 'cause it's also an interesting whether or not it's connected we're not certain but the timing of it is clearly um something to to pay attention to there was a a hazardous\nMaterials squad was sent out to an area of San Diego it's six between a and B and the building their\nHouses the San Diego union Tribune apparently San Diego fire also has an office there as does centered ... Harris has one of her offices in that building so we'll come back we'll talk about that and uh we go through this list of these places that have been targeted with this uh with these explosive devices All right\nGary and Shannon and we have a chance for you to win one thousand dollars\nA day or shot at one thousand dollars and now the nation like can't word pluck to two hundred two hundred and get a sex confirming entry plus I have a radio invoke standard data method resupply nationwide contest that book to doing it to make\nSure you answer that phone if it's a from a number you don't recognize Israel she their move on to somebody else or when that thousand bucks chance to win a thousand dollars once an hour Monday through friday from five in the morning\nOr six twenty at night Monica Rick's as an update on some other stuff what's up\nWages are hearing ... talking about those bomb scares the White House says it condemns recent attempted attacks on political figures like Hillary Clinton ...

New York the Obamas home in Washington D. C. area\nThe governor of New York Andrew Cuomo and his officers in Manhattan apparently and then also one addressed to the former attorney general Eric Holder that ended up at the offices for Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz CNN also reported that\nThere was another suspicious package that was reported at a congressional male sorting facility somewhere in the Washington DC area and then a bomb squad was on his way or at least there and we don't know much about that one yet\nFBI officials did hold a press conference outside of the CNN building there in New York in Manhattan saying that all the devices appear to be crude pipe bombs the device in New York was black it had wires and had a white powdery substance\nThat they are currently testing to see whether it is dangerous or not again it all started with George Soros and that device send him Monday Night\nAaron ... has been following this story along with just about everybody else in the nation right now and Aaron joins us live what's going on here and\nWell we have a now a total of more than a\nHalf dozen of these devices that were sent to CNN and George Soros and President Obama and Hillary Clinton and Governor Cuomo and former attorney general Eric Holder and now we've just learned that a recipient or on Capitol Hill was intended to be Maxine Waters the Democratic congresswoman\nAnd so there are a number of officers that are taking extra precautions today as the FBI and the secret service and other agencies work to to try and trace the origin of these devices they appear to be related they all appear to be constructed similarly\nAnd they will undoubtedly look for any potential signatures that could help them trace who sent these things\nHow does it work ah when they are intercepted that like for instance the device sent to the Clintons was intercepted before I got to their residents how does that work do we know where where the interception center is and is it the same one that it would be for for a ... ex presidents\nWell not all I mean it it went to their house uh and and before it ever reaches the hands of of Mr and Mrs Clinton it it goes through a a kind of screening but undoubtedly a in this case a caretaker seems to have gotten the the device\nAnd then realized potentially that it needed to be looked at 'em and and there are similar screening procedures at at CNN and and for all Secret Service protect these in the case of congresswoman waters there is a capital males sorting facility in Maryland I think\nBefore any actual mail reaches a member of Congress\nNYPD took away the device that apparently showed up at CNN and they took it to the Bronx one of their bomb squad vehicles 'em before they uh before they blow this thing up or get rid of it in some way they're going to try to investigate to do we know what that process looks like for them\n... like any bomb squad what they're going to do is take a look at the components to see how it was made a they want to see if any of the components have any telltale signs of out where it may have been purchased a in some cases and a bomb investigations of for example the Boston Marathon\nThe manufacturer was I'm Still visible on the pressure cooker and so they were able to determine who in the area so that particular brand of pressure cooker and then ultimately we're able to pinpoint the store and found surveillance video of cameras on his show heart turn I of\nAt the store buying the pressure cooker so if any of these devices or fashion from those kinds of ah of tell tale of ingredients they perhaps can be used to trace the origin of of where these things are getting from\nAaron thank you appreciate your time today and could\nJust be there at the latest on what's ah what's been going on in Washington DC and again he mentioned the half dozen at ... at least a half dozen now because\nWith the device that was found at the home of George Soros you have the Clintons being targeted the Obamas governor Cuomo's Manhattan office an office in Florida of either Eric Holder or a Debbie Wasserman Schultz because apparently both have their names on it\nA Capitol Hill and oranges told us that it may have been congresswoman Maxine Waters who was the address the on that we need for this John Brennan at the CNN offices in New\nYork we may see this all day\nWe are now more packages popping up there just had a picture of the package\nOr sent to a ... and John Brennan misspelled his name ... and it's just like you would think it is somebody writing and block letters uh stamps crudely placed on the top rate of descent manila small package\nIt looks like just like every other a piece of mail that you would get through a CNN office\nYeah but if you saw that listen I mean it's it's one of those imagine like you said the manila envelope maybe a padded envelope in the middle so it's going to have some weight to it but but a a pipe that big\nAssuming there's something in it let's assume there is gunpowder ena because they've described it as what they believe was alive at\nA device that's going to that is going away a couple of pounds and that kind of an envelope when you pick it up yeah\nYou and I would would maybe joke about it and say I'm not yeah let's get Blake to open it that's what we do with all of our mail okay well that but that's what I mean is that is in and that's an unusual thing yes it it does look like every other weird piece of mail that we would get anyone it\nBurbank has got a big Atta Boy is one of them and bad neighborhoods to live in the entire universe I went back to the Exxon KFI\n[noise]\nHearing Shannon [noise] we're\nFollowing this story about the suspicious devices I Want to throw this in there as well there was one winning tickets or for last night's lottery one point six billion almost uh they ... it turned out it was a ticket in South Carolina the officials the lottery officials in South Carolina did not want to announce\nWhere it was sold until they can get police protection around the store and I don't know if they've even released the name yet but it was they said sometime mid\nDay just to correct something up from Aaron ... he had said that the bomb was sent to Hillary and Bill Clinton's home it was not I knew was sent there but it never got there it was intercepted at a facility near their home\nOr so it did not arrive on their front porch or anything like that\nI don't think either one of them are home I Know there's a Hillary Clinton gave a speech earlier this morning in Miami so I I don't even think that the that was an issue\nUm the uh the Obamas were another target CNN officers in New York where a target\nA congresswoman and Florida Debbie Wasserman Schultz was the recipient of a package that was also addressed Eric Holder New York governor Andrew Cuomo apparently received wannabes at his Manhattan offices\nThere was also a report that perhaps Maxine Waters the congresswoman from California was a ... wasn't addressed the on one of these packages that was intercepted or to Capitol Hill male sorting facility there in Maryland and uh that of course George Soros the story we talked about yesterday from the Monday\nA package that was delivered so there are at least seven we're talking about here today a again waiting for the president's remarks on all of this at this point all we know from the White House is a statement from Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nA condemning these things as violent attacks in terrorist attacks and then also I'm a vice president Mike\nPence sent out a lengthy tweet saying that this is absolutely um unbelievable and unacceptable and the president retweeted the vice president's tweet but other than that we haven't heard anything from the president himself even though he is expected to speak at any moment about what's been\nGoing on John Miller is the head of intelligence and counterterrorism for the New York police department yeah he's got some experience with this he says all the confirmed bombs appeared to come from the same person\nOr persons he was talking to reporters in New York outside of the CNN building their um overhead TV shots you could see ... did show a truck carrying\nThe device that were sent to CNN's New York headquarters in Manhattan they said it was linked to the other explosives they took that away\nThe package sent to CNN contained alive explosive and and on below with white powder that substance is being tested to see if it was dangerous New York Governor Cuomo saying at this briefing that we're not going to change our lives for these terrorists noting that this was a terror attack\nUh I've heard a couple of different descriptions I mean I'm I'm seeing a picture of the device it was apparently sent to the CNN offices are addressed specifically to John Brennan who is a a talking head now for ah for CNN\nAnd a couple of different descriptions of it some people have said that it is a fairly sophisticated device and others have said it's very rudimentary in terms of bomb making sophistication\nUh the the description of it is simply that it's a small pipe it looks to be about maybe an inch in diameter and probably six to eight inches long kept on boats and both ends\nOr read why are coming out of one and a black why are coming out of the other and they connect to some sort of an electronic device that's also duct tape to the side of the pipe\nUh assuming that that would be a timer detonate or whatever it would be if there was a remote controlled or not\nAnd you know the obvious point of all of this is to is to instill fear but at this point none of them has gone off none of them have detonated\nAnd nobody has reported any injuries even if it was some suspicious white powder that may have been involved will no one's reported feeling sick or anything like that\nWe are just Thirteen Days away from the mid term elections as to say that this political season has been tense is underestimating it I'm not going to go as far as bill de Blasio and say that there is hatred in the air\nUm 'cause I'm not a poet and need there is he there's someone should let him know hatred in the air but Republicans are scrambling to denounce this right and don't and don't think that there's not a conspiracy theory saying that liberals are behind this\nOh yeah oh yeah it to make Republicans look bad\nTo make the president look bad because of his ridiculous rhetoric when it comes to a tearing down people uh that's why I think it's going to be interesting to see\nHow the president handled this and whatever you know however the speech posted a in response to this I honestly think this was an incredibly important speech for him I think this is an incredibly important time for him to come out and say listen\nUh I may consider these people my political opponents but I ... I Do not condone violence I Would never condone violence and I will ask the Justice Department to go after whatever bone had did this with the to the full extent of the\nLaw I'd like to know more about how pipe bombs work you know are these things that were an actual threat I how are they detonated when do they go off if they go off if they're functioning how they work\nWell in that case I I don't know I mean the thing is all we have is a picture we haven't had the FBI or ATF for anybody with any sort of knowledge bail us out all the ... yeah talk about what that means what that is is that a remote control receivers that remote receiver that would detonate\nA when somebody sets it off to die and Ryan suits knows this kind of stuff well he described it as a kitchen time are basically in his retweet of the of the actual device it looked like it was a kitchen timer and then said you know his kitchen timer goes up to a hundred hours basically so if you set that thing\nDrop it in the mail and then count a hundred hours we don't know if the timer is going off a ... I mean if the count timers counting down on these devices right now that's what I Want to know well this is um this is going to dominate the show today we do have some of the things that we can talk about of course but we're going to make sure that we stay on this as more and more information comes in\nAgain the White House does say that the president is expected to make some remarks there was an event that's already planned\nA and when that happens will jump straight to the White House to get some information for the presidency what he has to say\nGary and Chan will continue after this\nPaul

all doing it\n\n[noise] well the the is definitely a part of the big story of the day these suspicious packages that have been mailed to different people different political figures throughout um the east coast we started just the other day with George Soros and a home that are ... lives in owns\nA that had a suspicious package with what appeared to be a pipe bomb in it and then you add the Clintons you had I'm\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz down in Florida you had John Brennan or at least ... a former CIA director John Brennan by way of the CNN headquarters in New York and Maxine Waters on Capitol Hill apparently was the recipient or at least the address the and of course uh the Obamas there in the DC area as well\nMark ... is standing by in Columbus Circle there at the time Warner center that was evacuated today when CNN got its own a pipe bomb mailed to mark what's going on\n[noise] yeah uh the investigation obviously continuing and the thing that we're waiting to hopefully get some more to an soon is is that the uh the not only was the ... there are a bomb or a device sent to CNN that evacuated the building but authorities did also say\nThat there was an auto loan with some white powder in it that they were doing some forensic testing on to essentially determine what that is and whether it's a threat of some kind of what we have\nA or heard in the last bit of a you know last several minutes was that the CNN has updated and said that time Warner center has reopened a that was evacuated or in the wake of\nThe the reception of this it's a device and and the device itself appeared to be a few inches long it looked like a a a pipe cylinder with some wires coming out of it connected to what appeared to be a timer and the whole thing was a wrap wrapped in a electrical tape so\nIt certainly appears to be a device and authorities have told us that ABC that\nThe six of these pipe bomb like devices are they believe that they were\nIntended to kill or maim whoever they were sent to\nThey described much hum in specifics about what it is I mean if it was a time or if it was a clock that was attached to this pipe if it was a if there was actual gunpowder inside of it yet\nI'm no but ... but judging by the fact that they say they intended or that they believe the intent of this device was these devices was to kill or main that would lead them to believe that these were\nCrew devices are meant to detonate they did not detonate but whether or not all the devices appeared the same or aware of the same construction\nHas yet to be determined uh do you know we know that these were sent to multiple people over in a couple of different states um one thing that we know that has apparently connected a lot of these devices or appears consistent is the on below the yellow on below that we have we've seen a picture of from the CNN\nHeadquarters or the CNN offices in New York appears consistent with\nThe ... that were used to send these devices to the Clinton household the Obama household\nAs well as a home of George Soros so we know that there are certainly appears to be some connection between those officials\nNot definitively saying that because it will take time for them to determine that so we don't know what the other devices look like specifically but we've seen this one we don't know whether or not that primary was you know truly a trigger or anything at this point but\nYou know the good news is none of these devices actually went off\nMark you mentioned this white powder and that was discovered along with the device ascent to CNN yeah long it takes to test the powder and in that vein when we're going to be briefed again by ... by the authorities on this\nWe haven't gotten an update on when may intend to uh provide some more information or things are just kinda trickling in as the day goes on at this point um uh but uh I don't know how long it would take them to do a forensic test on some of that white powder but\nJudging by the fact that time Warner center has reopened it would appear that they have either\nRented that safe or determine that it's not a threat because um CNN has said that the NYPD has concluded its security sweep and it's safe for people to return and and just a short time ago an hour or two ago when they were last providing it up there they said that they were still a you know closing off the mail room area and parts of the building as they were\nTrying to figure out what that powder is so uh we haven't got an update as to what it is or what they think it is and whether it's not a threat but a presumably they've at least made the situation safe because they're letting people back into time to Time Warner center\nWhat's it like that right now is our people and ... with a lot of us going on\nWell you know I'm actually just up the block or at the ABC headquarters now but when I left a you know it's amazing how things can return to normal quite quickly a New Yorkers today are going to see a lot of police around\nA lot of the counter counter terrorism of um sections of the NYPD or will be placed at strategic spots you'll probably see him in the subways and things like that and and but that's truly a part of\nLife in New York City you see police around every day but it was amazing because right down to the scene of Columbus Circle the traffic and the circle was still continuing to move despite literally ... uh catty corner over on a block or was completely closed off due to\nThan a century World Series on the radio on the\n[laughter] [noise]

this country as a president said earlier\nWe've um we've seen unfortunately for New York we've seen bomb attacks there before um it goes back I mean a hundred years I think Rockefeller's the of one of the Rockefeller's was the\nSubject of a bomb threat at one point so this is not unusual and I think part of it is just the fact that you know New York has Fifteen million people hanging around so you're going to get somebody in there who's crazy I'm ... but this you know this is not just New York because like you said there's a in Florida Debbie Wasserman Schultz office\nOr in Washington DC a

president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter that's far they've shown no comprehension of that\nYeah that that I Would say I mean as I'm as hearts and as I was with what the president did say at the White House I Want there to be some sort of an acknowledgement that is that what can be said about politicians you know the the words that you choose the tone you choose\nCan drive people nuts if that's the right way to put it or or like you said\nGive them a certain amount of\nA feeling that they're doing the right thing or maybe doing something that you want them to do well\nHere's the thing I mean the president is graded whipping up energy whipping up support for throwing the red meat to the bases they liked to say\nUm and he does this on line and does it on social media and he does go after individuals and I do think people are emboldened by seeing the president a go after specific people that they also do not\nLike but I also don't think that this is an indication of the way that people are feeling that that that there's a that we that we that we should think that\nThere are number of people willing to blow up the Clintons house in CNN's building because they're so angry you know what I mean I don't think it's indicative of of that\nYeah I also I mean I made a crazy person I made a point of saying I could easily find the tweets in which the president goes after each one of these individuals that were targeted in this whatever this plot appears to be but there's there's dozens of other people that the president has gone after that we are not targets of this same thing right\nExactly I mean he's he goes on if you're going to go out and listen people have gone after friday you're in any more paper was much younger less more pipe bombs on Fox News chief Kevin\nLord also put out a statement saying we condemn all attempted acts of violence against media organizations in our thoughts are with CNN for the safety of all their employees I mean it's one thing for us Charlie Hebdo to be the target of terrorists but in America when it's one of the tenants of this country for us to have a free press it\nIs more no I don't want to say more but it is um it hits it does hit pretty hard\nNothing wrong with seeing any more I mean the big because the point of\nAll I mean nobody is dead but just the thought that you

to work with ABC News for a very long time uh and has been involved with the FBI and the NYPD for some time\nMade it clear point of saying we are stepping up\nSecurity around the larger media outlets because there are so many of them based in New York City\nAnd that ...

the message\nChanges if that makes any sense it rhetoric is dial down yeah because it'd be campaign rallies or an opportunity for him to\nAh to whip up a whole room full of people and many times ten ten thousand Fifteen thousand people in one of these rooms and he personally enjoys doing that I mean you can see it if you watched any of the event on Monday Night\nOr he would go off script and the

stuff denied it and he would love it and keep going off the script I mean this and wipe away any good will or any positivity that he got from this statement at the White House today\nCNN chief Jeff Zucker is criticizing the White House or what he calls a total and complete lack of understanding about the seriousness\nOf attacks on the media or ... or tweeting that President Trump and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders a gym no comprehension not their words matter I think that's what people are waiting to hear\nWaiting to hear a somebody in the administration say listen I have gone off and personally attacked these people in the past but by you should not be emboldened to try and kill them I don't think you're going to get that this is not a president who likes to admit that he was wrong in any arena\nI don't think you're going to get that I think what you got was his best already today um some CNN or angry that that Sarah Sanders first statement on the explosive devices did not mention CNN is one of the targets although I tweet later by her did so\nUm CNN also upset about that fundraising letter that attack CNN we just told you about that that was sent out after the headquarters was evacuated\nThat but to ... that's a clerical snafu I mean that's just somebody forgetting that that was in the in the pipeline ready to come out I don't think that's a I I

happen\nHis campaign rallies by the way much like a Boston Red Sox game and Yankees suck a\nFrequently the rallies break out any chance of CNN sucks\nCNN socks they they they chant lock her up right I mean listen I did this earlier since June\n... every one of the targets of these these potential devices has been mentioned by the president in a tweet every single one of them\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz June seventh Maxine Waters June twenty fifth John Brennan August Eighteenth Eric Holder September eleventh and George Soros October fifth every single one of them has been attacked at one point by the president now the president has I think\nA responsibility to come out and say listen you know what I say on Twitter is said in you know in good fun in uh I'm doing it as a way of expressing my opinion about things but never wants to have I called for vi\n[laughter] imagine when you put your child to sleep every night that they could die if they're not connected\nTailings against somebody at a dinner or I should say that he's never called for violence against these people and I think that that's an important thing that somebody at the White House needs to recognize is a topic that should be addressed that being said\nHe did it I thought he did a great job today I mean in terms of what he said for his two minutes they're speaking about what he said that's exactly what he needed to say\nNow he can double down as we get a little bit deeper to the investigation if we find somebody that's uh that claims to be a supporter of his he's got to come out and say this is not the way we act this is not the way we behave\nDo we see a more respectful and more civil President Trump moving forward do we don't see somebody who who lays off that the third grade nicknames no
