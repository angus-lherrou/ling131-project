you're up all night they sleep all day and it really fast on healthy thing to do but it seems like a lot of fun at the time but I'm kind of like junior we make to fix it you\nKnow [noise]\n\n\nA little bit more\nAnd vote on John John did okay I joined Thomas I handle here in the morning and it's the last segment we do I mean today we're really going politics because there's so much going on\nAnd handled breaking in real so little information for you yeah he's the USC is announced today it's reached in principle a two hundred and Fifteen dollar ... an joined and fifty million dollar class action settlement and I'm getting a little bit more information now according to the LA Times they are saying now\nThat this will go to twenty five hundred dollars to every student who ever saw tend to let the campus and chew hundred fifty thousand dollars to students who allege that they were abused by hand however\nThe proposed settlement covers a federal class action lawsuit but he does not resolve hundreds of planes made in state court\nWow so this is just was pay off your student loans are here you go and then the case will go does this break guess see I mean well and dirty habit yeah several billion dollars yeah\nYeah let's just say that I I think\nThey're going to look back at this to a you know I Do crisis management right on the uh the watching this closely I think\nThey're going to look back and they're going to say if this only cost us two hundred and fifty million dollars to save our reputation we got off cheap probably yeah that makes sense because this whole thing is not handled properly from a PR management could take down the university at spirit are taken out of college president significant at\nThe university I mean but I I'm assuming the Larry Nassar gymnast\nAt Larry Nassar gymnastics center is\nA no longer going to have that name they probably shifted the phone yeah sure they did All right back when he goes we finished shop or the Thomas Guy who John Thomas before a Gary and Shannon come aboard and it's not going to be arraigned Shannon\nIs going to be ... and ... and their act out there in Huntington Beach right now All right Pocahontas or the takeaway here\nWell besides all the funding means we're floating around all week which were just nice slap or is\nThis was strategically done a ... lives with Warren was essentially made the calculation she is running for president uh most experts believe that she's probably the was the favorite\nTo get through of a primary cycle and challenge Trump\nThis Pocahontas thing as we laugh about a joke about it is funny but [noise]\nIt is a huge vulnerability in two ways it's a huge phone ability in a general election against Trump because uh he's going to name ... yeah Trump will beat that drum um and so she needed to just rip it off like a band aid and get it done\nAnd it was a big deal in a primary because\nFor different reasons than it is to Republicans or a general electorate in a sense of she's Clinton she by exploiting her\nPoint oh nine percent Native American heritage which apparently what an average northern a northern European have had more than that but um but what it meant was that she exploited her race or or the race card\nAnd took a spot at Harvard that could have\nBeen awarded to another minority who actually deserved it so that ... that you better believe that the primary team will exploit\nThat so uh my question is uh is this going to be her email I Do\nI Do I mean was it was a botched rollout and the reason they chose to do it this week I I saw in press reports is like oh how selfish of Elizabeth Warren why didn't she focused on taking back the house and then do it\nWell she didn't now smartly because she was hoping that it would be a one day to day story and then we were then back to the mid term conversation we forgot all about it and then after them in terms of the day after when she rolls at her campaign for twenty twenty and she's asked about you can go that's old news everybody rose I'm confirmed\nTo be part Native American okay so in hindsight twenty twenty hindsight a because she had the DNA results and it showed such a miniscule amount of a Native American blood on who decided they're going to go forward that anyway\nThey were kind of damned if they did they damned if they didn't hear because if if she didn't release or DNA reports\nThen you can beat the drum about what are you hiding you know you're not a Native American and now she's lying and but if she was able to point towards some miniscule thing that says that she is she can maybe fight that argument and put her behind but now she didn't anticipate that people would\nGo and say oh my God I think it's because the number she initially gave to the Washington Post sounded a lot better and then the Washington Post re did the math a couple of hours later and updated the story and said oh it was actually one one thousand and twenty four percent I don't think she anticipated\nHow bad it would be looked at this spell her undoing I'm not sure that it does\nBut it definitely is one of those things where she now you've got a punch line and there's nothing you can do about\nIt now the question is of course among from a followers it doesn't matter what she does I mean she could literally becoming a coming in as Pocahontas and prove a hundred percent but she is like Pocahontas reincarnated or so that part of not worried about\nIs there enough there where the electorate is going to say you know what you're right but there's not an email issue where security of the United states is at stake and well\nNow here's what's worse is this just shown that she's not pure she's not trustworthy that she's in it for its herself and that's that's part of what that was the dean on Hillary Clinton is the Clintons are self interested that the the people who smiled the most about this Pocahontas thing was not Donald Trump it was\nCory Booker it was comical Harris calmly just thought hey you know what my lane just got a little bit wider as we get through this primary thing and bill is going to be exciting is the day after we get through the mid term elections all these guys on the Democratic side are going to be announcing their campaigns and there are nearly pretty\nCrazy thirty candidates got to be granted it at All right so ah the Thomas Guide and you can on all social media of course the Thomas Guide also the poll a every week and now in your strategy and the results are are on the website on\nA well it's on yeah care if I Am six forty dot com or you can find me a political on the weekend\nA true All right uh wow what a day it's been coming up Jane Wells and you'll ... or some ... some odd or a good for you build a gene well you know you made around very fans I Know I did filling in for Gary and Shannon today there the H U gastro pub in Huntington Beach\nUh right across from the great Pacific Air show in tomorrow I'll be there and we'll have a really rip roaring good time All right Thanks John as always we'll talk again next week and in the meantime\nI'll probably see you once or twice or three times\nThe liberal state um but there's two things are changing\nTheir very much changing even though the New York times this particular district still has has more registered Republicans and Democrats by ten points in orange county their power has been falling or used to be registered Republicans were more than half their now down to a third\nAnd another thirty percent here are not affiliated with either party and I think that's very much what you're saying across California and the country is people who don't want to be affiliated with either and those voters are the ones you have to go out and it and those voters will be the ones perhaps that make the difference uh on election day although\nYou know it's all about getting your base riled up a can Trump get Republicans out can Democrats are angry over what happened with the Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh hearings get their base out I'm really\nIs a former registered Republican who's now running as a Democrat he's a bit he's not your typical California Democrat\nSnow and who's the [noise] the ads play that\nWay yeah there is a little confusing where you're like whoa what are you the guy\nWho is not a Russian Five I think is basically what his advice level that's good right we don't want Russians fly we agree on that\nHe has raised a I think twice as much I think he has raised maybe more than twice as much as ... has so far and he has spent three times as much and he still has a more plenty of money on hand\nSo I get ready for all the ads going for the next two and a half weeks which are good for radio stations and TV oh yeah but they make me crazy\nYou know what's funny is we get we'll get letters emails from people and tweets are angry social media saying why are you playing this in Italy\nYou don't you don't like shut out\nYou can't you can't even legally shut out the assumption is you know 'cause you'll hear a you know pro a prop six you'll hear against ... and the goal why don't why do you put props anti prop six on when you've got John McCain on one side saying how great it is\nYou can't you can't just say hey we don't like your as\nA ... and also here's a newsflash uh the radio and television industry is our business and the way the station stay on the air is through advertising dollars and that's why this time of year is just a windfall because you I suppose you can raise your rates right I mean there's so much competition to buy time\nWhile they're actually there's there's legality\nTied into it where it has to be a certain right all the political ads are always at a certain rate and you can't say no to political or wait you get to charge do you have to charge less than you would for a solar panel thing or whatever the windows are the I'm not sure what the exact uh specifications are but there is a set\nThis was only ... ad ad time and political seasons or ... or you just don't have those ... yeah you don't have to do any make goods obviously because you're just fully booked with and they never see how the the assumption is station has a bent\nStation hosts ever been ration as a whole does well yeah I don't\nI mean with your FCC licensed can you wouldn't matter I don't know whether there's no way to run a station like\nThis but what's interesting too is that Democrats not just in this district but in several districts in California and across the country are pouring money in a\nOutspending him a Republicans there are a potentially six GOP congressional seats up for grabs in strongholds here in California in this election and so it's all about getting the based out traditionally\nAre in the midterm elections Democrats don't come out in force the way Republicans do but after Brett Kavanaugh can you get enough\nAnger going I mean certainly the president is out there every time every day every day although I don't think I don't I haven't heard him a stumping for Dana Rohrabacher by the way\nOr has a new Rohrabacher I have always sometimes they pulled his like spell Rohrabacher\nHe has a new ad out which shows that even I don't I don't assume he voted for Obamacare but he's pushing the fact that hey I'm like you I'm all for keeping a coverage for pre existing conditions because my daughter had leukemia\nSo that's a new tactic a campaign tactic for him like I'm going to fight for you he was on a bus trip with some seniors trying to go to a medical marijuana dispensary the other day that CNBC was following along he showed up for that was was\nHe going for the marijuana or was it was it a political satire\nI assume it was a political situation but he hasn't made the same kind of traditional\nReached that he would have before when his seat was safe I Would have\nTold you I got to match that he's very aware that you see is\nA teetering shall we say\nOh well if you believe polls he's neck and neck with Harley ... I'm I'm going to catch up with ... next week is I prepare to cover elections stories for CNBC we're going to have\nUh politics throughout the show next we're going to talk about Disneyland next door in Anaheim and later we will talk to uh the mayor Huntington Beach oh we're going to have the director of the ... the great Pacific Air show here to talk about that\nIt is beautiful come down and joined us here at the age you gastro pub in Huntington Beach just to come down to the air show it starts at Lehman three there's perfect\nPerfect day for watching all this acrobatic flying for watching Gary Hoffman throw up on himself with the thunderbirds\nKillers each to write their overlooking you can see everything while you're drinking and ... unbelievable\nThe early they gave back hundreds of millions of dollars and subsidies all these things all these things which make it a parrot that they're trying to be exempt even though they did raise their wages to Fifteen dollars starting in January they don't want to be forced to go up to Eighteen and so they're saying you know\nWe may be the largest employer in Anaheim our tax revenues may provide half\nThese animal budget but if you're going to try and tell us how to pay our employees um\nWe're out we're going to respond with a yeah with the the mouse that the the mouse that roared yes there's Peter Sellars fans everywhere excited by that reference lots\nOf interesting political stuff happening here in orange county I just think it's the most interesting place in the state this election season right now because\nThere may be some changes we have to see when we come back though we're going to speak to the brand new director for the great Pacific Air show it's the first time they brought in a local directors the third time they've had the air show he's brought a lot of changes to it\nIt has a tremendous economic value to Huntington Beach come on down here and joined us at the age to gastro pub come watch the air show Jane Wells and ... filling in for Gary and Shannon calf I Am six forty and I think it's a me with the new get is Amy with a new USC\nIs announcing universities agreed in principle to two hundred and fifty million dollar class action settlement that will compensate students who claim they were sexually abused during Danica logical exams by Dr George Kendall\nEach of the former patients will get twenty five hundred dollars and the settlement patients willing to provide more details about their experiences\nCould be eligible for additional compensation up to a quarter million dollars news brought to you by Fletcher Jones motor cars red flag warnings are sent to last all day and into tonight across so Cal forecasters are predicting when gas up to forty five miles per hour in some areas\nHumidity will also dip into the low teens air should become a bit less dry headed into the weekend\nMan from can add a candidate accused of stocking reality star Kendall gender has been arrested a day after he was released\nDMZ is reporting John Ford was arrested and taken in for a psych evaluation Tuesday when he showed up on ... porch and the Hollywood Hills he was deemed it mentally stable and let go the next day he was arrested yesterday for allegedly trespassing and violating a restraining order\nDoctors say the sheriff's deputy shot in Adelanto will likely survive San Bernardino county sheriff's deputy Robert John was shot in the stomach yesterday morning Sheriff John McMahon says the deputy at her shots at an apartment complex\nWhen they approach the apartment to further investigate is when gunfire erupted from inside the apartment and ultimately struck deputy dropped\nThe deputy was in critical stable condition by the afternoon to men from LA have been arrested and the A.

at the age to gas Republican Huntington Beach right across the street from the ocean where the great Pacific Air shows kicked off today in third or just look at it I mean if you want to watch them crazy fun flying the weather is absolutely perfect for it today I Know last year\nThere was a some issues with the weather on the first day but man it's gorgeous today\nIt is joining us is the brand new director for the air show is Kevin Kevin welcome thanks for thanks for dropping by well thanks\nFor having me on I really appreciate and thanks for being here uh where are you from I Am from Huntington Beach born and raised some local boy\nYou very much thanks very much lucky local by this is a great place to grow up you know I've been all over the world they do events all over the country and I always come home to Huntington Beach and and uh it's home for me the best weather that anybody has anywhere period so why did they bring you on why did they bring on a local director all I think the ah you know Huntington Beach is all about supporting\nOur local businesses and our local community and I think the the dream was to be able to bring this home to a local ownership group that would find pride in the community and try to do outreach to our local community and businesses and try to deliver a economic impact not only for our city but also for our region and do it in a way that's meaningful and conscientious and hopefully I can\nCarry that torch forward what are you doing differently than has been done and what are your plans for the show well our vision for the show is to make it the largest outdoor of lifestyle festival that happens or anywhere just biting off small\nYou know I think that that's our big our big vision right and I think right now we are sure hunger and bring peace to all the right why not one of our added we could throw that in how did you have to prepare the event for the people are going to witness all weekend long well we we got started a little late this year we had about a little over a hundred\nDays to put the entire events together this year but the good news is is we have a longer runway now with our agreement with the city and uh you know we get started we're already started planning twenty twenty so the shows are only going to get better we're certainly uh I think a much better than we were last year and we're going to continue to get better and better\nMore flying this year longer flying how many people do you expect give us an idea\nWell I think you know the the numbers are we're we'll see I mean I think the weather so definitely not hurting our our case or this year but I think we'll probably have a few million gas down here uh throughout the weekend wow\nLast year remember friday was a little rough I just came from the performer briefing and they briefed up on the weather we had a no representative there that told us we're going to have eighty five and sunny the entire weekend so it's going to be incredible in fact they said they apologize they said we wish it had been eighty two but unfortunately it's\nGoing to be welcome to soak out how many pilots what was the blitz violence when you were they all in there the all the while\nYes every single pilots in the room we do it in the council chambers here as well and it's absolutely electric those guys are so totally excited to bring a their passion you know the the air show business as a as a business that's relied largely upon passion right these are aviation guys\nAnd they are here to extend that passion to the everyday a spectator who maybe doesn't\nIsn't been inspired to become an astronaut or an engineer or a pilot or anything like that\nThat's what they're passionate about and they're going to do their routines and they're going to push themselves to the limit and it's going to be all for our benefit\nWhat's the coolest thing we're going to see this weekend oh that's a that's a good one I mean we're going to see a couple of cool things I think probably the the Seventeen or which is the largest transport aircraft\nAnd uh we're going to have a um I'm being doing they're going to do a simulated air to air refueling with Casey one thirty five strata of tanker and so we'll see them both flying ... by a and there'll be information will have the boom down they weren't actually be transferring fuel but there'll be simulating like as if they were transferred all air to air\n... if that is a weird thing to look at 'cause it looked like a strange mating rituals we've\nEver being lowered and writing because I think that gives us\nMore insight to you than you might get I Would say I was talking about Neal is a little weird to see that daily\nThing you know and then somehow it attaches yeah and then it's like there for a long time right and then\nThose planes are in love and then you're Seventeen opens up yeah exactly yeah yeah well I'm Sorry no\nThat's great real getting us there we also have a another performer Jeff a bourbon who you're making a is Southern California debut in his new play in a ... one ten so what do you I was talking to Jeff yesterday and he told me I said how did you come up with the idea for this he said I saw two fifty five sitting on the ramp and as I was looking down it hit me\nI could take these two planes take your wings often attach them together and make one plane out of it so you have one aircraft with two fuselage is right was that two engines\nAnd uh you know it looks really cool and then he thought just for good measure hail just strap a jet engine down the center of it so\nHe can actually take that thing Senate doughnuts and hit the jet engine and just accelerate straight up the plane was about four thousand pounds on this whole\nUh for us to make about eight thousand oh my goodness so he'll he'll line up right out here and do his then vertical crime yeah and you'll hear the jet engine fire off just as a really cool guy and we're really excited to how do you watch that too like who does he walk up to and\nGo you see the flames want to take the wings off I Want to meet them together I mean who do that's basically what I asked and he goes yeah actually it was pretty easy\nAnd why I always look look I worked for CNBC I'm always all about the money can you give me some idea of what it cost to put this on and I'm thinking the insurance has the astronomical because you're dealing with some pretty incredible flying on and the machines yeah and then\nWell they are coming in for hearing Shannon how we are happy aged gas your father Huntington Beach right across the street from the great Pacific Air show which can often lead at thirty Gary Hoffman sharing\nValley told us he's running down the runway right now does that mean he's running away from\nUs how I picture it I'd figure in going after this I'm done get it out yeah that is\nLocked up in the air okay he is I I Will stay with that I found it very one of the air force not embrace that guy\nBrandon\nSilk or major brand new health care is going to make 'em Gary vomit let's hope on his pressures to\nBe talking about your pressure not to make a bomb it is a beach Mayor Mike ... who joined says hey how's that for ... thank you I went through my segue as a kid [laughter]\nHey Mary how are ya I'm awesome\nThis is going to be a great weekend great bumper music very appropriate music is great that the official music of Huntington Beach at least in my opinion\nSo we're looking forward to a great weekend or as Kevin Elliott said we're hoping to see maybe two million visitors here we had a million last year in the air before um we've got ethic whether\nYou do you know last year we had fog on friday and little cool on Saturday but or to be eighty five degrees and sunny and you can see all the way to Catalina and even at the purity concede saying come on the island it's going to be spectacular for doing the show\nWhat is the economic benefit to the city\nOf economic benefit you know it's funny you mention that I spoke about that last night it was we had a a a very high level of economic\nLook into it after the show last year and we believe that the minimum a net to the city is three hundred four hundred thousand dollar range but I expect that it's actually much greater than that so we did we didn't hire consulting we just sort of did some\nAnecdotal data that we extrapolated from a visa credit card sales and from that we may be estimated cash sales MasterCard sales other credit card sales\nAnd uh and then of course the parking you know we charge or thirty dollars for all day for parking normally it's Fifteen the overage of the Fifteen dollars spread and then the extra filling in the parking we use to offset the public safety costs right\nRight there's a lot of the key I posed for officers there's\nThere is there is we have all hands on deck with the with the police and the firing the lifeguards and of course we also have some support from the Orange County sheriff's department and uh but it's a family event we had no real trouble the last two years and expecting any trouble this you're either a ... the garden variety of\nThe level of fight over I mean when you're not allowed in plain meanwhile the usual James had too much\nLike I'm not\nI'm not looking at you ladies alone I think you're right I think you're on that list Jane guy for that really that flash back right at the local economy I mean it costs the cost of living especially\nIn places like this astronomical are unemployment though is that a record low in this state one of them maybe tax revenues are up although there was a tax cut for businesses to net net what what's the revenue situation looking for places like that\nWe're looking pretty good we actually balance the budget every single year we'd balance the budget again this year we do have some challenges with the pensions or the pension discount rate was reduced what that meant is that employers like the city of Huntington Beach pays more an employer contributions\nSo that was a pretty significant hit force in two thousand Nineteen in fact it's a five million dollar hit on our two hundred and thirty million dollar discretionary budget so we're looking at a couple of I brought actually three measures I'm so glad you asked that she and I was talking about public\nPolicy audiences on the edge of their seat okay I was talking about her shows oh ...\nYeah we're all just make it real quick one since we're working on bringing money back from Sacramento\nOh ... well you better start getting Gavin Newsom number although you never know what's going to happen a John Cox you probably have less like I don't like when I guy\nI just hope that they're both fair for asking for certain\nNext like getting a vision of going\nI'm support I'm supporting John Cox I'll say that I've actually looked like a probably about four times and the more than four times we've been talking about the pension issue and and his ability to actually to a point to a new board members to the to the ... board\nAnd uh uh that's step one so that was one become mayor of Huntington Beach or through serendipity I mean that's a that's really is as simple as I can make a move to Huntington Beach over Twenty years ago lived on bought a house on main street for main street watch the parade every single year wow\nAnd from that that got me interested in serving the city or one of my good friends ran and was elected the city council became mayor his name is Joe ... show he pointed me to the fourth of July executive board and that was part of the organizing committee\nA in two thousand six and seven and raise money and then that a stimulated interest and other things uh\nAnd then he asked me to be on the planning commission back in two thousand Thirteen and the thing about he knows you know planning commission it's typically the solid training ground for city council and a and I got on that and after about a year or some\nPeople asked me to think about running in a quick story Travis Allen who's are some women at the time we had a fundraiser our house and and I asked him if you know what he thought about me running for city council\nJust alternate stuck him so he tells everybody there was like sixty people in the room and he says hey we're thinking what do you think about those you running for city council goes yeah yeah yeah I said okay so ... was part of the responsibility pushing me in the\nPool I have to ask you since we're in the forty a congressional district is Dana Rohrabacher going to win\nI think so I mean they Dana Rohrabacher is strong I came out and supported him very early on a I've been supporting him ever since I've been actually supporting him before I was even a\nCity council I Know he's a probably got maybe the toughest race in history but I firmly believe he's going to win\nDo you does this Russia\nA romance he seems to have with food and does that concern you at all\nYou know what I'm concerned about is is and I ... I spoke about this I was interviewed on a new uh for a newspaper about a month ago and what I'm concerned about what within Roebuck and our congressional representative is helping us\nAddress the issues of our city and he's got a ... or fifty seven twenty four that will help us address the proliferation of the silver living homes issue and\nAnd I were working with a congressman or buck or two to help bring the next generation aerospace jobs we spoke about aerospace before we went on the air and the next generation of aerospace jobs as commercial rocket\nCommercial rocketry I'm not even sure if that's the right word for I think it is but we have we have some commercial rocket manufacturers here are like rocket labs are they actually launched from New Zealand but they build rockets fear a mission critical components of bills components for those here\nUh we've got the Boeing campus just sold thirty one acres or too serious Regis and that's going to be maybe five hundred thousand or so square feet of\nIndustrial spaces zone for research and technology so we're hoping that we can attract and the developers can attract that next generation of manufacturers\nThere'll be building the next generation of aerospace which\nReal you can have kind of a whole space here again all the way up to ... down here I stand in bird I can see it when both our dad's worked in the day that would be very exciting alright I make my county thanks for stopping by\nMy pleasure thank you for having us come down to the show is free\nWeight was freaky\nFree I Want to remind me that all weekend long you get a chance to win a thousand dollars you know you hear that throughout the week\nHere on KFI but well we're moving it into the weekends as well to listen to your favorite weekend shows on Saturday and Sunday and for your chance to win a thousand dollars and when we come back in the next hour we are going to be discussing\nHot later in the hour a candidate versus us and uh one local candidates CEO has written a letter to the president saying don't let Canada destroy this\nBudding industries in the hour as well ... if I Am six forty Gary's up in the air right now we'll hear from him later and here's the new\nPaul Harvey\n... are you\nKidding me that kind of joy and your life when a thousand dollars on fire next shot happens within twenty minutes hey Angela in orange county and I already\nWhen thinking I'm ... now I should ask that\nWouldn't throw up that I could just tell by looking at you that you would totally pulled I. G. while you're taxing it taking so they don't do the weight measurements are not no not into that and even get it is it pretty\nCool job working here in Huntington Beach we get fantastic whether we get fantastic assignments we get to do things like just constantly all throughout the summer\nNow with the combination of the show so it's a it's a pretty cool I always\nWonder this maybe on cultural question when you work in such a nice and wealthy city do you get more attitude from people like you know like uh\nDo you know who I Am not in the least we I worked in an agency that was I'm not as fun as Huntington Beach before and I can't tell you how kind and receptive the residents of Huntington Beach are it's fantastic it's like a different world\nWhat if people need to know uh when they're coming out here this week so they don't end up in handcuffs\n[laughter] um the number one thing not necessarily for handguns but you have patients because there are going to be a ... huge number of people down here the influx of people that are coming to the beach in coming toward the alone\nIs going to be tough so have patients when your parking patients when you're going anywhere um to stay out of hand cuts you absolutely one of the things as you want to have 'em be calm\nAnd bring alcohol down to the beach that's a big one so there's no alcohol allowed on our beaches so if you're going to be down on the beach and then maybe even going into our downtown area or Pacific city to happen afterwards just before that's all we ask\n... or ... or the VIP experienced is their alcohol
