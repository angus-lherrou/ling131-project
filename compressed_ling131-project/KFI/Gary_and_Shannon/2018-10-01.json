{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "[noise] [laughter]\n\nHi handle here and a good morning [noise] it is a a Monday first Monday in October spring court judge today begins at fashion uh also taught for any news course Jeff uh ... uh well not Jeff Flake a although he was part of what happened during the Kavanaugh hearings\nA break Kavanaugh's having his investigation this week with the FBI\nAnd also up on Instagram a news that we didn't get too there's always a story or two that we didn't get to an end on the news and for some reason there was always great stories and coming up at ten o'clock it's handle on the law off the air eight seven seven five to zero eleven fifty now more\nAnd we finish with a do you do they have a case\nLike this is a great story about a great guitar it's a Martin D thirty five guitar that Elvis Presley played during his final tour in Nineteen Seventy seven and one night he was playing in St Petersburg Florida and he dropped it\nAnd it was not ruined but there was a little damage and or the king being the king he dropped it and he went well and he gave it to somebody in the Audi now\nLater that person sold it to a to a memorabilia broker named Robert Johnson he bought that guitar in two thousand seven right after that another guy he's really into collecting rock and roll memorabilia\nLarry mosh\nEntered into a deal to buy that guitar plus some other guitars from Robert Johnson now Robert Johnson started acting a little bit weird though guitar at the time was in a museum and he said we're going to keep it in the museum for a certain amount of time and then when it's done there you know I'll give you the guitar\nOne day the other guy Larry must he goes to the museum and the guitars not there anymore even though we're still supposed to be on display then he sees that it's being offered online at an auction he calls the auction house and he says that's my guitar I already made a deal with this guy it ends up this guitar\nAdded different museum who got it from Robert Johnson who had already agreed to sell it to ...\nBut the museum did not know anything about any of this as you might imagine and so\nMr mom shoes the museum hey you've got that guitar that's my guitar I had a previous deal with this guy goes to court he's suing the museum he's not suing Robert Johnson who I think it's pretty clear\nThey ... him over that he sold to detach pretty clear Robert Johnson messed him over but he's suing the museum who got the guitar under circumstances where they didn't know anything was going on\nWhat do you think the appeals court does in a case like this who who's guitar is it yeah well I ... I have a couple of questions I don't know if the case a reverse of that and that is the deal with the museum that first museum was there a time certain that the museum was going to hold that guitar\nAnd yeah I mean yes okay the first museum uh which uh was I forget where it was it was in Nashville yeah there was like because Robert Johnson didn't give the guitar to that museum he loaned it outright be exhibited first a set period of time\nThat's why when Mr mosque bought it he knew he'd have to wait right exactly except the guitar\nAll right so the second museum but does it go only guitar does he think do they think it was donated to them\nThey got the guitar in what they call a purchase donation deal which worked this way this is actually interesting the museum agreed to pay Johnson two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a good part of the John and whistle from those who had owned\nAnd as part of the deal Johnson agrees to give them as a donation di Elvis Presley guitar got it\nOkay well [noise] museums going to lose a because\nAh the museum or they can argue there are a bona fide purchaser a recipient of a charity but ah the owner of the good car loans to Qatar for a set amount of time right before selling it to us right he said uh\nWell he had already ... you're right or he said you have to wait ... he'll exactly um so the question is the second museum was it in the same time line it was years later oh Minnesota but it's not the timeline let me tell you one other thing that's important the museum of saying\nListen you moss you never actually took possession of that guitar\nOh because that could talk that Qatar was in the museum you made the deal for later delivery and one of the legal questions is when do you take ownership of something when you make the deal for it or when you actually receive it\nOr you take you take ownership when the deal is made when title is transferred or whether it's a physical title like in real estate\nAll or when you take possession same thing with a with a house if I sell you a house and title changes doesn't matter when you actually take possession of the house you can wait two years you ... you can make a deal with me to rented\nThe museums gonna lose no question about it in my case oh come on tell me why didn't\nThey didn't want that to me they\nThis is the craziest thing because after pointing out that under Tennessee law\nOr where delivery is made without moving the item which was the case here basically I'm giving it to you but it's staying over here for a while normally that's when title passes but in this case because it was in federal court\nThe federal court said no as far as we're concerned\nMr moss never took title of the good part because he never took possession of the guitar that's in ... Elvis Presley so that has sanity so there can never be a real estate deal unless you take possession of the day you close you have to physically move in and take possession of the property or that piece of paper\nTitle itself means nothing much that's crazy it is kind of a weird that series but I think part of it is the fed saying we don't care about tendencies last maybe but that's still crazy makes no sense All right\nJerry yes or what's going on in your work oh well we're finally off our suspension for saying baloney meter so we're back at it today um all of the Kavanaugh stuff\nThat you didn't hear that whole story okay uh the the Kavanaugh stuffed the president just held a news conference all about NAFTA and then you ... what what'd you called the ... yeah ...\nWhatever the new agreement in use magma use them or whatever it is whatever it is yeah he was asking if he was taking questions about trade and people kept trying to ask him about judge Kavanaugh and uh he finally relented and started answering some questions we have some absolute\nGolden nugget from that news comes of course you do All right uh going on and I'm enjoying your Dodgers play this afternoon I play

the last time I went to a Dodgers game was with me with you before that\nIt was Nineteen eighty one oh no no no oh yeah it was for Nader and our values ripe and before that so I've gone to exactly

Trump has announced a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico\nWe have successfully completed negotiations on a brand new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA\nThe agreement reached late yesterday give us farmers greater access to the Canadian dairy market it offers Canada protection if Trump goes ahead with plans to impose tariffs on trucks cars and auto parts imported into the U.S Mexico says the deal provide certainty for financial markets investment and job creation\nIntense and bring up all of that because that is actually more troubling to me as a Supreme Court justice then what happened in Nineteen eighty two I mean I'm I'm it's terrible what happens if that's what he did I I obviously she was\nAssaulted by somebody do you mean they would make a political yes yeah\nIt was more troubling his attitude his ... his entitlement that bothered me a lot more I think he was exposed as a person we don't see Supreme Court justices as people\nAnd we saw him as a person who he is and he is just somebody who does not want to be called to the mat for anything he's ever done and he was just so ... and still upset that he had to answer those questions\nI didn't see I didn't get that I I could see how that how you could see that I don't know if it's just a male female difference in that I think it's I Know there's plenty of I mean there's plenty of dudes who think he's a total leaders\nThen it's not your weekend with a bunch of white guys in the Central Valley I spent mind with a bunch of lesbians in Portland so I had a feeling we'd\nCome to school with a ... area of opinion different echo chambers that you're not really we really are but the one thing that I thought\nHe missed an opportunity to do and I I\nI've never been I've never had to testify for hours in front of a Senate committee so I also see how ... you know later in the day Dr Ford was\nShe was slipping like she couldn't keep she couldn't concentrate on the question that she couldn't quite under ... so they're getting ... percent very fragile arson and she was hopped up on caffeine and\nThere's I mean she's reliving what she believes I mean what was the the a ... life changing moment for her and she's doing it in front of God and everybody right\nFor him came late in the day the moment that I came late in the day was when Cory Booker started asking them questions and the the senator from New Jersey was asking do you believe that she ... being Dr Ford do you believe that she was a democratic operative\nAnd I thought that that judge Kaplan I missed the opportunity to say no no no no hold on\nI I feel horrible for what Dr Ford has gone through whether she thinks I did it or somebody else did I feel horrible because obviously she's impacted to this day thirty six years later\nI blame everybody on that side and he said it a couple of times but he says I blame everybody on your side of this you know of this room and I blame Senator Feinstein specifically because\nShe had the information months ago when this information could have come out could have remained confidential because the FBI would have honored to confidentiality it was the ranking member\nWho allow this information to get out somehow and and and to not make it so much about Dr Ford and and that would also take away the political thing about you know the theories of the Clintons into BS in that\nRight and I also think he missed an opportunity to say bring on the FBI investigations yeah hip tote around that question repeatedly why I don't know why I that was another thing why unless you have something to hide\nI assume it was just because it they that Republicans or the White House specifically didn't want to give\nThat step but\nI mean I I got to tell you everybody in the middle that I Know everybody who's like well she has a credible story but he has a credible defense\nOr there's no one who corroborate her story in that moment but there are people who said judge Kavanaugh was never there that this thing never happened this party that she describes so she didn't have the corroborate of evidence they would have been necessary to make it even more credible why not just open it up let the FBI do their question right\nBe a president this morning was asked about this and it was a press conference to behold I mean he went totally off by\nOff script off the rails and we will all benefit from it when we come\nBack ... before we do that we also have a thousand dollars\nYour shot at one thousand dollars and now the key word thing to two hundred two hundred you'll get

it's it's pretty amazing that you could go a hundred and sixty two games and still end up completely tied I Know a but it's great this is so this is all the teams that\nAre playing today are still in um they just have to\nFigure out who's going to win the division who's going to go on and play for the wild card as well so we'll keep an eye on that game there's no score and the cubs a brewers games morning\nSo the president told a news conference this morning all about the new NAFTA deal which is not called NAFTA anymore\nI think he just I think he was probably ... satisfied with just a name change it's like a ... he was doing All right\nUm yeah the deadline was late last night and everybody came to the table finally we figured out exactly what's ah what's going to go into this and allow some concessions for for example uh our dairy farmers to have more uh more reach into the Canadian market a bunch of other stuff as well and I don't understand to be on it\nBut um when he was out in front of the White House today or behind the White House and answering questions reporters on trade once people started\nChime in with questions about Brett Kavanaugh yeah and he kept saying well get to those I'm doing just trade questions Caitlin Collins is a reporter for CNN who at one point said I'm going to ask a question on judge Kavanaugh and he wasn't ready for it yet and told her weight no you don't you know\nExcuse me if you use me she's like in the middle of our question excuse me that's what he does to shut people up and he ends\nUp asking the question he completely ignores it moves on to somebody else in answer to ... a a trade question so he did get back to it and did start answering questions about judge cabin and it was a doozy all boy um let's see I Want to start with a vis when this was the first comment that he made about a\nKnowing some people if drinking was the issue he knows some people who are pretty sloppy drunks\nWhen you know I tell you what I happen to know some United States senators one who is on the other side\nWho's pretty aggressive I've seen that person in very bad situations [laughter] okay [laughter] I've seen that person in very very bad\nSituation worse when someone compromising and you know uh I think it's very unfair to to bring up things like this however what ever the senators want is okay with me\nThat is so wrong [laughter] thoroughly somebody under the bus or a few minutes later one of the other reporters Mr\nPresident you just had some senators are not angels and you've seen some of them and they some of them yeah compromising situation this could you tell us who and exactly what I Know no\nI think I'll save it for a book like everybody else in Iraq [noise] black guy giving it to you\nThat was good it was a great line um but when he talked about I'm Caitlin calls did eventually get the question to ask and it was about alcohol and the use of alcohol because if you have loving to and\nUh is right he's the guy who was at Yale with Brett Kavanaugh on said Brett Kavanaugh lied to everybody on Thursday when he talked about\nThe quantity of his drinking while at school\nIf that becomes an issue and if that's something where you can talk about the the judge perjured himself in front of Congress I don't know that'd be really hard to prove when you're talking about quantities of drinking and how much that guy considers too much and how much Brett Kavanaugh considers to\nModel and then you're putting alcohol abuse on trial or alcohol you suggest al ... right it can you like beer and\nBe a Supreme

Milwaukee up over the cubs won nothing in the bottom of the third for that play off and then we've got a playoff coming to\nStadium when the Rockies\nBeyond the Dodgers Walker buell or with the start for the Dodgers\nDogs that are ... ah I Love that it's gotten\nDoing I really wanted to get back at al division twenty eight teams T shirt I think it depends on who I don't think the Dodgers want to

[noise] so you have to be nice to her\nAll months I'm not a bad person I like beer [laughter]\nUm\nYeah so this is a ah just going to be a huge game today although I mean they're in the playoffs there in the post season we know that the question is do they go from this playoff game this yeah this playoff game is tied breaker game today to the division series\nOr do they go to another one game must win to continue which would happen tomorrow\nI think the scores yesterday were insane you're pointing out\nRockies beat Washington at Coors Field twelve to nothing yeah uh the the Dodgers one Fifteen zip some going all those baseballs\nNo I just think that they the the just like an NFL score he was there a plane could care less I mean they didn't there was nothing the brewers have not yet I felt like ours are like forty two to forty five and they're all in overtime it's insane um would you stop or overtime rules either there's got to be fixed to those\nUm so but this deal is one o'clock today is when the Dodgers play and they'll play the Rockies they host the Rockies\nAnd then the winter goes on to play in the division series to play the winner of the current game in the one that's on right now the brewers and the cubs the loser will play the loser of today's game wherever that game is if a Chicago loses the game will be in Chicago Milwaukee loses it will be in Milwaukee tomorrow

wildlife or or a airplane ... spending a lot of money to on these reveal part in the whole like you need another event in California I Would imagine\nThat gender reveal parties are going to get\nAround upon like\nWhy does it matter oh you know what are what gender it is how do you know what gender the baby is because you haven't met Jody ... you don't know that they let them identify like when we got ping pong the the ... office we were very strict with people when they came in and they were like oh he's so cute we said no no we just met this lemur\nWe don't know where his gender not assigning pronouns yeah absolutely not\nAnd that I think it's going to be the the the pushback on these gender reveal parties eventually\nBut there oh did you see there was one about in Louisiana guy brought out alive alligator at the wife's gender reveal party put a watermelon in the alligators mouth and the alligator went too far Trump's down on the on the watermelon and blue jello scorched out too far very far\nDennis Dickey is a border patrol agent he was off duty when he was celebrating his wife's pregnancy at a party and the green valley Arizona this was in April of last year\nAnd he had filled a target with colored powder so when it exploded it would reveal their child sex\nObviously think for a girl do for a boy in this case the target also contained Tanner right this is legal but it's a highly explosive substance\nYeah it'll it\nI'm trying to think of how to describe it\nIt does is make it very clear when you hit your target it blows up so it's not like a paper target or even a play pigeon or something like that you're hanging out of a tree this thing will blow up with\nA high velocity around so he takes aim at the targets\nAnd fires\nAnd it blew up and then went on to spark a fire that quickly spread through dry brush it was a lot of high winds at the time not a lot of rainfall soaked in and by the time the fire was finally contained the sawmills fire had done a million dollars worth of damage\nI ate by the way I absolutely hate the Washington Post for this story you know why\nThey never tell us what the sex this kid is bastards\nBut he never tell it tells you out of a million dollar fire they tell us about this guy shooting a explosive targeted by the middle of a dry\nField on a high windy day but we don't get the gender or feel about the story to reveal I feel sorry for your you tell the story because\nI'm going to find out what this baby as\nWell now writing a meeting ... there's there's nothing I mean outside of the hey don't shoot exploding things in a very dry area with a high winds\nOutside of that he immediately reported to the fire to law enforcement he admitted that he was responsible for it he was charged with violating Forest Service regulations by causing a fire without a permit which is just a misdemeanor\nAnd the U.S attorney's office announced that he had pleaded guilty um [laughter]\nDickey and his attorney couldn't be reached as of late last night to confirm whether the baby was a boy or girl\nIt's not anywhere [laughter]\nI'm like scrubbing the Internet to find out here is what I Wonder happened what if they don't want to say what the gender is because the baby doesn't identify as the gender that was revealed maybe\nShe gave birth to a gingerbread person mhm\nAs part of his agreement he is going to um get a starring role in public service announcements created with the U.S Forest Service\nOr he'll spend five years on probation he has agreed to pay restitution totaling catch this eight million one hundred eighty eight thousand sixty nine dollars he is on the hook and has agreed by all of it he says wow now whether he'll actually pay is different\nHe did make according to do as attorneys office he did make an initial payment of a hundred thousand dollars and then has been making monthly payments after that that he has agreed in court to pay\nFive hundred dollars a month for the next Twenty years which comes up very far short of the eight million it would only be about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars at that point so\nAnd then no discussion what would happen after the Twenty years or\nSo and if he he has he does keep his job ah with the border patrol because it says nothing to do with his job but no idea if\nThey had a boy or girl you know that's a that's a that's a that's a journalism failure right there no one can track down your gender this baby\nCouldn't just called the ... you couldn't call a neighbor and said hey what color is the baby's room and they go green\nIf anybody knows Dennis Dickey and knows what this baby popped out to be\nWell know agree yeah I think we have to pump the brakes on that deciding what the baby was because again the baby needs to make

that would\nBe where you go right that'd be one of the first people that I Wonder ... off the ground they I mean they've got the names of the other people that she says we're in the in the house at the time I Wonder if they're going they're first maybe ... yeah see well after fourteen\nMonths of talks between the United states and Mexico and Canada it looks like we have a new trade agreements it's gotten a different name now NAFTA is out in\nThe ... ... ... ... ... ... rental artist joining us\nMarc ... hey what's going on here what what are some of these differences between NAFTA and there's a ...\nA a a however you want to say at a U.S MCAA or a smoker I guess you could say but uh the the deal or does retain a lot of uh the NAFTA provisions but\nIn a way does update some things are from intellectual property protections for a new modern Arab because NAFTA's twenty four years old\nBut the other big headlines out of this a new trade agreement involve a differences in the auto industry which basically will require that\nManufacturers source more parts from North America and they pay a higher wages and then it will also are open up some agricultural changes for ah for the U.S\nBy opening up the door for a dairy producers in the U.S to get access more access into Canadian markets and so it opens the door for some different trade deals of course on the on this front between the U.S Canada and Mexico but really what it looks to be doing is setting up a template for negotiations between the U.S\nAnd and Asia Pacific a President Trump as we know withdrew from the the TV\nThe Trans Pacific partnership a and basically uh this could be setting up the way that President Trump and his administration look to negotiate and rain and possibly the deficits and and the issues that the U.S has with China\nCanadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau had oppose this deal until very recently why did he changed his mind was something added or subtract in to do that\nYeah I think there were two big things uh one is the is the dairy farms or the Canadian government want it to certainly protected dairy industry which is seen some reports saying roughly sixteen sixteen billion dollars for them so that's an important industry and what they basically agreed to do\nWas open that up to about three and a half percent of that sixteen billion or the U.S now can I can get into a more effectively ah so that's one sticking point on that than the other big thing is how disputes are handled between countries\nUh there's a provision in NAFTA it's called chapter Nineteen and it basically says that if there's a dispute between countries they go before a panel an expert panel made up of representatives of all three countries\nAnd then they kind of decided the outcome of the U.S didn't like that and President Trump didn't like that because he said it effectively a ... took down our sovereignty as a nation to enact terrorists and changes as we see fit\nBut the Trump Administration decided to leave that provision in there which I think ah for from a Canadian perspective is key because uh\nThe president has the ability to uh you know put tariffs on things and make changes and you can see the big difference between President Trump and President Obama for example and so it gives the country a little bit more security or or uh you know certain the end of the way that they can handle dispute\nNow oh go ahead does the president get to win on this I mean because when when we announced that there was a deal with Mexico everyone lost their collective mind because that means that NAFTA was dead and we weren't going to have a deal with Canada and they were we were still weeks away from a deadline at that point but it's kind of kind of get the wind here doesn't it\nYeah yeah in a way up slowly because you have NAFTA which which remember this is a very much the building blocks of NAFTA which remain um although he's called that as although President Trump has called that one of the worst trade deal ever [noise]\nAh the very building blocks of that deal are still in place but it's updated um it opens up um you know it continues certainly the uncertainty that you're talking about there when the U.S had to deal with Mexico back in August and you didn't have Canada involved and that\nThat uh throws you know a wrench into the system that's been in place for twenty four years now you have this\nUh a court again between these three major economies that many companies over the past twenty four years have utilized the provisions of NAFTA to uh run their business is this is why you see automakers for example\nAh like Ford and GM producing cars and Mexico and Canada and importing emitted the U. S. that how that was possible in large part because of NAFTA and so having this agreement between these three countries uh is is very important um and then again\nThis is all based on the fact that Congress still has to pass this so uh the W. here may be a have an asterisk until this is actually passed in Congress\n\n\n\nCarrying Shannon [laughter]\nA Hyundai is October first big stories that we have followed of course the chaos that has engulfed Washington DC\nOver the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation we know that the FBI is investigating and has been talking to people um at the I guess right after we give away money next hour we are going to talk with the political director and ABC News guy named recline spoken to him a couple of times before\nWe're talking about the politics that surround this confirmation now especially considering a Jeff Flake agreement\nJeff Flake seems to have found a way to make this about him yeah and maybe provide a little fuel for a twenty twenty run because he was the one\nWho seemed gives Jeff Flake is at odds with Trump right\nBeen critical of him and cabinet that Trump guy he went full all in with his Trump ness during that hearing when he was calling out Democrats and the Clintons and everything right\nExcept for the better part but the ... but yeah\nAnd so everyone's eyes kind of land and I'd just like what's he going to do is he going to vote to confirm and he said that he was going to vote to confirm and then women were at costing him in the elevator saying we were victims of sexual assault\nYou're telling us that we don't matter and somehow he changes his mind he finds himself in a phone booth yes they still exist on Capitol Hill\nOn his cell phone calling Rod Rosenstein by the way to ask him about how this FBI investigation would work and it can they get it done in a week and the whole back now people are saying as he is going on the speaking circuit he was in Boston this morning at a Forbes under thirty\nEvent is going to be a New Hampshire the battleground of New Hampshire\nThat later today if he's going to use this somehow to propel a campaign\n... what is it it's definitely a jumping off point for twenty twenty it could be for him I'm In that\nSame vein Kellyanne Conway was on with Jake Tapper yesterday morning talking about the political discussion around sexual assault allegation specifically against judge Kavanaugh and she sat on state of the union yesterday I feel\nVery empathetic frankly for victims of sexual assault sexual harassment\nAnd rent that [noise]\n[noise] I ... I don't expect judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper or Jeff Flake or or any model can be responsible for that\nIt's an interesting comment because they didn't do it right and but that but I think that's where her argument is that that Brett Kavanaugh was not the guy who did this too dark to Christine Blasey Ford back when she was previous\nKellyanne Conway doesn't know that she does anyone else well and and then that's the that's another issue that comes up is how are we going to determine whether or not\nSomething happened that the hash tag ... uh I Believe her yeah there's a there's a slight discrepancy there I think they should I think she has to be listened to\nAnybody comes out and claims that they had been assaulted or in any way like the anything resembling the they have to be listened to\nBut I but I don't well I think you mean they\nDid she was very believable that it it it's very real to believe that a sexual assault happened to her but if you weren't in the room how do you believe her that it was Brett Kavanaugh\nYeah yes thank you that's yes but you have to listen to her I mean it's it it would it's incumbent upon every one of us to listen to someone who's going to come out with an accusation like that\nBut we don't have the ability to determine whether or not that actually happened the way she said it happened but I don't I mean you saw her she's she's had some serious I'm asked to go down in her life just based on the way she was acting on that on Thursday\nAnd yeah she see and I said earlier she seems like she was stunted ad Fifteen Years old from this assault that she did not\nGrow very much emotionally and you know what that voice of hers does not ... it it ... to crystallize is that that thought in my mind and if she just seems very almost childlike\nAnd and to me that was embarrassing the Democrats put her in a position\nTo do that to she wanted this thing done confidentially\nShe did not want to be there she did not want that pressure and Dianne Feinstein in the way she handled that thing she could have turned it over to the FBI given it to them for their background check this guy months ago and didn't and that to me was was one of the issues that never really got talked about on Thursday\nTanya a west had the entire cast of SNL standing behind him on stage many of them are rolling their eyes and the clips and he just started this rambling\nAh talk\nBegan with him singing I Want to cry right now black man and America's supposed to keep what you're feeling inside right now\nTalking about the Democrats and a democratic

you can hear some of what he's saying\n\n\n[laughter]\nI Wish him\nAnd get out of that um so it turns out that the people in the background are raising their hands to the air like what is what's
