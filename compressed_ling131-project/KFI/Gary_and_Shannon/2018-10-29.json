is the that was not a a that was not a pleasant evening and Chavez Ravine last night\nWhen you asked me on Saturday\nYou said in very or in your way okay so where's your head out with all of this because we were watching I'm sure it shouldn't say we were watching the game the game was on when we were at an event on Saturday and used okay so where's your head with all this like do you want the Dodgers to win and I said of course not but\nI Love this game and I want I Want it to go seven I wanted to go seven\nGames I like I Want every game to be an Eighteen ... everyone\nWanted that I mean

I've got all the momentum\nAnd it goes back to a game one and Alex what and she left by as in and it goes back to ... to ... fifth inning\nGoes back to\nA lot of moves a lot of endgame moves by Dave Roberts and I know that's what got them there I Know how hard it is to get back\nTo back World Series appearances I understand that but sometimes you've\nGot to go with what's working for you\nTo go with your old baseball got and leave rich hill and leave ritual and take ... out I mean all of these there are all these things but did you see ritual gave Dave Roberts of all yeah I have never seen that before\nWell there was this narrative that hill said to Roberts I'm good to go but you gotta watch me what what do you walk one guy and then he struck somebody out and then he didn't like the match up I don't know All right well we'll talk more about that next are good or at a\nLater this the later today we do expect to see the suspected male bomber guy say started ... in court somewhere in Miami\nOr his lawyer who has yet to meet with him by the way a guy named a Ronald low weight\nHas apparently been hired by his family has a strange family to represent him but he says oh what we intend to do is raise his in competency were in need of a competency determination before he's transfer to New York it's important that we determine quickly but he's competent is\nPretty clear they believe that this guy is a is crazy or at the very least\nOf a diminished capacity where he wouldn't actually understand the charges against him [noise] ah and again this is the guy who was accused of mailing\nMall to poll um bombs\nFinger close to your bombs to different places around the country specifically to democratic and liberal politicians and figures\nThe latest is that a suspicious package address to CNN the Atlanta officers was intercepted in Atlanta and it was intercepted at the post office or wasn't actually at the CNN Center\nAnd in fact since this happened since last week when John Brennan was the address the at CNN in New York\nAll of the mail address to CNN has been searched off site and would have in fact gone through even if it wasn't caught at the post office it would have been caught at whatever outside site was sorting through CNN's mail before I went to the building\nSo the lawyer that we told you about last week who had kind of shed light on this guy because he had represented him the last time he was in trouble for a bomb or back in two thousand two when he was arrested for threatening to blow up a Florida utility company Florida power and light saying that it would be worse than September eleventh\nWell this lawyers been tapped by the family to represent him once again and he says that he plans to raise questions every single person saw this coming about whether this guy is mentally sound enough to understand the charges against him when he makes his first court hearing appearance today\nUm were also finding out that this guy has a history I mean\nWe thought it was somewhat listen nobody got hurt and all this uh don't just say that very clearly so I think that there is a little bit of room to point out the fact that this guy lived a crazy life okay a rosy\nFor the chip 'n' Dale ... and his own career as a kind of a stripper a guy and to the point where he felt like he was in competition with some of these other dancers and knew that if he was going to a if he was going to ever get in a fight with these guys he was going to have to\nJustice yeah it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm dead O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan Bessie trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with heart to overeat budding Myrtle\nRunning a murderer is now on the breed I our radiolab just open the\nCat [laughter] Burbank has got a big Atta Boy is one of them and bad neighborhoods so live in the entire universe on my show we make to fix on KFI [noise]\n\n\nShana we uh we had a lot going on today so we may have to do what they say in the business is a you know you're standing by for a news conference possibly out of it is for\nThe suspect in the synagogue shooting did make a quarter parents just a few minutes ago very little happened in terms of anything exciting just procedural stuff to get this guy\nA going but we do expect the U.S attorney to give us an update so when that happens will jump in with that also the White House press briefing is scheduled for eleven o'clock if they start that on time or\nWithin a few minutes of or coming back at the top of the hour we'll dip in to see what Sarah Huckabee Sanders has to say\nAbout what's been going on so that's all coming up\nLion air slight JT six ten was heading to bank called ... gang an island north of Jakarta when they lost contact with the air control about six thirty am local time this was just Thirteen minutes after take\nOff you know we know something happened because the pilot or an Indian guy had had reported technical difficulties and then a few minutes after takeoff actually asked for our T be returned to base to go back to the airport and it was granted\nSo a traffic control allowed to return but then this seven thirty seven max aid to the newest version of Boeing's a single idle workhorse vanished radar\nSuch a nightmare because it looked like everything was perfect weather ... the aircraft was new pilots experienced but it looks like this aircraft went into service like I said it just went into service months ago had\nGone in for repairs ahead of this final flight it was repaired and belly and then flown to Jakarta engineers in Jakarta receive notes did another repair before it took off Monday This is totally normal procedure for any plane\nWebsites that display flight data showed this plane's speeding up as it suddenly lost altitude and just minutes before it disappeared five thousand feet plunging into the the\nUm rescuers said that they believe all hundred and eighty nine were killed clearly I mean a hundred and Seventy eight adults they had one child to babies couple of pilots fly flight attendants are and the reason they say that is for one thing the plane going in a after having been a mile up going straight into the ocean is going to cause massive trauma and the way that they put it was\nA nobody survived the victims that we found their bodies were no longer intact is the way he said it's a it's been hours so it's likely that a hundred and eighty nine people died\nUm but they they have not yet as of this ah I just checked in the um the wires they have not yet found the black boxes three quarters\nSo but they expect to because if this thing went down to the debris field itself is relatively small let's go to Pittsburgh play can you bring this up from the TV we're ... we're listening to Scott Brady the U.S attorney for the western district Pennsylvania about this\nThe federal magistrate wherever he said I got older hearing for Thursday November first at ten am cut that time we will have the opportunity to present evidence demonstrating that Robert powers murdered eleven people for exercising their religious beliefs\nAnd then he shot or injured six others including four of them were police officers responding to the shooting our investigation of these hate crimes continues under the law we must present this case to a federal grand jury within thirty days of today [noise]\nOur thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victim's family and with the community and rest assured we have a team of prosecutors working hard to ensure that justice is done factor [noise]\nIt was quite All right so this is about Robert Bowers the shooter in the synagogue there in Pittsburgh his appearance in that courtroom over reporters inside say his hand cops were briefly removed so he could signed paperwork he only answered yes or Yes sir or to the judge's questions\nThey report that he seemed calm while talking with his attorney he declined to have the charges and potential penalties read and\nHe will remain in custody obviously\nUntil his next preliminary hearing twenty nine charges in connection to that shooting at the synagogue that killed eleven people six more injured I Believe we still have four in critical condition including an officer he was wounded in that shootout with officers\nAnd was released from a hospital this morning before he appeared in court yeah and we know that the uh the\nUs attorney Scott Brady their us attorney for the western district to Pennsylvania had said that they\nAre but you didn't I don't know if you said at the beginning of his statement just now but I Know he said in in the previous twelve twenty four hours that they will begin the process of going after the death penalty for this guy so um I I've no idea what a capital punishment looks like in Pennsylvania\nUh but uh or it wouldn't even be Pennsylvania the federal permit to appoint him so I'm so we'll see just usually the federal death penalty tend to go a little bit faster than ah than anywhere else in the country\nComing up next on the other side of Amy's news your chance at a thousand dollars how 'bout that ... something happy at least next on Gary enchanted\nPay of eyes guy to surviving for short one together we can cover more grounded we split up it's never just a cat [laughter] for free make sure and\n\nNow it's over following civil conflict when it came upon further instructions K bath with Angela in orange county or a [noise]\nA movie comes to life than maybe King Live from the camp by twenty four hour newsroom cops and the shooting of seven people at a club in riverside does not appear to be random\nThe shooting happened at Halloween concert called the first purge riverside police lieutenant Christian dingo says around midnight\nFrom people showed up and now and uh started firing people outside and especially for a quote fortunately there were no serious injuries\nSo seven people were hitting the arms and legs there at least two shooters\nIt really didn't have the feeling of an actor shooter with an agenda have more of a feel of a some type of a argument part of the shooting a recurring\nJingle says cops are looking into claims the shooting was gang related core Ben Carson KFI news\nAn officer involved shooting has happened in Hollywood had happened along Sunset Boulevard near the arc light theater around nine thirty this morning what led up to the shooting is not known police in San Diego say they've caught the man who shot and killed a navy sailor when he pulled over to help on the freeway Curtis Adams\nWas Twenty one he was driving with this girl find a girlfriend on the fifteenth freeway Saturday\nWhen he saw what looked like a stranded car he pulled over and got out to help police Adams was immediately shot and the shooter drove off\nOfficials say the driver may have been involved in a break in and shooting just minutes before the man accused of killing eleven people in a shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh has appeared in federal court us attorney Scott Brady says Robert powers is being held without bail\nThe federal magistrate judge scheduled her hearing for Thursday November first at ten am but that's on we will have the opportunity to present evidence demonstrating the Robert Bowers murdered eleven people were exercising their

correct it well\nThey were correcting some bad information that was out there an officer came out the ... and said there were some information describing this as a mass shooting it was not\nIt was very clear it was not an detectors from the gang unit had been following up on leads to identify the suspects involved no injuries\nUncomfortable rival gangs what tipped off to me is when I saw that five of the people who were shot had taken themselves independently to the hospital yeah those you'd have like I Need to get the hell out of here\nAnd maybe maybe you go to a hospital maybe you have a friend get that bullet out of your forearm and the kitchen [noise] 'cause you don't want to answer questions\nTo force such that you got in mature you know we've all seen that movie several bullet casings to different ... more than one person might have open fire and it's\nLikely that that's the case especially since there were multiple I'm a multiple caliber shells that were found a when officers arrived at the club they so they found to people suffering from gunshot wounds had to be\n[noise] God Bless you All right I'm allergic to gun violence um they had\nHad to be taking the hospital for treatment five other people and wounded in the shooting arrived at the local hospitals like you said on their own\nUm and none of them appear to be life threatening now no idea at least according to riverside pd\nWhat prompted the shooting so they had been interviewing witnesses those who will say anything there are nothing a and they're hoping to access other surveillance video from inside the club maybe in an effort to figure out exactly what happened but here's a here's the thing uh we're all so close to Halloween\nA huge number of people were in costume which is going to be difficult\nFor authorities to get a description of the suspect because they go hey what do you look like I looked like a werewolf\nOr you look like a a\nWhat's the guy from nightmare before Christmas jak scaling to he looked like jak skeleton whatever um anyway so they they have not been they have not arrested anyone as of yet in connection with this incident\nUh you know fights between gangs are rarely get press and I think it was just because seven people shot following what happened in in Pittsburgh and it's still a a healthy number there seven but the fact that this was at a purge event isn't the purge isn't it that that uh\nIsn't that story about how you get one day to kill everybody want to kill\nYeah for twelve hours or so or every crime is legal only four hours twenty four hour yeah that's a long time yeah the crazy thing about the story is the government was the one who originally a ordained it yeah because every other day of the year there's no crime everything else was safe and right\nOh so it's ... idea of\nThe most recent one actually they are in the most recent movie they did like the ... I didn't see the movie but I watched a bunch of things but they they uh they said that the government started it and everyone was just partying and have a good time so then the government said soldiers into start killing people and people started freaking out so that people started killing each other\n... so it was like a good story how many of these shows have you seen Blake\nThey go to

to go with it the problem is I I don't see how the I don't I don't know I don't know how you keep the guy I Know he's a I Know he's a fixture for the Dodgers but clearly they've got a guy who can replace him in ...\nI haven't got some good sporting news before we get to the mess that was that World Series [laughter] okay\nOur our friend our friends the same man that I accosted in a tunnel in Cleveland yeah it's been named the interim head coach of the Cleveland Browns your kidding I Am not kidding you oh that is and isn't that great\nA I'm going to have to find a signed some clips where to clip it up and clip it up with a Gregg Williams today I'm it turns out that the Dodgers lost again five to one take my eyes out in the game one\nWhat every single game this is the thing about what what happened with this is that\nIn the national league championship series you go up against credit counseling managing the Milwaukee Brewers where everything was on the table like am I going to put a ... minute to pitch the second inning maybe because that's what I Do right is what I Do so\nYou had to have ... Robert de Roberts Dave Roberts on his on his uh on his toes I mean he had to\nIt was punch counter punch maybe I didn't punch in you kind of counter punch before I punched and then\nAll these different managerial moves that we hadn't seen to this point and then you go into the world series where\nAlex ... much more ah down in the middle of the road I'm going to ride my starter until these bad kind of guy so de Roberts has to change the way he's going to manage which\nI didn't like the idea of the three hottest bats being seated and with Peter saying and and ... and ... a ... against the left handed pitcher I just don't like that I don't like that way of thinking what the World Series I get the analytics I get that they work for a hundred and sixty two games\nBut when it's a seven game series I like the bets are off and you know I heard Don McLean say it on on am five Seventy he had talked to a lot of er and there'll be insiders last week this week and you know he said analytics are great but they don't account for heart they don't account for passion they don't account for you know the crippled\nGuy who's been dug out all night and has he gonna come headed out in Nineteen eighty eight you know what I mean analytics would have said don't put in a cripple [laughter] I mean it's just it's just insane to me that you would sit like three of the biggest the hottest bats you know going into the world series\nWhen I heard this war the top four Dodgers homerun hitters for the year yeah we're not in two of those line\nRight I just don't I just don't get\nThat\nAnd I don't get taking hail out I was well now the ... I hate people like me that are going to sit here and call in sports radio and\nBe like what are you doing today Robert obviously I'm not in a manager in major league baseball\nBut I'm On I mean there's a there's a couple of things that I thought it should not have happened or by the way the robbers job is not in jeopardy you definitely coming back I don't think anybody questions that\nUm but one of the things that I was surprised at is one day Roberts was asked about rich hill on Saturday Night\nHe said Richfield told me hey keep an eye on me yeah to me that's one of those things that as a manager you don't say like you don't\nJust as it is you know thrown out of the bus well if you don't throw 'em under the bus you protect him you say listen we had a conversation you don't have to get into details because\nThey showed last night in the highlights they showed the robbers going out there and uh whoever was saying listen day Roberts told us before the game that he was just going out there to check on rich hill but ritual gave him the ball and walked out of the game he\nKnew when Roberts went out there it wasn't honey cat he knew what the message was going to be and it's I'm taking you out\n[noise] they Roberts is it going to go out there if he's not going to take somebody out and he said\nYou told the reporters that he was there he was just going to go check on him\nAt that point here's the thing it was a great season is the Dodgers\nYes it's been Thirty years but how many times we won the way the six times in a row or something they were ten\nGames below five hundred times already ten games out of first place I think it was it early in the season which is hard to do it it's hard to get that far behind that early in the seas\nAustin was a hundred and eight when team they were clearly the better ball club they just war and the cubs win the cubs came back down three games in the world series they were a hundred and eight when team to it just wasn't going to happen I don't think anybody watching that series\n\nThe Boston just look too damn\nAnswered every time\nYeah that that was the weirdest part about this and perhaps the ... the showing of the most Brazilians was that every time the Dodgers would score the it seemed like the the Red Sox wasted no time the next half inning yeah they would put somebody across the plate\nI mean just look what happened with the Saturday Night with that week home run with that we guy that was a sweet home run and it was it was but so but then to\nTurn around and just you know Chris Sale gets up off the bench in the fifth inning there and start screaming at his teammates hey we can't do that we can't allow this to happen and then they they drop nine runs on the board just like that like it was no big deal and\nWe had to run up to sail last night and embrace him in that manner\nWith an odd anyone else while I was what I was concerned for Chris sales like a little baby\nLike he would like it late in the picture was like a toddler and sell his dad and he just he ... it was like a koala like a like a guy with an upper body yeah\n[laughter] and ... and a cat her out ways how good it was on mounting Amy [laughter] I'm not saying I missed the mounting a\nBlight give me my computer back 'cause I'm gonna I'm gonna figure I'm going to turn that off wait for this live night oh and then I'm going to play this live from the file sharing and so I don't\n[laughter]\nI Can't wait to see young guy fly\nBecause what you can be\nWorse ah we gotta get Gregg Williams on the show I don't I think I ruin that for us when I uh when I was a see something say something in a tunnel in Cleveland should not get a no\nFly\nZone online ran one\nSoccer [noise] ...\nOh I Love that guy uh congratulations Gregg Williams name the interim coach for now I Know and whenever I say I love Gregg Williams I always get at least one email saying this was the bounty gay guy here to celebrate that guy yes\nYes yes I can have a motivational speaker like Greg Williams in my bedroom every morning when I woke up you know start the day\nIf he was your alarm tone yeah that well you\nKnow like my cello steam you know like if he could put out half affirmation daily I subscribe to that\nMy Joel ... and by the way it's not like Greg Williams was the only coach in the NFL right telling guys I'll give you a hundred bucks extra if

I don't understand how much of a conversation she has with the president every day because they ask her to be the mouthpiece for the president and for the administration but\nI I don't even think she understands what he's trying to say I mean she has her version of the story that she's trying to put out there and she's trying to answer the questions as best she can uh but I'm not sure that she understands his reasoning behind all of this now\nIn the news conference the press briefing the daily press briefing which has not been a daily thing she explains the president's plans to go to Pittsburgh tomorrow and\nTo um to offer condolences he in the first lady and referred to the president's own family members in terms of why this is such a personal thing for for President Trump\nThe president cherishes the American Jewish community for everything it stands for and contributes to our country kid doors Jewish Americans as part of his own family the president is the grandfather several Jewish grandchildren his daughter is a Jewish American and his son in law is a descendant of Holocaust survivors\nTomorrow the president and first lady will travel to Pennsylvania to express the support of the American people and grieved for the Pittsburgh community\nFrom what I think your question [laughter] [laughter] that's\nThat's I think the first time I've ever heard her get up about anything like that and obviously it was when she was talking about the kids are in the in the president's grandkids being Jewish as well um but this the the questions came up I mean in the context of that tweet this morning the question came up immediately well how is it that\nYou know if if the news media wants to ask questions is the president's rhetoric part of what's behind all this anger why can't the president that fire back and say I may be part of it which he hasn't said but what you guys are also doing the same by\nInvoking my name as being the guy who's responsible for all of the rhetoric she actually spoke with a a Jonathan Karl front of the show here\nUh we spoke to him before as well and it was a he was asking that question how can the president is the president blaming the media for these about\nTrying you know I mean why is the author and very very first\nThing that the president didn't was condemned the attack smoked in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bomb the very first thing the media did was blamed the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous I\nAccepted outrageous that that would be the very first reaction was so many people are brought her this country I'm not finished\nThe only person responsible for carrying out either of these heinous acts were the individuals who carried them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie Sanders fault for the individual who shot up a baseball field of congressional Republicans you can't start putting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime\nWise for me just give me the other person is the one I'm pleasing claim here\nNo the president not my thing mine the president's not it's not responsible for these acts\nAgain the very first action that the president did was condemned ah\nThese heinous acts the very first thing that the media did was condemned the president and go after and try to place blame not just on the president but everybody that works in this administration\nThe major news networks first public statement what's to blame the president and myself included I mean that is outrageous that anybody other than the individual who carried on the ground would hold that responsibility\nI don't think they were blaming the president they're blaming the rhetoric that is gasoline on on a fire I think that that that's what it was and then you find out that this guy's a wallpapered his entire van with\nA pro Trump stuff I I I I I Do agree with her that everyone was real quick to say oh this is a crazy Trump supporter but they were right it is a crazy Trump supporter yeah it's crazy that probably has a lot more to do with it then the fact that he's a Trump supporter but\nYou know ... and at the same time the guy in Pittsburgh was a crazy anti Trump guy yeah I mean he hated depressing because he thought the president was controlled by Jews\nThan thirty thousand people have signed an open letter to President Trump that was written by leaders of a Pittsburgh base Jewish group saying that he would not be welcome in the city unless he denounced white nationalism and stop targeting and endangering all minorities there was a rabbi rabbi Jeffrey Myers\nMonday I was over twenty nine out of the hour we'll look\nOn the story of the cues shooter the tree of life\nSynagogue from over the weekend

before the judge was essentially cold that he was you know facing these charges uh uh and and that whether he understood them and whether he understood his rights\nUh and then from there they essentially said that they're going to come back on friday to determine whether or not he should be held in jail as he awaits trial and then following that determination they're going to start looking at the removal process and whether he should be taken to New York\nOr its attorneys are are just beginning that stage to look at that stuff and right now the complaint is filed in the southern district of New York so that's where he said the extra extradited too so that for profit is going on it's a very procedural process is going to take a little time to hash out\nWhat was his demeanor today\nHis demeanor was he was he was engaged with his attorney says he waited there I was speaking with U.S attorneys one on one at there were\nSome who said that he was emotional ... at at times I did not see that it backwards to me uh but his attorney said he was emotionally than he was instructed by his attorneys not to say much at the attorney called me afterwards or one of his attorney said that uh you know it's not the time to make her faith and it's not the time to\nYou know uh to do anything it's your time to appear before the judge\nBe polite or and then continue on with it the process and so the only thing you really sets aside nodding his head yes that he understood what was happening or what the judge a nice day he left the courtroom\nOh this is a ... you know that's a little odd and this was the same attorneys that represented him back in two thousand to a with regard to a different bomb threat is that right\nI don't know I think that's actually a different attorney oh I Know\nIt's I Know that one of the attorneys representing about it represented in some cases I Believe those were some of his ... cases but I Believe that the the two thousand to bomb a threat with another attorney in in which case I say I was given probation on that one\nUh in the background of today's court appearance was yet another device it was apparently found in Atlanta what do we know about that\nYeah we know that this is the leaping out either he's a device or in this spate of devices that were sent over the last week this one addressed the CNN it was intercepted add in Atlanta area post office\nI in in a statement from CNN president said basically that it was never going to get to see it in the first place because It's Wednesday Wednesday burst of I arrived at CNN in New York uh the the network has changed its mail screening process\nAnd so they're actually screening male off right now uh I don't know if that's permanent or temporary but at least\nThere was never going to get to the location of the first place but we understand it to be a fifteenth devise a which which increases that total we don't know when it was sent it's either ... or the the suspect obviously ... authorities believe are behind this uh you know did not have any accomplices than perhaps this device was set out last week\nAnd was in transit but the political inspection service noticed it and notify the FBI and they came to collect at\nThis guy apparently had quite a long list of people that he was going to go after huh\nYeah that's right I was just are just hearing about this that essentially he had a list of people that he was um a interested and and\nWhat authorities believe could have been a other potential targets and so uh that is a vote could be a critical piece of evidence obviously and part of showing\nAs a potential his motive or he may have the kind of damage that he would have continued to further do especially as they start to a look at whether or not he should be let out of jail without a sale is the question of whether or not he still has people that he's\nIntending to target so that's a that's a very important record that just came out\nUh we've been you know he's had a pretty colorful past I mean as a stripper as a DJ um but for the most part it looks like he's been living in his band or for the last whatever period of time this is are we running on the assumption or I should say are investigators running on the assumption that\nThe ban is where he was doing all of his work or where he was putting together these bombs\nYes they are and that was a critical development over the weekend because forties we're very concerned about the possibility of more devices not only in the postal system but potentially wherever it was\nA allegedly making these devices and so when authorities impounded that ban\nA ... on the morning it as a raft and they started going through it they are allegedly found a stamp papers a printer and soldering equipment and that has led them to believe that he was building these devices are allegedly building the devices inside that ban\nOn from there that that helps a bit of my the odd that there are other devices out there however as we've talked today where CNN there were still from at least in the postal system so that that that's that's the way that we know\nMark great stuff thank you so much appreciate it thanks for having me\nMark rumble or they're in Miami the latest on the the bombing suspect too appeared in court today um couple of things to before we wrap up a swamp watch there was a secret service or imposter\nI Love this story Seventeen years\nOld yeah Thomas Michel beret hand that's a lot of names charged four counts of impersonating law enforcement after he was arrested yesterday he had traveled to four different locations in Greenville\nCounty North Carolina um South Carolina sorry a flashing a badge and a hand gun carrying handcuffs in a radio off identifying himself as an officer with the secret service or an agent with the secret service spending on who we talked to and was driving a silver Ford Explorer with a siren and working blue light\nApparently he has a relative who's actually a law enforcement officer that he was able to get this stuff from but this is a little something I like to call ambition here's a young man who wants very badly to serve behind the badge and I think that\nUh I think too that we shouldn't punish him well he wants to do good here's the thing\nWhen you see his picture and I tell you he's Seventeen you say there's no way that kids seven\nHe's eleven he looks really good as a young looking Seventeen\nA but hey I'm I guess I guess that's what people do now or the president's travel plans for the next few days we

capability or whether you're the importer so we don't want them to cross that way in the first place and we will part of the fullest extent of our laws out to those who do cross where we\nStarted one big very much for us um\nCustoms and border protection talking about the plans to deploy us troops to the border a while this has been going on we're still several\nWeeks away from one of these migrant care of and it's actually making its way to what whatever part of the border that it's aiming for 'cause it's got to go all the way through Mexico basically they just\nA few days ago were able to cross the border now there is another migrant caravan of several hundred people that is trying to get into Mexico\nFrom Guatemala and listen to the wildly outrageous thing that Mexico did they put federal rallies on the other side of the river and are not allowing\nPeople to come into their country well how mean is that they're trying to get across the ... river don't know if I'm saying that right and those hundreds of migrants who were there were met by ranks of Mexican federal police to block them from entering\n\nAre people going to protest Mexico\nNo\nYou know what was going to protest us when we put troops on our borders I don't know you know it's interesting the Democrats have been totally silo out that ... they know they into the mid term you imagine if if ten days before the midterm elections they go hey ah\nYou know let's roll out the red carpet for seven thousand people that we have zero ability to take care of a\nThat is a year I think that's an incredible observation the migrants on this bridge by the way I'm\nAppear to be preparing for a second day of confrontations today\nThey have been trying to take the route that the larger of the two caravans took a few days ago but listen ten days ago when they realized that they could way to cross the river or a load across it on rafts\nThe Mexican police said wait a minute we can't do that again so the Mexican navy has been up and down the river they've helicopters in the sky to make sure that these guys don't cross and they put Freda rallies on the other side of the bridge but nobody says anything and no one has a damn thing about it because\nYou know who knows maybe they are saying something about it in Mexico but nobody's saying about anything about it here\nBut we're gonna we're gonna be the whole I don't know what are we are going to be a whole that's the thing nobody is calling us the AA holes yet\nI just wait wait until November seventh hey we get an\nUpdate on a story we told you about last week out of Kentucky remember that grocery store shooting\nIt looks like the guy who is charged with killing two people at that supermarket remember it was just outside of Louisville and Jefferson town Kentucky it looks like before he went to that supermarket\nHe tried to enter a predominantly African American church and now they're looking at this like a hate crime um he's white the two people he killed\nAre black and this happened on Wednesday and there are indications\nAccording to investigators that he did choose his targets because of the color of their skin or hear the
