I ... ... Alex showed me this I went nah come on really and so I'll share that with you just go to the er at bill handle show in the U.S to ram okay [noise]\nSomething going on a in Madison heights it's a Detroit suburb and the city council just voted five to one passing a resolution or to discourage at least\nWell actually use resolution saying nope corporal punishment a hit free zone in\nKey public spaces city hall public library police station recreation centers\nYou can't hit your kids\nThe first sign went up on a Thursday last Thursday and civic center park near a high school\nAnd uh the councilman David does sold has said uh well the cost of the city is gonna be very minor or why because it's the cost of signs that said\nThe resolution carries no penalties no enforcement power or know mom and dad will get a ticket for slapping a kid's rump\nUh but uh the\nCity is hoping that the signage this blunt signage will get people talking and think twice about how the discipline their kids\nNow this is fascinating as to where government starts and stops\nUsually when anybody argues nanny state I say oh come on hold on them and it really put a for example a vice or a motorcycle him helmets nanny state oh please like seatbelts I remember that nanny state government shouldn't be involved\nOh that's an argument we've had for a long time uh but when it comes to telling parents how to raise their kids whether corporal punishment used to be used or not that's a whole nother another matter now I Want to make it real clear that there is a point of which are the parents over the line\nAnd that is when a child abuse happens or excessive force although I don't know what excess of forces and the problem when you're dealing with excessive force a parent hitting a child has\nTo be so over the line that there is no issue at all on the line is a huge problem a little bit over the line is a huge problem when saying it's excessive force we're talking about in general\nSo I mean your kids around in public places\nAnd at that point you go are you talking about whether or not\nA parent\nShould be told whether or not what kind of discipline to use other trials\nNow I'm not a big fan of corporal punishment I'm never hit my daughter's ever ever ever although there have been times when uh I thank God I'm not near any heavy piece of cookware when I'm Around them when they act it out\nAs a matter of fact\nIn my family the only person who's ever hit her kids Marjorie\nA it's a you know twice I think she's had a they kids once when they were toddlers and uh they uh one ran across the street almost got hit by a car and she got a good just slap on the rump saying no no no don't do that\nAnd uh the other one was a last week when Marjorie beat one of my daughters are so badly that we almost called the paramedics\nAre actually that's not true at all I just want to point that out just in case she's listening but it's it's a question of the state can get involved in that I mean corporal punishment truly truly is an issue for the parents\nAnd at some point and this is I don't know why it's a Detroit suburb I had no idea I Would think it would happen here in California I Would think it would happen in Berkeley where all my God if you get your kids or you go to jail for Twenty years\nAnd what the council person that uh that passed this a first proposed and had passed it's really a non violence resolution against violence on any level\nReally okay now is that violence when you slapped by your child around slap your kid upside the head slap him silly bruising sharing\nA just real quickly yeah I have kids but were you raised with corporal punishment than mom or dad slap you whenever you there's something wrong\nAnd I think I remember getting spanked once and I remember my mother choking me one that's good choking strong\nAh she was mad at me because I hadn't cleaned up my room and she was going ballistic and I thought she was acting so crazy I started laughing that was a bad move that was not never lateral Adam mad woman no never it is a I later learned that that day yeah\nBad move yeah she's just not like it when I bring that story uh oh All right uh you got twenty go we've got plenty going on today oh my gosh\nDo it yeah Nikki Haley was all about the timing of this accent huh is it because she's taking flights that aren't being done by the book or is it because she has aspirations for twenty twenty or does she not want to deal with Trump is she failing and the un will get into that also the tail of the waitress who messed with the wrong married man\nAnd involved so why is handcuffed and her husband to the bed at night so that he can't\nA run off with the waitress the great story\nI mean it's not a great story for the waitress who ends up dead but\nOh yeah I didn't know you were going that far oh yeah well I didn't go that far they went that far I understand um\nRats have taken over a neighborhood in van Nuys and Anthony wiener is going to join the show I mean not today but at some point\nWe're going to get them in Studio seriously it's already been confirmed now oh you're just throwing it up [laughter] you

... live from the KFI twenty four hour news you're a man that Governor candidate John Cox and Gavin Newsom have debated their differences on issues like the gas tax climate change and immigration and

from\nThe ... the way these names like ... we know the ... historical tours of the play and the atrocities committed to our leader at that time luckily\nThere's also that little pesky issue of the investigation into some flights you received I'm not\nSure of that is a I mean I saw that as well that one didn't hang for me in terms of something to be concerned about\nOr concern isn't the right word but something that that caused this um resignation because that's the case I think she would have done it relatively soon I'm she wouldn't have waited until the end of the year but the question that I came up with was a\nWas she perhaps the author of New York times op ed piece I Know she denied\nThat would be quite diabolical I Would talk about the movie\nI mean to to to write that and then to make those comments today the way she did\nRight with the ball washing sex\nCan't say that oh yeah I mean there's a team on the sidelines but does carry extra ones she may be one of those and just keeps it you know you got to keep them dry so that their grip is good\n[laughter] I don't know I can I have no idea what we're talking about any more probably better than [laughter] um but like\nYou said she there are times when she has butter dads with this president do you remember the the one time but she became sort of a player in the campaign was when she gave the Republican response to\nPresident Obama's state of the union address what would be his final state of the union in twenty sixteen and this is what she said in that state of the union that caused everybody's eyebrows to fall off their head like Ernie and Bert\nDuring his time it can be tempting to follow the car and call and the angry voices we must resist that temptation no one who is willing to work hard abide\nBy our laws and love our tradition should ever feel unwelcome in this country now at the same cancer that does not mean we just flat out open our borders we can't do that\nIt was a direct shot at then candidate Donald\nTrump often times the White House and Nikki Haley has had different narratives that there are espousing remember back uh gosh I don't even remember when I was\nUm but\nShe had announced more sanctions against Russia at some point in the White House said no I think that she's confused and she shot back and said with all respect I don't get confused\n[laughter] I Love that oh she has had a declining influence at the un now um there's a slew of recent Trump decisions that\nMany others oppose so she lost a little weight they're recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel I'm cutting to Palestinians announcing the U.S withdrawal from the un human rights council those things did not go over well at the un\nI also wonder sort of as a sub chapter to that I Wonder what it's like to be a a female ambassador at the United nations because there are still plenty of countries for women are not respected in any sense in terms of politics or foreign policy like that and I wonder if\nNot just Nikki Haley but Susan Rice as well as anybody before that who may have been in that position that's got to be an odd place at some you know in some of those meetings yeah because they're not you can tell going into it you're not getting the respect that you deserve for being where you are anyway and one of the\nYear and I'm Sorry what I don't know you stop it [laughter]\nAnd now the\nQuestion is going to be of course who will be named as the next ambassador to the EU and how quickly will that happen could be a couple of weeks could be a whole ... depends on when the president wants to get this person confirmed obviously and how soon they want us to to take place\nUh one of the names that Rick Klein who was the political director for ABC News we talked last week one of the names that he threw out as a possibility was a volunteer Trump\nI'm not sure that would be a great I Know in terms of the position because the lack of experience I think is going to be a massive issue\nBut are they just throwing that I I I think that's one of those like yeah I I Would be an ... sort of a not on the short list but on a list at some point Jared Kushner is the other the other possibility\nNikki Haley was effusive in her praise of Jared Kushner today saying that he's one of the most brilliant minds quietest minds in the White House today\nAnd politically he does not line up with the president Frank terms of a general or you know general political ideals so\nYou cry at a this is us Monica I don't like this is a while yeah I'm Sorry you know or a doctor weekend but I Can't well All right hold on I have cry watching this is us I just think the show's boring ... unpopular opinion sorry let's give away some money to get that\nUh was safe I mean the suspension the

Florence came up on shoring up north and South Carolina [noise]\nWant to tell you about the story of a woman named Heather Elvis\nTwenty years old lives in South Carolina she\nAnd a couple of years ago and her abandoned car was found near a boat landing and they're in Myrtle Beach\nAnd\nWhen that was found it looks like people on social media continue to talk about Heather and it was not in any thoughts and prayers kind of way\n[laughter] investigators were were able to go through her cell phone records to find out what had happened to Heather and certainly what had happened to her before she banished they led\nThe records led police to a man with whom Heather was having an affair\nSydney Moore was his name and Sydney was married to Tammy and Sydney and Tammy were\nThe ones that were all over social media ripping this girl to shreds even after she was missing\nTheir first of all there are a couple of um red flags that I Would assume investigators saw that I see when I go look through this thing and I am not a sworn law enforcement officer\nNote surprises you but for example when Tammy again the the husband and wife sitting in Tammy when Tammy wrote about Heather\nWell Sidney cheated on me and the month of September October with a psycho whore who has since went missing\nShe read that on Facebook now we all know somebody like that don't way we all know somebody who over share over Facebook it gets a little too personal ... it's like come on what do you do and yeah\nMore stayed solid pieces of the foreign policy team right which is why her her leaving now are leaving yeah yeah I think that's what he was getting at what does ...\nDoes not I don't know uh what is he now what does he done any way you tell me Nikki ... uh no I'm Sorry what did she done anyway that was my ah that was my feeling when she was named UN ambassador I remember that 'cause she was you know living life in South Carolina\nHow would she no foreign policy experience no but she totally check that box now oh yeah I mean the next position up because they they left it open the president left it open for her to come back and even said some comment along the lines of you know she could have any position she wants when she comes back to the cabinet if she comes\nBack she definitely had the highest approval rating out of anyone a amongst Democrats Republicans and independents\nI Would imagine the next step for her if she's so chooses and if it works out would be secretary of state yes if my ... decides to step down or if it at any time and it\nWill do that and that's part of it as my compounds the inner circle she was not in the inner circle true anyway I'm OK Heather Elvis as you were telling you about twenty year old girl she has an affair with a guy she needs to that at her place of business which is the tilted killed as she ends up going missing\nSo they met because she's a waitress and he was working there or he would come in and do repair work there\nAnd they start some sort of a relationship he would come by and bring her coffee and bagels are friends had said she even talked about moving to Florida and joining his family as a nanny so that she could be closer to him\nHowever it looks like things soured at least at some point because on social media she wrote once upon a time an angel and a devil fell in love it did not end well\nAnd that was just weeks after they met\nAnd a couple of months before she went missing\nSo in October is when the relationship is officially called off because according to a cording to Sydney the guy is wife Tammy found out about the fact that they were getting it on\nShe exploded she got on the phone and was calling this girl Heather she was texting or she sent a photo of her husband having sex with Heather\nYeah and she would call and say you're going to end it with my husband this is all testimony from the uh the roommate from Heather's roommate she would say you're going to end it with my husband and then she would put Sydney on the phone and she would sit there will Sydney and had there were talking\nAnd\nThe things ended on the phone but city would make comments to have their like you meant nothing to me you were just someone who spread your legs and basically tore Heather apart as a human being\nAnd but that didn't end it even when he was on the phone ending the relationship with Heather Tammy was in the background and she would constantly send these disparaging nasty messages to uh\nTo Heather yeah there was one tax to November that said hey sweaty sweetie ready to meet the missus and had their rights back uh I think you're a little obsessed with me I'm nobody you need to worry about any more\nAgainst all of this is September October October's when they end the relationship a couple of months later sit a Heather things but this is all over the whole Sydney Tammy thing she's not gonna have to worry about them anymore even started dating a guy she went out on a she went to walk or drive around and look at Christmas lights with this guy\nRight she had a new job as a makeup artist she was going to church with her roommates\nAnd it looks like a Sidney reached out to her uh actually the same night as that date when she was going with the guy to look at holiday lights\nYeah she told her roommate she was really excited about this guy was really cool and then about a half an hour later it is like one o'clock two o'clock in the morning half an hour later she calls a roommate and says I'm I just talked to Sydney\nAnd he said that he left his wife and he Mr and he wanted to see her and be with her and then that that Heather got mad and said don't do that you're finally moving on with your life you're happy again you're yourself\nUp to thirty Heather lead two thirty in the morning have their leaves the house and drives to a bar in Carolina forests she's there until about three in the morning\nGuys just go to bed you get you through what ... what are you doing it can't you can't leave the house for a new destination at two thirty am is a good\nGeneral rule she tries to contact send you a bunch of times between two thirty in three Fifteen in the morning and then finally gets a hold of them in about three Nineteen in the morning talks to him for four minutes drives to a place called peach tree\nBoat landing that's where they found her car the next day that was the last any activity was recorded of hers\nSurveillance footage shows a vehicle that matches the description of Sudanese\nGoing from his home to the boat landing and back out he told investigators he had no contact with the other day that he was with his wife who had again handcuffed him to the bed\nAs per their agreement\n[laughter] hey he agreed to be handcuffed to the bed\nBut a a investigators do have footage of him at a pay phone at about one thirty in the morning he claims he was calling Heather too as tell her to stop contacting him up for\nThis twist in there as well detective said ah okay Sydney what about this video here that shows you buying a pregnancy\nTest and he says oh no no that was for my wife even though they have a record of Heather texting Sydney about gaining weight and friends testifying that she was concerned she may have been pregnant so we can assume it looks like he may have said something to her\nIt wasn't until February two months after Heather disappeared that Sydney and Tammy were taken into custody they were charged with obstruction of justice in uh indecent exposure\nYeah not a lot of details about that except for those charges were later dismissed I just can't believe that they couldn't get a at least\nKidnapping and murder charge on these I guess they don't have a body and that's part of the problem yes but God obstruction of justice what does that carry a you know\nWell depending on the severity and maybe or\nI'm ... years tops and even men if if it was you know Rick you drink enough that they had to eventually uh dismiss later\nJust a terrifying story Heather Elvis Twenty years old south Carolina vanished and was never heard from after December nineteenth of two thousand three federal obstruction

Boston archdiocese\nOr to saint and in Nineteen Ninety who worked there until Nineteen Ninety three the churches since merged with two other parishes goes by the name of our lady of hope now but at the time of the transfer San Bernardino didn't know that they were getting bad goods\nThe Boston archdiocese did not inform the diocese of San Bernardino about his history a history that includes included alleged sexual abuse they maintained and I'm quoting here and the transfer papers that he has a priest in good standing\nHe was convicted subsequently of molesting a boy and Boston and the

is ... hey I have a boss back in Pennsylvania suggests we released a list of names of priests who have been kicked out because they've sexually abused killed that's a good idea maybe we should get a task force on that they've been doing this\nThis has happened before the diocese of San Bernardino the diocese of orange or not that far apart I Know they read each other's newsletters statewide\nThis is going to go on as well the diocese of Oakland says it is going to release an a list of names\nProbably within the next few weeks and then another list within a early twenty Nineteen they say the
