{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "[noise]\nOn a a Tuesday first game tonight World Series in Boston I Am a five seven even listen to that or\nShould I starting at five oh nine and a the gate older games will be covered by am five Seventy alright [noise]\nYep and then ... body parts were found\nThem put them together yet\nThey actually haven't put the story or him together yet to figure out a weather uh it's I think it's actually it is is pretty safe saves him for sure All right\nBooker senator from New Jersey Democrat Democrat oh boy you see a Democrat he's just introduce a bill at closing the gap\nWhat gap are we talking about well we're talking about the gap because the gap of the median white family today holds nearly ten times the wealth of a median black family\nIn Nineteen sixty three families at the top of the wealth distribution system had six times the wealth of those in the middle by twenty twelve it has doubled to twelve times the assets of middle income family so wealth disparity is upon us\nAnd I do it that we can go into all the reasons 'cause that would be hours and hours of talking but ah he has a plant oh does he have a plan\nDoes he have won a opportunity accounts\nGiving lower income kids a sizable nest egg in some cases fifty thousand dollars\nGiving it to them we're not talking about loaning it to him giving them here's some money that they could use for wealth building purchases like down payment on a house or college tuition and they're called opportunity accounts and theoretically\nWould make sure that all kids have a significant assets when they enter adulthood rather than just those growing up in wealthier homes or this idea has been kicking around since the early to thousands or at think tanks liberal thing thanks I might add\nBut a Booker is the first high profile senator ... to introduce legislation I mean it's being introduced\nSo I'm here's the argument specific governmental policies\nHave driven this racial gap to make it harder for minorities to accrue wealth a you've got the federal housing authority that spin refusing to underwrite housing loans to many black families that made it difficult\nWell I think that stopped a while ago and he talks about his own parents African American of course who had to poses a white couple to purchase a house in a predominantly white neighborhood Nineteen sixty nine\nThey had just basically lie about it because blacks were not given loans and it was all kinds of red lining well that was Nineteen sixty nine\nYou know I mean how far back do you go I mean I'd love to call Booker up and say hey they just found the Lindbergh baby you know that\nSo he's American opportunity account we give each child born in the United states a savings account starting with a thousand dollars\nAnd each year until the kid turns Eighteen the government would deposit as much as two thousand dollars and that depends on the family income with of course lower income families receiving larger checks now the accounts are off limits until the child turns Eighteen\nAt which point the accounts are released if they are used for ... building purchases specifics like a down payment on a house or college tuition by the way Booker hasn't come up with a a list of these purchases yet which relatable and which are not\nSo bookers office estimates that a child who remains in the lowest income bracket\nOf this program which means you get the largest or he or she gets the largest a payment two thousand dollar payment each year by the time of Eighteenth birthday would accrue forty six thousand dollars\nA child in the highest income bracket\nUh about this I Love a above five a hundred percent of the poverty line and this is the ... the money or the money given to a child\nBecause what is considered a low income family a hundred and forty seven thousand dollars for a family of four how many people who make a hundred and forty seven thousand bucks think are poor for a family of four\nGary what you're saying making a hundred and forty seven thousand dollars for a family of four would put you in line for governmental help because you're broke unit quadruple my salary and pretty much I don't know yeah so anyways uh his\nBook are crazy ... where are you but then again hey distribution of wealth asked Bernie Sanders ask Hillary Clinton what\nUh they think of a rich people hanging on their money or a book or has a lazy or a you know on top of that you know there is a uh I I there's a philosophy here there was something evil about ah being wealthy I used to be that way in England\nStill is that way in England there's just something wrong about having a lot of money All right Jerry\nYou know like that I Do you what are you having a lot of money makes you a evil oh I don't care [laughter] I don't care what people think\nAh we are going to start talking about what the Turkish president said today his explanation of the deaths of ... um and our CIA director Gina Haspel is over there in Turkey looking at some of the evidence allegedly so um and then this strange story about Sarah Silverman and Lucy Kay\nShe says she would watch him do his uh his you know thing to themself masturbating yeah that yeah uh I didn't care leery about using that word masturbation\nDon't like it when it comes out of
