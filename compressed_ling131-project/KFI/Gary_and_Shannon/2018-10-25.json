[noise]\nI don't you start with humans root Jon it well scammers forget the right opportunity and we are going to get away with it will get we have to to say on campus [noise]\n\nWhy am I here on a Thursday morning as we finished a show big stories of recovering a ten pipe bombs are now\nI have gone across the country we just heard from a micros your looks like\nFlorida is where they came from Megan Kelly out because of her statement of regarding black face a yes or a couple of days ago and uh tomorrow\nIt is a Ken Starr is going to join issued eight o'clock\nAnd also tomorrow getting three of the series Dodgers last uh last night so its side to zero and you'll hear the game at ... am five Seventy five or nine pm All right now the migrant caravan they're walking\nSo in other southern part of Mexico so there are several weeks away from hitting the border\nAnd uh this a caravan has become a huge political football and I ... it's the best thing that ever happened to President Trump and I think the Republicans because it has gotten other than Brett Kavanaugh this thing is just fired up the base why because\nThis caravan amongst these people have been demonized odd they're terrorists\nAre there are criminals there and a effectively they're going to destroy America if they come in and we have to make damn sure they don't come in by the way I think we do have to make damn sure they don't come in but\nYou know I think there's a way of handling it there there is an issue here of looking at these people\nAnd what they're trying to do is escape their families being killed I Know that's a tough one to understand uh the persecution or escape or just the utter poverty with no chance to succeed and we're having their kids have a chance at a decent life\nSo of course they're going to hike wherever they can and they're on the move now this one's a little bit different because it used to be people that came in over the border were Ninety nine percent Mexicans\nAnd this time around it looks like a it's a middle America or middle Central America or is Central America because that's sort of in the middle and ... that you were talking about Honduras Guatemala El Salvador and interestingly enough people from those countries have a better chance\nThan Mexicans because the way the law works is it is tougher for someone who comes from a country that borders the United states to get in than someone outside of ah that\nParticular a geography so they're trying to come up now I it's being\nAs are going to overwhelm our services or we're going to need the armed services there at the border to make sure they don't attack us in droves it's almost like the ... coming\nWell it's when you have several thousand at one time coming in uh yeah and they have a right to ask for asylum but the way the government has made this work and I think rightly so uh it's tougher and tougher and tougher for them to do it because there is a preliminary\nDetermination by a border official is there any basis for you coming in and asking for asylum any at all\nWell they had better come up with a real good reason because it is a very small percentage even make it to the next step\nAnd then it's a question of a backlog now asking for asylum as of right now they are released\nPending a court hearing and that could be months or years down the line and they're starting to grow those quote immigration judges who are not judges by the way I don't think for a moment they're independent or what they are are they are employees of the Justice Department\nAnd so we can swing either way but are there are ways of dealing with it of course there are it's just you have to ramp up a you have to be strict border which uh right now we are\nBut what it is not is the attack of workers people coming over the border uh with the zombies are coming and you can't stop him thousands and thousands of them are coming\nOkay [noise] and they're all carrying kids and they all speak Spanish she'll be interesting [noise] Shannon\nWe've got a police chase going on on the one oh one it is a a lift driver and I read Hyundai and he is trying to weave through the morning commute

laughter and Hoover I'm convinced something like this is going to happen\nAnd would you dispute the charge that's put on your credit card I Will\nLike the paperwork I'd probably just take it probably ah we're going to stay on top of that also we're up to ten packages now from this crazy person who sending bombs to Democrats and people critical of the president the president doubling down today on Twitter blaming the media for all of this\nAh Justin worship hosted the dad podcast joins us later on in the program talking about robots as parenting aids that sounds good the Dodgers blow it again

handled in the morning crew KFI am six forty [noise]\nThink about all the ways you can send a thousand dollars [laughter] I don't think too long when twenty minutes [noise] hey pacify deal with the Los Angeles Orange County and I are really more package panic\nI'm Monica ... KFI twenty four hour newsroom is suspicious packages\nHave shown up again in Delaware and New York address to former vice president Joe Biden an actor Robert De Niro the packages found this morning looked like others that were sent across the country to CNN and Democrats President Trump has denounced the bomb scares and says fake news has added to tensions\nReporter as reporters asked White House press secretary Sarah Sanders if the president should take responsibility for his own aggressive rhetoric\nThe president is certainly not responsible for sending suspicious packages to someone no more than Bernie Sanders was responsible for a supporter of his shooting up or Republican baseball field practice last year the idea that this is at the hands of the president has absolutely no\nTwo packages were also address to LA democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters one was sent to Washington DC and the other was stopped at a male facility and south LA LA county sheriff Jim McDonnell called the pathetic\nAnybody anybody anywhere in the chain of custody of this uh these practices that that that's really be a\nBe a casualty of of the package sent to the congresswoman was cleared by an LAPD bomb squad and then handed over to the FBI the FBI is inspecting all of the packages and a lab in Virginia defense secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign an order sending eight hundred\nOr more troops to the U.S Mexico border to support the border patrol Madison is responding to a request from President Trump says he's addressing what he calls a national emergency at the border a sex

councilwoman Nouri Martinez says police made more than Seventeen hundred arrests and the last three years\nThose ads have primarily been John than men who by women and girls for a commodity and toss them to the side\nI think that's an over characterization or over playing what this may have been because if you're looking at the what what makes up this a pipe bomb at least the ones that they have X rayed and the ones that they have at least given some of the details on\nIts PVC pipe it's not a metallic pipe and the\nAbility for that thing to cause an explosion I mean a PVC pipe is not going to hold as much pressure inside of it as a a metallic pipe would galvanized steel pipe\nSo the idea we're talking with Brian suits ah yesterday about this how these things work has to pressure that's built up on the inside of it whether it's an overt pressure or an actual explosion inside it then uses that metal casing to become part of the shrapnel that that makes these bombs so damaging\nPVC pipe is not going to hold that much pressure not to say that it wouldn't hurt somebody but it would be much less impactful than than a metallic type so yes it looks exactly like you would expect a pipe bomb to look\nBut people make explosives can look at that thing and say it's not the best they could have done I mean or the worst depending on your what your point of view is I guess\nNow there was a report that it looks like these did include sulfur shards of glass all scary stuff and we did hear yesterday that CNN device also had with it an awful lot of white powder that was going to be tested again very anxious to hear\nWhat new details we're going to learn and just a couple of hours from the terrorism experts that have taken a look at this stuff and find out if they've made any headway in determining\nWho sent this I mean it's a priority number one obviously right now in this country to find out who this person is so they go through the mail they find out where these things or you know where they were they put it would were they were put in the mail that the path that they made to the various destinations\nAnd see if they're able to get somebody and and put this thing to bet\nOn the outside of this everybody's looking at each other going you're the one responsible for it I'm a writer and the president says the media's responsible for the media says the president's responsible for some of the people who have been targeted by this I've said the president is responsible for it so well here I Want to play 'em for three or four soundbites from\nDifferent people sort of pointing passed each other nobody willing to say let's let's knock off this BS find out who did this and punished that person make a public display of how this is completely\nAcceptable what are

a nice little relationship\nLauren McCluskey she's from Pullman, Washington she just turned Twenty one she's attract start at the University of Utah and she's dating this guy ... ah\nHe had lied to her about his name his age and his criminal background it turns out that he was thirty seven years old\nShe breaks it off with him when she learns the truth and he won't leave her alone so she goes to campus police chief files or harassment complaint they're building a case and while they're building a case she's walking out of a night class on her phone with her mom\nProbably because she doesn't want to walk alone and he uh and he attacks are ends up by shooting and killing her and then goes and I'm an oft himself in a in in a church nearby\nYou just sometimes I don't know who people are I mean we're learning now from five different parole hearings\nBetween twenty ten and twenty Eighteen\nOfficials repeatedly expressed concerns about his manipulated behavior he goes on line to meet women he becomes wherever he thinks the woman wants him to be\nI mean it's just terrifying\nAnd and that manipulate the behavior\nApparently is what led him to be released from prison because at a hearing earlier this year\nHe talks about oh I'm a I'm a totally changed man I'm a pure leader in prison or a a father helped tapped me into my empathy\nYeah he's learning how to follow rules now that there is a different perspective now than when I had in the past one of these hearings I was a very selfish narcissistic man it was all about me two months later he gets an early release from prison ...\nHe had pleaded guilty in two thousand four to trying to lure an underage girl on line and the attempted sexual abuse charges he did a decade in prison\nAnd after he was charged with that there was another woman who came forward and said in fact yes he had sexually assaulted her after\nA separate meeting on line a few years earlier a few days earlier\nAt one hearing he said they had hoped to become a doctor but that his addiction to Internet sexual activity at ruined his life\nSo I'm so curious\nTo know how long they were dating and how she found out\nI Know well I think okay so they were dating for a month and I think what happens what everybody does is they online stock people well it gave the wrong name right and then that leads her to what to nothing\nMaybe leads her to a different person she realizes that that's not him and then maybe there's a couple of detail you know how easy it is to find out about things about people um maybe like if I were\nIn news I'd probably worked for the FBI or something not Hollywood I and I don't I'm not going to be full\nMe too there's got to be a market for that kind of scary for\nOnline dating a background check I Do it for your kids I Know

to the New York pd headquarters are holding an update on the bomb investigation\nShe's package investigations are conducting here in New York City first and foremost my message today is that New Yorkers are safe\nThere are no current credible threats twenty individuals organizations or locations here in New York City New Yorkers are safe\nBut everyone all eight point six million residents and the millions of visitors who come here every year should always remain vigilant\nAnd aware of their surroundings as always I urge people to alert us to anything that might seem strange route to place or anything that makes them feel uncomfortable they get flagged out a cop call nine one one or call our toll free counterterrorism number which is one eight eight eight New York city safe\nAnd that is for anything new or someone as information about any of the incidents this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make\nTowards our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as I Do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature of any other kind that nothing we do in law enforcement we do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision\nThat can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\n[noise] New York city's intelligence and counterterrorism kind of terrorism capabilities are second it on every day they are not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly poring over that threat stream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're saying that today too out of an abundance of caution I'll tell you that when we look at the events of yesterday and today I have a match pride in incredible work the men and women are the NYPD to each and every day especially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today\nAll concluded by reminding everyone and law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the publicly serves safe\nThat's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe and through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives and works in and visit New York city will make the safest large city in the United states even safer Mr Mayor thank you very very much\nCommissioner I Want to express my appreciation to all the men and women and YPG who have done an outstanding job\nYesterday and today addressing this situation and to all of our partners federal and state partners everyone has been working together\nTo address this forthrightly now a look one of the things that we emphasize the moment like this is that you're going to see a lot of police presence it's important that we proactively take steps to protect those who have come under attack\nClearly what we've seen in the last few days is an attack on media outlets an attack on prominent public figures or going to make sure there's expanded the president's as long as we need it\nUp to show very vividly that New York city takes these issues seriously that we are defending\nPeople who are coming under attack that part of how we protect the Democratic process is to show the threats like this not taken lightly so that they expect that presidents and I know that for those who have gone through this uh in the last few days that the president said they appreciate greatly\nWant to say that every day New Yorkers have responded to this situation with the kind of strength and the kind of resiliency that this city is famous for that makes me very very proud of all eight point six million New Yorkers as they have handled the situation\nA with a real sense of resolve or they're not going to let an act of terror intimidate them and that's a really important in this moment to say whatever the motives of the individuals involved\nAh the people in this city are not being thrown off their game or not having their values undermined or the way of life undermined New Yorkers are standing strong right now\nAnd the last thing I Want to say is you know it in a moment like this there's a lot of concern there's a lot of fear a clearly it's upsetting time it's a time when there's been too much hatred and too much division in the ...\nAnd in that context people can feel powerless I Want to remind people that everyone has an opportunity to play a positive and constructive role here uh first of all\nHelping law enforcement this is something that everyone can do if you have any information at all that you think could help law enforcement to address the situation share it with law enforcement immediately\nI'll let them be the judges of the value of the information don't hold it back\nA so many times and I agree with the commissioner of law enforcement that ultimately has proven they will find the perpetrators but so many times it's because uh an individual citizens step forward with information that really led to the key breakthrough you have information sharing\nIf you're concerned about uh packages that could arrive at your home or your workplace you see something that worries you reach out to the police get ah their involvement to address the situation\nPeople can be part of solving this immediate challenge but finally we all can be a part of solving the bigger situation that we're facing as a society as a nation a tone is civility a tone of mutual respect as something we all can create\nWe shouldn't just ask what are the most prominent voice is doing we also have to ask question are all of us\nTreating each other with respect treating men and women the law enforced will respect people in the media report the news treating them with respect this is something that we all have to do as a way of addressing a crisis like this and we can and I have great confidence that we will\nThe vices war but we ... we have to treat them as as a life devices a this is a political that are bomb squad people use and it keeps everybody safe in the background [noise]\n\nWe don't know at this time but ah with the postal services that that are here are we're doing the best to make sure that if there are any out there we identified and quickly\nIn the back seat however\nAnd also argue exploding bombs or you're saying and then just the\nWay our transporting uh whatever evidence we have down to Quantico and as far as ah the powder which is going to leave it as to what Bill said that it's not biological and we're still testing us in the background [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] for [noise]\nFilled you want to talk about the the first part of your question and John maybe you get the second part what we're doing proactively for which was the first part of the question again I'm Sorry\n[noise] now\nSo I'm not going to get into a specifically where we think the packages came from\nSomewhere obviously delivered or in the postal system or I'll leave it at that other than that I'm not going to get an description of where we think the packages originated I Would reiterate regardless of where people think that average needed if you see something suspicious suspicious or you think you may know information\nOr police provided to assist those two two points [noise]\n\nThe second part of that question of to get to the second part of your question a when there was the first device a targeting Mr Soros we went to all the locations that were associated with the Soros families ... businesses\nUm places that this or is a contribute to a when that are developed the next day with the the the bomb at the Clinton residents than the Obama residents we really widened our outreach or we have um\nA program called the nexus program we have the shield program so we have a lot of built in um\nIs kind of like you know the leaking into the package anything like that that is suspicious the public has to just leave packages side call nine one one get law enforcement over there\nAnd just one more question Steve ... because they were so tight lipped about um where were these\nBombs billed by somebody who is um [noise] who is good at this who knows what they're doing it this or was this just some crazy person willy nilly trying to scare people I've heard that it by keeping an information close to the vast if they're close to an arrest that will help them they don't wanna give us too much information how would that\nHow would that jeopardize and harassed ... if they told us that this person and they didn't really know what they were doing\nWell if it's somebody that say on their radar already like from from the past maybe at somebody who's a you know filled with the you know explosive materials or some type of chemicals or or or you know devices you know a ... and so on they might be on the radar even\nThough they didn't commit a crime so\nIf it is somebody that they tip their hand that\nThey know what they're doing then that could reveal too I suspect out there that are that they're hot on the trail so uh you know whether this this could be somebody that does know what they're doing and decide they don't want to kill anybody but they want to send a message it could be an amateur\nIt could be a number of different things and so we we were unfortunately going to have to remain a little patient um because there there are a number of things about this case you know we're we're dealing with ten devices here\nThose are a lot of devices and then they all seem to be fairly similar just based on you know the you know well what I'm hearing so it it's a matter of you know there's going to be more detail that come out that will really give us a better signal is what's going on\nAwesome Steve thank you so much free time\nAnytime you better be Gomez their former special agent with the FBI or right here in Los Angeles now uh this is going to continue and is he said you know we got to have patience with all of this they\nReferred to all of these devices having been sent down to Quantico a where the FBI will use all of this resources to try to figure out who's doing\nThis but uh um yes going to be an interesting couple of days finding out who is responsible for this\nAll right we've got tech kept coming up with mark Saltsman let's see here oh also baby octopus is\nIs if I didn't know there was a thing I guess that's the thing is there has to be looking at how she\nIs and that's not yes it is now that we said no animals today or is that just on Twitter ... we did we say that she said pets Gary said at oh I\nWas going to send us pictures of your pets ah um we'll also get into that volcano stories I have some terrifying statistics about ... nose in California right or wrong and wait for that either may
