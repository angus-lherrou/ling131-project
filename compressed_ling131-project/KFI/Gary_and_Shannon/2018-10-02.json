I'm only always KTLA five\nNever give away free to do matter how tiny bit by bit abducted every every week or two to six\n\nBy ear and out back Rio's were finished show with a rod pile cool space news piled books dot com\n... books dot com and the part cast your KFI am six forty and the key word is cool space news or write a rod I'd argue prime Amazon member by the way oh good lord yeah oh so am I right so if I ah I\nYou can get a rocket\nUp from blue origin including free shipping on sale days or here's an interesting story that you send me United launch alliance which is the bowling Lockheed a ... you will the partnership\nA which bills huge rockets is now for the next generation Vulcan rockets buying the rocket from Jeff Foxworthy's those company blue origin now here's my question this is like Ford or buying a car from Chevy and then selling it as a Ford do I have that right\nWell ... it's it's like if Ford didn't build their own engines the buying a Chevy three fifty for their rockets or for their car so you really have never built their own engines they've always bought from older aerospace or the old guard aerospace companies like ... ... rockets on and so forth\nAnd urgent rocket died in a couple of other companies Pratt Whitney which are now all combined used to build all the U.S rocketed does they build up for the tightened the bill for the Saturn five and so on and so on\nAnd then here comes these new company SpaceX and blue origin both starting around two thousand year two thousand let's say you know we're going to develop our own rocket engines on our own money so you know we'll let you know in reading and you can decided we want to buy or not\nAnd the remarkable thing is that it never happened before all these earthquake now these were were just grabbing money by the billions off the government to do these developments in the military somebody's private guys come along as we've talked about many times building their rockets but now to go ahead and show that technology with their competitors\nIs really pretty remarkable this uh this engine that that you really vying for the Balkan replaces the Russian rocket and they've been using which Congress ordered them to stop doing after the Crimean invasion and uh\nOr Ukraine excuse me and um they're the largest rocket engines built since the Saturn five\nSo I usually it this is the part that a ... I I I look at night I question because I just don't know how much of an walking is the rocket outside of the engine\nI mean as a percentage or I think of a rocket basically is an engine with some little bit of software and some odd you've got some tubes et cetera and so uh where am\nI wrong on this one well there there's a lot of mess in that hole and then I was light as possible Scott whole you've got your tanks you got a the turbo pumps are usually part of the rocket engine but you're right you've got all kinds of tank engine all kinds of tubing\nI'm so that the rocket engine isn't a huge part of the mass but most let masses fuels only like Ninety percent of the rockets way when the taking off as fuel of course that lessons as it leaves the ground because it burns up so much for taking off\nI Would think it'd be the other way then I that the folks who make the engine would manufacture the rocket because they're already Ninety percent of the way there\nWas a good point and boards it is made it factor rocket they've got their little uh the new shepherd which is their passenger rocket they're going to be hopefully starting to play next year but the big one of the uh the new arm the new Glenn which is they're\nThey're a talking heavy class rocket that they're going to start testing they hope next year which interestingly also use of this be eat four engine so new Glenn in bulk and we'll start competing about the same time we're talking heavy\nOr in the next couple of years and so we've got three companies using the engines to companies trying to set up payloads where everybody on the planet so it's going to be a very interesting to watch so widely market forces take place in this industry\nYeah so what is the end of the Russians now have a monopoly of sending a mint up to the space station and they charge a just a God awful fortune for anybody to go up when are they going to have true competition where this rockets will they be able to put up men and women now\nOn the space station\nWell we're supposed to start doing that next year so this was supposed to start happening under a contract with NASA blue or or uh gives me space X and you're all a Boeing ... were both going to send\nAstronauts up to the space station within a couple of years that was back in twenty twelve so now we passed the guidelines by many years partly because Congress kept under funding the project that part of us just because things go slower than expect so they both expect to start flying next year and hopefully that'll be regular thing because\nI think now eighty five million dollars per seat craft or not for us to pay the Russians to blast not to the space station we pay the bill which doesn't seem right now\nUh yeah I mean it's a rather astronomical so I I'll bet you they're probably going to drop rather dramatically once there's someone else up there All right a rock thank you very much always a pleasure I really care a ride or piled books dot com and a pod cast is Rhonda\nPile a news or ride or excuse me cool\nSpace news on the cash out and do what they all I'm doing All right it's um I didn't get a lot of sleep\nLast night where did you do last night he disappeared and I ...

old\nAnd they were smoking cigars in my car so when I got it back there's a cigar but like in the back seat on the floor and it just you don't get that smell out and it's a weird feeling of a feeling

he poured those beers on him last night ... true\nOr not true um there is a security system and it did alert leagues entourage to the burglary they're the ones who called police but by the time police

briefing by the FBI at least twenty four hours before an initial procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination any idea\nHow public or private that is I Do not have an idea because I'm curious to know if it's just going to be privy to the people at a ... on the Senate Judiciary committee or if it will be released to the Senate if it's released to the Senate and you have a hundred opportunities for leaking I'm\nCurious to know how much of that we will see a and if it changes at all what we know about the allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nI'm sure we'll hear about all of it at great detail if we're hearing about how Brett Kavanaugh may or may not have thrown ice it somebody in Nineteen eighty five at a bar in New haven\nI'm sure we'll find out how the vote goes down it just seems like we're getting more details than we ever have before now in terms of what's going on in an FBI investigation as ... as it's happening\nGood or bad I don't think it's good but I don't think so it All right so a Molly Ringwald only Ringwald was in fourteen thousand movies in the Nineteen eighties which was a lot she's very busy\nShe says that in a recent interview she was watching a breakfast club or sorry she was watching sixteen candles with her daughter\nAnd that they\nNow look at this movie very different lens not only she as a mother her daughter didn't get some of the you know more sexual aspects of sixteen candles the other one that ah the one that immediately came to mind about watching the movie was uh was breakfast club yeah and\nWe watched breakfast club with our kids a couple of years ago but we watch the TV version of it how different is that well what do they leave out well the pot part ... ... well they don't\nSpecifically showed the pot there just show the smoke in the room and it comes out so but there was one specific scene in breakfast club where\nBender the bad boy is hiding under the desk [laughter] oh yeah and he looks up her skirt yes Molly Ringwald so she was watching that scene with her daughter\nAnd she wasn't it's ... you don't see it happen but the implication is that he touches her or something under the skirt whatever\nIs she a bit like yeah that's right that's right so that part of it was not in the movie or should not have a TV movie or TV version of it is a much more\nPrudish look about what's going on\nThis was Nineteen eighty four this was around the same time\nThat Brett Kavanaugh was maybe taking a what he wanted the way a judge ... is it ... it wasn't the actor's name was was taking what he wanted from uh his his female colleagues their classmate well I mean she is that is that\nSaying that in Nineteen eighty four that was kind of okay to go and reach under a girl's skirt and and detention\nI Would say it this way culture changes constantly yes it may not be as fast as people want it to be but culture changes constantly so if for example she wrote an essay back of a New Yorker back in April ...\nShe used sort of the hash tag me to lens to look back at some of the movies that she was in ... you may is what I'm\nTalking about we're applying culture today retroactively right and I think that's where people are getting into trouble and well case\nAnd movies in the forties and fifties where SARS could slap their wife around or something because she's being hysterical you need a good smack on the side of the face woman\nIt's a very ... and looking at it today you know using our lens today movies like that and I in the fifties totally not acceptable\nBut more of a reflection of what was going on the culture at the time right so it's almost I I get I mean she's saying listen at the time she was Fifteen sixteen Seventeen years old and probably had to basically leave it up to John's used to determine whether something was appropriate or not\nAnd she talks about specifically in sixteen candles\nWere Caroline her character gets blackout drunk and sleeps with a nerd ... sorry that the character Caroline not her character but the the character sleeps with Anthony Michael hall\nAnd then when Jake the heartthrob in the movie so that he could violate or ten uh ten different ways if he wanted to do because she was passed out oh I forgot that line so I mean there's a there's\nWell and that and the thing is is when those were written they weren't trying to be like funny or\nIronic or dirty it was just like a matter of fact yeah kind of just a something you said like if you said and I have a new car and I could violate her ten times in ten different ways\nThey probably would've okay All right\nUm is it ... I mean it's clearly okay for her to do this and to have this attitude about it and know that when she says something to her daughter I mean right a perfect teaching moment for her to tell her daughter listen these were made back at a\nTime when that was okay to laugh about and it wasn't taken very seriously but it could very seriously impact someone's life she said that she experienced a slew of harassment off screen\n\nFrom plenty of Harvey so I think was the words that she chose the phrase though interest Lenny of Harvey's but not Harvey Weinstein she said she never had a run in with him but there there were plenty of producers or who use that same tactic on\nSixteen candles the breakfast club pretty in pink those are her big throws trait that trio yeah\n[noise] [noise]
