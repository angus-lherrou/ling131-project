{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "[noise]\nI Love the Beatles or why\nOh yeah All right bye handle here as we finished the show and of course following a hurricane Michael hundred and fifty miles an hour stain wins now or yeah I think it's just about the category five alright I dean sharp house whisper and we're talking about the secrets of finding the right contract the secrets\nWe just had to do that now we have good on a unprepared the music out boy that was my that was spontaneous [laughter]\nSo this is what I Want to talk to you about a ... and like I said at\nLast segment the entire list of the secrets of finding the right contractors up on the cafe website or just search for keyword Homer dean sharp you'll find it there\nI Want to talk about what is not on anybody else's how to ... a shop for a contractor less because you if you look on any builder website you're going to find the same stuff or check the California state license and check for their bonding and their insurance ... fine yeah OK\nThe real essence of contracting and getting your remodeled done in your relationship with your contractor is a very highly subjective experience it really really is this is not a science\nOr their science involved but it's an art form and it's a project in which human beings need to communicate with each other so I'm In a overemphasize the idea that\nWhen you are meeting with prospective contractors you really need to ask the kind of questions that you get satisfied on not just a business level\nBut on the level of are they really listening to me are they\nSaying things that are worth listening to do they speak English what's the catch which very few of them do today what is the chemistry between us because you know the smallest of remodeled projects Oregon is going to last weeks and weeks these people are in your home or the larger ones are going to go months and so\nYou know I always say you know a journey you know you get on a ship and you take a journey somewhere where you're not exactly sure where you're going it's gonna be an adventure but that adventure bring stress and anxiety\nAnd and you're kinda stuck on that boat in your experience through those stresses in anxieties and storms and unexpected things has everything to do with your relationship with the crew that makes sense that really does and here's Southern California I think the number one question what part of Israel do come from [laughter]\nYou know you just keep going\nThere [laughter] it's not\nTrue no snow ... Ninety percent of the contractors out\nThere speak with an Israeli accent but that Southern California uh but you're right that's not true [laughter] for the most part they're just it's a lot of truth here's one of the most important things\nEverybody kind of assumes oh I should probably check their references in other words he I think that's a crock check because they're only going to give you the good the good stuff OK but still he so here's the thing yeah you're going to get a list of projects they've done right and called these people this is the key question here's where the secrets\nI Want to know I Want the name and the number of the project they are on right now right now or last week or ... I I Want recent\nReferrals and I'll tell you why it's not just about a four going their ability to pick and choose who you talk to\nBut even a really good contractor here's here's where it gets personal for me even a really good contractor you know most contractors are small businesses they're not big corporations out there and small businesses are very subject to especially passionate ones are very subject to the weather uh and changing life circumstances\nI was a really good builder I still am a good builder but back when I was contracting I was a really good contractor\nBut some twenty four twenty five years ago I went through a really rough personal time an unexpected unwanted divorce and my life got turned upside down and I was finding it hard to drag myself out of bed every morning emotionally but the whole business was me right and so there was a brief period of time\nWhen I was not a good contractor I had clients and I had things I needed to fulfill and they weren't getting done and also on what it is you know you'd never be hired well the\nIs is these are I'm not saying you don't want to hire somebody whose life is just a disaster prominently but what I Am saying is for the client for the client if you're hiring a contractor\nIt's not just about the work they did ten years ago or five years ago it's about how are things now and that may seem a bit intrusive but you know what this is a job interview and ... and the question is\nAre things good right now or thinks because you're going to be handing this person a lot of responsibility they're going to tear your house open and the surgeon who rips open the patient you don't want to find out that they're having some emotional issues right now and they may not be here for two or three weeks you go out and visit the job site absolutely\nAbsolutely and and so I guess the lesson is\nDon't be afraid to get personal don't be afraid to figure out exactly where things get a feel on where this person is today end to whatever degree you want success in your project get nosy go look at don't trust and don't even even if the referral came from\nFriend don't trust your friends definition of craftsmanship\nYou can look yourself how about the number of jobs that the contractor currently has there's a big difference between a small contractors doing two or three jobs and a contractor who is doing Fifteen jobs just write different kinds of ... right when do you suggest\nWell it doesn't matter to me I don't care if ... if the company's huge\nOr if the company is small what I care about is the question of who and this is a question that never gets asked enough who's going to be supervising my project and Ken I meet them got it okay you may meet with a sales rep of a large company or you may meet with the contract who's actually going to be there eight hours a day\nEither way I Want to meet the person who will be on my project everyday representing your company taking care of supervision that's who I Want to know if I've got chemistry with alright guy and you can talk about this on Sunday Sunday we are preempted by the chargers but we will have a show running on the

his movies were what tormented my childhood whether it was children of the corn ah Christine carry pet cemetery\nAnd they don't hold up the way they the dining they would they you know what they do because they put me back in the shoes of like a nine year old and it was terrifying but I'm like Malik I still terrorizes me\nUm but pet cemetery was one of those books that I couldn't get through because it was so terrifying\nMore terrifying than the movie in the movie was scary as hell but that book I had to put it down and I never picked it back up I never reached an age where I wanted to revisit that horror\nThat's funny but you saw the trailer\nYeah I saw the trailer and it didn't really a rarified me strange yeah I bet if I saw the trailer of the original movie it would terrify me

season oh you're excited well I Love a Marty and windy bird uh I ... they've done such a great job with making that into a dark comedy\nYeah you know when I ah I haven't picked that back up and maybe I Will when I'm traveling this week um because it's kind of depressing\nA little bit yeah I Wonder if you watch this is not dead today\nMonica I think you'll get it right there is no emotional release a first from those are well you know there's there's always tension yes whatever whatever situation I find that very often and that's a\nBetter a that's a better description sounded like there is anxiety connected to Ozark\nAnxiety and tension where you you think you know that they're doing their best to make sure that they get out from under this ridiculous wait it's on their shoulders of laundering money for a drug cartel that could kill them at any moment\nAnd just when you think something great is going to happen for them or they're going to be able to get away with something something else comes down upon them so it's a a it is a\nVery difficult thing to watch but it it and to say that there's humor in that may sound ridiculous but there is in Jason Bateman does a great job and he directs a handful of those episodes to oh does it yeah yeah I Know he directed they think at least the first two episodes of ... of season too and I know he did some in season one\nWell I
