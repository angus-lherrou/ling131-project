{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "And a mayor Garcetti I was on Conway shows last night check occupied cast also we already have some new Instagram sweaters\nOn social media every day we put some new ones up and died today is no exception so good wet bill handle show on a all social media Facebook cetera\nPart right now I I I Love doing Mormon stories I find a Mormon religion so spectacular now you know I'm not a big fan of organized religion matter of fact I'm not a big fan of on organized religion but there are certain religions out I think just are particularly interesting\nThe Mormon is being one of them so\nAh here's what just happened now keep in mind uh that uh Russell Nelson who became president of the church in January and it's a hundred and Thirty years old I mean one thing about uh the heads of the Mormon church their old I mean seriously old and I don't know how long they last\nLike a it's a it's a good thing to be ah the profit or because you end up by living forever or damn close to it anyway a Russell Nelson so\nHe's the one that said uh uh we're no longer known as a Mormon sets off the table now I now you can only referred to was as members of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints\nWhich is fair it's a mouthful so what's to this why don't we called them ... for short what do you think\nYeah it works for me to\n... here's what he has asked to you you women folk Mormon women folk to do and there's a quote now\nI invite you to participate in a ten day fast from social media and from any other media that brings negative negative in impure thoughts to your mind alright whenever there was a religious leader that talks to you about impure thoughts man you're on a whole different trips\nOr he addressed the women only session of the church is general conferences past Saturday\nPrey to know which influences to remove\nDuring your fast the effect of your ten day fast may surprise you\nWhat do you notice after taking a break from perspectives of the world that have been wounding your spirit is there a change in where are you now want to spend your time and energy\nHave any of your priorities shifted just a little right so uh that is a statement that normally would just be considered kind of bizarre I mean you know it's weird you know it's a religious leader however asking women to abstain from using social media for ten days\nJust before this election and in the middle of the aftermath of the me too movement or the beginning of the me too movement now you have politics being thrown into this why would he do that why would he want women\nNot to engage in social networking\nWhen\nThis is the year of a woman and a major way\nWhere the politics women are extraordinary where women are running for office and today you cannot run for office without engaging in massive amounts of social networking I mean that's really where it sat today\nAre we're moving away from broadcast to the social media advertising connection to people more and more certainly in the ... well in the way of everything the way of commerce and the way of retail ... ah the way of entertainment and the way of\nPolitics so ah he is saying get off of it\nNow\nThere are a couple of people that are running for Congress a couple of women folk who are running that are paying attention to this is for profit says stay off the media we stay off the media\nAnd I go but\nYou're running for government you're running for a governmental pose how do you stay off for ten\nDays I guess you have your surrogates do it for you and you don't come out with any post a lot of question if you don't do it in someone else's rights it for you pretending issues that are still technically you not doing this\nA really I really don't know now\nOr the founder of Mormon women no longer morning a Mormon women for ethical government or Charlene Mullen's Glenn who uh is engaged in Syria's political activism\nLeading up to the election says that she thinks that Nelson the profit is not intending to disrupt the campaign season she says I see absolutely no insidious\nUlterior ulterior motives in President Nelson's invitation to women of the church to participate in a ten day fast from social media\nHe says I agree the time he was unfortunate\nAnd could look suspicious to those predisposed to cynicism really ... but the truth is that these general conference talks are prepared weeks sometimes months in advance\nShe sent an email to the post wait a minute what are you emailing email right you're supposed to stay off a social media what are you doing ah so Glenn said she's going to do her own fast after the midterms\nOver the Thanksgiving holiday\nA which is interesting because uh if you're engaged politically and somehow you want to influence the mid term elections are being ... was a member or a head of a political activist group why would you do that\nHowever she's doing that a\nMuch as the detractors would like to insinuate otherwise I'm convinced the intent here is not to silence women fair enough\nYou know even if the intent is about to silence women I'll get I'll give it to wrestle okay I'll give it to them what they call the guy profit president diving is president\nThe grand ... of the Mormon church is that it All right so ah I'll give it the fact that Nelson the grand ... is not doing this to shut women up in a start insidious and it's got to stop them from going into politics or dealing with politics\nBut what is the facto happening\nWhat is the outcome of course he's at the ... excuse me asking women to refrain from engaging in social media and it is an interesting time it really is that ah he would do that\nAnd in recent weeks and so that we the the number of women that have come into Facebook and Twitter and Instagram or the in the pleased to hash tag believe women this was after the cabinet affair\nAnd women are flooding social media and just in the middle of that President grand ...\nA ...

connected\nWell that certainly the or the focus of all of the law enforcement attention right now when we broke the story last week that this burglar was wanted for this series of very unusual break ins around the Malibu Kenyan area in which really only food had been stolen from of various different buildings over recent months\nOr the or the concern was that this guy\nMight be living out in the wilderness breaking into places to survive to feed himself\nAnd it wasn't really until a burglary on the morning of September thirtieth at the intersection of last version is road and Mulholland Highway that are really intensified the the attention on this because during that break in and this is the subject of the story we broke last week on Tuesday\nThey had the security video from the break in that showed that the burglar was dressed in what looked like tactical style clothing his whole face covered except for his eyes and he was wearing a headline ... and he had a rifle or long gun slung over his left shoulder\nA and the images are kind of chilling are up on the NBC for websites are there up on Twitter that I mean this guy looks like a ... what people worry might be breaking into their homes in the middle of the night\nAnd it was the image of that gun that really got homicide detectives interested because first of all most burglars are armed\nUm second if they are armed they're usually carrying something that's more conceivable than a a rifles slung over their shoulder and in this case they did some analysis of the photos and the security images and were able to see that there was some\nLet's call it similarity between the gun he was carrying\nAnd possibly a gun that was used in both the shooting death of trust in Miller the ... the ah the camp or who was killed in June\nWhile he was sleeping with his two and four year old daughters and also possibly some of what they've described as random shootings in Malibu Kenyan area over the last year or so I Apologize

Malibu Creek\nA campground where boat that was shot to death in June I hesitate to call it a murder or even though it is a crime that a boat that was killed\nIf not entirely clear that the person who pulled the trigger was aiming at any allies there's I should've said homicide well yeah because the whole first of all the whole circumstance\nSurrounding these random shootings are very peculiar that over the last year or so there have been different types of incidents all reported in the same area in\nWhich there have been vandalism shootings there have been what looked like pot shots taken at cars driving down last version is and uh and then into the horribly tragic case of Bo dead or a killing he was asleep inside his tent with his two and four year old daughter's beside him\nPeople have

with the storm officially to we've heard as high as\nFive or people who may have been killed as Michael rolled through the Florida Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia in the Carolinas\nUm we're also keeping an eye on the story and we'll talk more about it in string science at the bottom of next hour the story about the uh the launch of a Russian rocket was supposed to take an American astronaut rushing Cosby not up to the international space station but soon after it launched there was a problem and they had to get into the escape capsule\nOr use the uh\nThe escape pod but they're basically already and and come back to earth and they don't splash\nDown in Russian a Russian rocket launchers they don't they don't take them out to the Pacific ocean land them\nLess violently it's

all going [laughter]\n[noise]\nI Want to get some fortune out all the way the president's I'm outside it was very fun scheduled for today did make some comments about hurricane Michael not too long ago\nYou man first responders or on the ground [noise] and we have teams currently conducting search and rescue missions by the way the coast guard has been incredible they've saved many lives we will do everything in our power to help those in need\nAnd we will not rest or waiver until the job is done and the recovery is complete\nWhen you think about it this is still a there are still people in the Carolinas for example dealing with the effects of Hurricane Florence and had to deal with this over the last twenty four hours so I'm we'll keep an eye of the president has um that's the most that we've heard today about any updates that he has gotten was the statement that he made not too long ago\nMillennia Trump I sat down with Tom ... from ABC News to do a wide ranging interview and she says in his interview that she has told her husband that there have been people in his administration that she doesn't trust people who have worked for him she also says in this interview that ... doesn't like Jared\nI don't know I doubt it may uh she also says that\nShe believes she is one of those bullied people in the world\nI could say I'm the most ... percent on on the world usage you the most bully personal Ronald Ronald with them if you see what people are saying about\n[noise] uh\nI couldn't agree with that person you are going to get bullied and specifically vet public person I mean I don't know if she's bullied more than other Republican people though I Would I Would\nArgue with third term bullied though I don't I don't know if that would describe I mean I Know she's\n... she's criticized a lot of people say she should stand up to her husband or she should never have been with the guy or but it won't ever but only\nKind of didn't know somebody who has kind of power over you through their due to intimidate yeah something of that nature\nAnd I don't know about that but I I she definitely one of the most criticized people that's for sure uh but here's the the here's a comment about not trusting somebody\nHe's been in office now almost two years has he had people that you didn't trust\nWorking for him yeah did you let him know and and what did you do [noise] ah some people they don't learn that anymore\n[noise] should I got fired those tools there [laughter] there's a a there is a fascination I think with public um couples like this we are talking yesterday about the\nThe relationship between bill and Hillary Clinton and it's I think it's a lot uh it's something that a lot of people don't\nUnderstand the relationship between those two people\nThis is another one where there are people who just don't get the relationship between Donald ... and and they never will the thing is we don't know what goes on in their private time she said that you talk to him about it what are those conversations sound like we ... we don't see them being very few of being a close to each other\nEven ... even Hillary and bill would have conversations about stuff where they would lean over and\nHere's the thing I scheming but I don't know the best way to describe\nIt here's the thing I think bill and Hillary have a lot of shared interests I think that they are intellectually I at the same point I don't see\nMillennia and Donald Trump having a lot of shared interests I see\nA you know to people who probably wouldn't be friends if they're if they weren't married I think bill and Hillary probably be in the same circles\nYeah maybe that's the better way to describe it just said their their relationship appears different\nUh Brett Kavanaugh is on I I Am a good person tour he is feeding the homeless on the streets of Washington DC well you've done this before this isn't ... he's not I mean it doesn't hurt a second time hurt and he's been photographed handing out food to homeless\nIn your home and then we got rid of the mental health Institute in the eighties and nineties and the prisoner rapes\nJust shot up now you have shot Iraq what people called ... which is actually are a murder rate is going down by twenty percent every year I just talked to the superintendent that with Microsoft Access wrong wrong or right hand man so uh I think it's the ratings were really that helps you\nSee this game called life you know they try to scare me to not ready to have my own friends but it's had it gives me it gives me the power in a way\nMhm he credited Trump with preventing a war with North Korea and encourage Trump to swap his air force one for a hydrogen powered plane\nI brought a gift with me right here\nI'm this right here is\nThat I play in the one [noise] is a high\nA airplane and this\nIs what our president to fly and look at this year [laughter] get rid of it [laughter]\nWhat we're going to have apple America company worked one that's fine with but you know what I don't like about\nAm ... and what I Need\nThe liberals improve on as if he was good we don't look good this is\nTo beat up fresh just the flyers the fly planes the ...\nOur core ... and power\nJobs into America because\nIs entertainment of ideas but when we make everything in China and not America that were cheating on our country\n... listen they're\nUsing that word salad there are some crew tons of truth there are there are some things that he's saying that are not ridiculous but delivered by Kanye West they're ridiculous do you have the part where he talks\nAbout schools being boring yes that was one of my highlights and this is Kanye West\nI think it'd be cool to have easy id Asian centers which should be a mix of education that\nEmpowers people and gives the modern information like sometimes people say this guy has a nice to have a duty\nYou don't have ADD school is boring\nAs exciting as we have to make it more than we have to mix curriculum you play basketball while you're doing math you you did you learn about music while you meditate in the morning we have to if they mental health and art programs\nAre back into the uh back to the city\nDid you went to school yeah did you ever have a mental health program at your school\nNo no you did have arts program so you'd like band and stuff like that or sure now that I agree with that I think\nYou can make a point that a lot of schools are cutting the arts out because of budgetary exactly meant that that's what I've done the whole basketball well you're learning math I don't know how that's going to work out what this how about you play basketball and keep score that's math is not a\nYeah based on a map I'm not saying it has to be ridiculously tough and I don't think Kanye West is either\nWell kids need to learn algebra 'em and you can't do that when you're playing basketball and I think ... nice\nTo have such an interesting relationship it got a ... for the reporters in the room it probably got the most crazy when ... stood up and gave the president of ...\nBut I don't want to say I don't want to put you in this [laughter] I Love this guy I mean\nI Love this guy right there\n[noise] uh and that's my friend didn't want to put in that position\nWhere I live in an old man I can\nSort of special people [laughter] he's on the other bees to the other person in the room I mean outside of the dozens of reporters I'm an NFL hall of famer Jim Brown was there as well\nJim Brown and say anything yeah I mean he wasn't going that's not Jim Brown no no I'm\nUh he just sat there still are wild ...\nBarked up information on the resolute desk like\nOne of the reporters did ask them you know well he you know the president talked about how he's ... he's all for that stop and frisk policies um and you're against that is that going to be when you talk about in the luncheon in Tanya answered and said yes we're going to talk about that and then says to the president oh sorry I didn't mean to put you on blast pro [laughter]\nThe are the most interesting thing about this is going to be the reaction to it I mean I'm\nA little stunned that this went on as long as it did the con you rented for like ten minutes before the president said a word\nAnd uh it was very hard to keep him on a on task in terms of just whatever he was talking about or what he was there to talk about what the president\nBut the response on MSNBC right after this thing wrapped up and they cut and escorted the reporters out of the room this was from MSNBC seconds after this thing ended with the at the president and Kanye West today\nWhile I'm doing this for everybody who is watching us or turn the volume down he's waving their hands that I think ...\nA thoughtful play by play and political and now says you're not because that was in his fault on our White House\nWe're not we're not really worth the allies some of that stuff that was that um as we want to do with the top a little bit of profanity we there was actually more than you heard we we were able to bleach some of it out\nBecause there was a lot of preventive there wasn't enough in their ... and ... dropping an M. F. in the oval office or the first time but it's the first time live on television\nI mean it was so at one point there's there's cameras everywhere and one point ... grabs a stone 'cause he wants to show the president's something and he's unlocking it and his pass code is zero zero zero zero zero zero\nAnd the Internet seems to explode that\nWhen he was showing him the [laughter] the picture of the hydrogen plane you'd I saw this one thing on the Internet you should totally try it\nThat's basically what that amounted to in the old days it used to be I saw Wylie\nCoyote make this invention I think I'm going to make one in my own backyard\nSo instead of apple he actually meant acne ... exactly yes an apple I don't know if they'd gotten into the uh to the plane business yet have they\nYeah
