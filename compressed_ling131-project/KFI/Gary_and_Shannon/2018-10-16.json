never give away free to matter how tiny bit by bit is happy every every month on weekdays two to six KFI\nMan down to ... billion over here on a a Tuesday Morning as we finished a show of hands yeah\nDr Jim Kenney chief of staff are elected mission hospital ER doctors for near and a gym a a topic that's near and dear to my heart and uh this is an article out of jama the journal American American metal associate Medical Association\nAnd has to do with Barry ... surgery\nAnd how could it really is for you having myself been a very satisfied customer of Barry after surgery well I Love this uh the association with patients with severe obesity on ... surgery is a good thing why would you not have been ... surgery\nAnd it is\nIt not take care of the fact you're fat I mean doesn't that sort of a contradiction right there of course you have it because you're fat [laughter]\nNo no no this is this study is looking at whether it reduces your risk of heart attack or stroke so we know that obesity is associated with a higher risk of heart attack and stroke but nobody's really proven\nYou know that that that reducing Wade through very strict surgery will reduce heart attack or stroke\nSo what they did what they looked at a high risk populations type two diabetic people with whoever they want the greater the six twenty five so they're they're real diabetics\nThey have very strict surgery and they looked at about five thousand of them they compared them to about Fifteen thousand controls and they waited to see you know what would happen and it turns out it's about sixty percent reduction in heart attacks and strokes when you have a very strict surgery and you're a diabetic\nSo that's ... that's some real a medicine and there's some real numbers there\nYeah so so we have real evidence here that that are I think it was a good theory right that are helping people that are morbidly obese we're not talking about people who you know they weigh two hundred and fifty pounds and they're five nine we're talking about you know people with a body mass index greater than you know forty which is really a significantly yeah\nAnd and so we if we can help them out by reducing their body weight and reducing their uh their dependence constantly diabetic now as well you know do they do better and in fact it turns out they do\nNow you you know and you and I talked about my ... procedure that I did a ten twelve years ago maybe even longer a by the way I had to be in my body mass\nIndex of Ninety two very few people have that and I was pretty chunky I always I I think I was at three ten three hundred ten pounds when uh I had the procedure and then I went down done nothing and then ah put about thirty pounds back on which is normal which happens to a lot of people\nAnd so and and the good news here if I'm reading this correctly is that if you're going to get a a if you're going to get a bit Barry after surgery do it with a ruin why uh because that's the Cadillac of all of them and that's that was when I was told that's what happened in this study seems to point that out\n[noise] well okay so in this study Seventy Seventy five percent of the people who have a procedure have the ruin why procedure but the other twenty five percent had either the ah but what they call it flea bath directed me or or just an adjustable band [laughter]\nUm but so yeah the majority of people making up this study has been more aggressive procedure and that is so so for people you know that's the most aggressive procedure it's a very you know involves surgery and it really does involve permanently bypassing and removing a section of your stomach\nAs opposed to like uh adjustable gastric banning where you can literally go in and and in a few minutes you know put this thing in place and if ... if you have any problems that can be removed so\nYou know again you do get better effects or you no longer lasting effects from the more complicated surgery but it has higher risk as well [noise]\nYeah All right fair enough follow I mean we talked\nAbout this before you went in at the time you went in the complication rate what what do we say it was it was like a two percent chance of death or something like that you know two out of a hundred that's it it it was a pretty scary thought when you were first going in\nA yeah and I'm assuming today is a far better uh\nI I Would assume so as well I don't know the latest numbers but I Would assume it's much better than that at this\nPoint fair enough and then finally let's finish up with a apple watches to monitor patients used by hippie nice surgeons surgeons are using apple watches explain that one to me\n[noise] okay so ... that watch goes on the patient but the surgeons are using that monitor people activity and it really makes a lot of sense right there's already people walking around with ... beds and other devices showing their steps how how much how active they are\nThe apple watch is can be a program to collect a little bit more information about how much time you're sitting and and uh how much time you're standing versus doing other activities so they're using that because that's a key component to recovering from hip and knee surgery\nAnd this is real time and it's constant information which is kind of neat\n[noise] yeah and it's more accurate information because let's face it how how many times have you gone to the doctor and he says hey how many times a week do you exercise running give them your optimum week maybe I go to the gym two or three times in reality you know the average out to one\nYeah I just lie I don't pretend to tell the truth or apple with don't lie yeah that's true and I notice that I'm not wearing an apple watch my twenty dollar time mix which I've always had All right Jim thank you sir anytime alright take your we'll talk again All right\nUh Gary county which do we do and what's new in the world of the Gary Indiana as you well the horse\nRace thing is ah is trending right now which is pretty big the president called Stormy Daniels a horse face today on Twitter of course a and called Michael ... third rate lawyer\nWhich I think it's closer to the truth than than storm you being a horse base I was probably the other on the liberties that he could have had dancing\nThat dance and it's got a horse race Sarah Jessica Parker those deals to have a horse faces plenty of other horse races out there but uh that is going to be a big issue in the president doesn't have any public event scheduled today\nSo this may be sort of be stories sitting and a boiling horse face juice for the rest of the day it's very ... especially doesn't come out and make any other statements um there's new Associated Press story out\nThat shows that the people who want to keep the gas tax in place have been coordinating with everybody I mean\nThe state actual state organizations the state transportation\nYou know they want this gas I look at the way it was written but they have ...\nWe did a story on that just the way it was really you know it's horrible it is absolutely an ally it's totally deceptive I Know and\nWe can't do anything about it except vote yes on prop six and show the secretary of state and\nYes I was I'm Sorry go ahead no I was just going to I'm just going to say that's the only thing you can do to to punch back at that so I was talking to John Thomas yeah I Know he is so about uh the polling that he didn't last week he talked about how ... was going to absolutely lose yesterday called me said there even again\nGood yeah they're ... they're they're moving in that direction is thirty five thirty five right now\nThis is I mean the idea that the state would be involved in this is frustrating because I mean the very least they should have a hands off approach to this but you know it's not going to happen and also we have Dodgers tickets were giving away tickets to tonight's game and we're giving away tickets to tomorrow night's game\nSo now it's Dodgers is a baseball team I understand that but the tickets to tonight's game that you're giving away\nHow far in what role of the parking lot are these tickets as a closer nights game yes those are the are they good tickets were given away chicken I'm just playing with you and just you know you get out and bought them you know I just know first of all I Know how this company works\nOh or start you know they're good they're good tickets also understand for the air show Europe in the air on Thursday we're working on it OK working on it but yes that's the plan\nSo you're going to go in one of the vomit comet ... yeah but I don't I'm not a throw up guy then you're going to limit that's what I understand All right we're done guys and there's plenty\nTo talk about ... and Gary have a good show thank you sir\nThe Tuesday or over six teams of course the big news locally again is going to be [noise]\nAh the brewers and the Dodgers game for six oh nine first pitch tonight because you know got a schedule your day around it all the action of course than I Am five Seventy LA sports Dodgers last last night four to nothing even though ... does your came up to the bottom of the ninth inning\nTo out [noise] bases loaded I mean that's the sort of the poet a poetic end to it if he were to be able to get something going but ended up striking out now the uh the\nBrewers you lead the series two games to one so this is\nTo say that they're not all must win games but this is kind of a should win game for the Dodgers are going to keep this thing lived a Red Sox Astros also today about two o'clock so\nWell Elizabeth Warren put out a five minute video a along with the documents to back it up trying to put to bed the controversy over her claims that she has Native American heritage this is a gamble that may not work out for her it may be the end\nInteresting that she thought this was going to help her especially as we get closer to the midterms um the she listed at Stanford University DNA researcher for her test\nAnd the the researcher says the facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native American ancestry in your pedigree\nHowever the estimates of just how much Native American blood she actually possesses just range from like one sixty fourth to one one thousand and twenty fourth right so we're going back to six to ten generations are\n... and the thing is you can't even ... that's the problem I guess or the the uh the biggest hurdle for her to overcome this is such a\nAn inexact science when it comes to this sort of a thing that she didn't really bolster her own argument here so if you will see the average American and I've seen this number fluctuate but ... but even if you take the lowest or the highest the average American has\nMore than that there should have been a call made to Native Americans the different tribes and and gotten their response or their take on it or or just their opinion because what I don't think they saw the backlash coming\nNo listen of the president made fun of her that's fine we was fully expected what was not expected was the Cherokee Nation came out the Cherokee Nation came out and
