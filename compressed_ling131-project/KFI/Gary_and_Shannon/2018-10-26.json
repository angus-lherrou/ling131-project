well a Halloween is on its way and we were just talking about the history of Halloween and Neal you did a wonderful jobs you always do and I was talking about the candy part of Halloween\nOkay so there's ... there's a Scottish custom that goes back called guy using and that's where the disguise comes from the kids dressing up and back in the day sixteenth century uh kids would go and they dress up in the seeing those songs and there was always this playful threat that if you didn't give them something sweet that there\nBe a problem over the riser there'd be some sort of mischief\nWell in the Nineteen thirties is really when a it became popular in the United states to do trick or treating and it morphed into a very brief a phrase of a trick or treat so what do you want you want to miss Jeff but it's an idle threat\nYou're going to give us something sweet you you push on a past the fifties and you get a candy makers going wait a second you know what parents are starting to go hey I don't know if I Want to send my kids out because if they get you know\nPopcorn balls or something like that we don't know if they're going to be safe and so the candy makers started coming out saying oh we can make it safe these are little individual packages you this and you know that they're sealed and you know the it came from the factory and you know it's good so all the candy manufacturing\nIt's a win out and started pushing their candy and it just became a easier and safer and it switched completely\nYeah also the um in in during my time when I was a trick or treating which I did write up through my twenties cause I like a candy and free candy on top of that is uh that we used to get to your people would buy candy in bulk\nAnd they put in two or three there were all individually wrapped the counties but they put it in fact we're already or something every day it's candy bars and it used to be a candy bar was considered the end all be all I mean you couldn't believe it I mean that has changed stand it\nI think it was that way when I was a kid to you would get the individual candies and if you scored the chocolate or a candy bar that was a good one and man if you could find that one neighbor that seemed to be rolling in it that would give out full sized candy bars out good night Irene that's when\nEverybody would uh you know the kids would whisper about it now Halloween just as a a aside bar mansion has turned into an adults\nOr adults holiday I mean now the cost of owning the party's blows away the kids part of it doesn't it\nMassive massive industry idiot it is absolutely acting it's second to Christmas\nI'm number one candy a day but second Christmas as far as spending I mean people go nuts for things like that I I there's something about the masquerade something about ah you know really\nI you know being someone else candy among all the decorations\nI mean either ... well ... nail a there are people in this world that go out of their way and create these things around the house clearly not having a life I Neal I have never seen a house that is so\nI decorated but it's so cleverly I'm going to give you a lotta kudos on this one I have you ...\nFor the past couple of years with my son max and spent time making his costumes but I Will I Will start again they'll do like\nFair this this uh this Halloween you know there's a new show all want to tell you about on on Netflix that I really love called the curious creations of a a oh I think it's Catherine McConnell um her parents\nLive in riverside now she is this brilliant\nArtist who does a baked goods and cooking and uh but very macabre in playfully Macondo well every year she does her parents' house decorate the entire puts it cost him on the house to make

he threw out here in Burbank you see people decorating and I try to but right now and focusing on on David ... yeah do I get that for your son the new cooking for Halloween special cooking\nI Do sometimes but often if we have people over like sometimes a family will come over to go trick or treating her just hanging out on the porch as we pass out candy\nUm then I order something in but sometimes usually leading up like messing around do you make a great meat loaf yes I Do on thing to do when you're having people over is um you form it free form it into a hand\nAnd at the risk you use a a core of an onion as the bone and you use a little bits of onion for the nails and you bake it off that way and it looks hitting it looks like a zombie hand they'll say something like that you can also serve\nUm if you're having lots of people over you can serve from a skeleton have a skeleton laying on the table and put your warming dishes in in the chest cavity and serve sausages\nAnd things like that on the chest cavity weird I Love doing stuff like that uh when we have parties\nAll right okay and their fight I mean for those of you know you'll never be invited of course but for

four hour newsroom an arrest has been made in the case of twelve mail bombs central several prominent Democrats many of whom have been critical of the Trump Administration\nThe suspect was arrested in the Miami area where authorities also took possession of a van they covered the vehicle with a blue tarp\nErica turkey says a man was tracked through a cell phone the guys fifty six lives in Florida and NBC News says a man\nHas ties to New York to more mail bombs were found today one was sent to CNN's offices in New York City it was addressed to James Clapper of former director of the national intelligence agency a mail bomb was also sent to New Jersey democratic senator Cory Booker was intercepted in Florida now that van\nIs plastered with stickers of President Trump vice president Pence and messages of support for the Trump Administration the white then also as photos of some people including Hillary Clinton and filmmaker Michael Moore with an image of crosshairs over their faces President Trump announced the arrest during an event hosted a young black leaders at the White House\nIs terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nHe says political violence cannot be allowed to take root in America and he's committed to doing everything it can to stop it the president says the person responsible for sending the explosive devices will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law of former overdrive are accused of raping a teenage girl in Laguna Beach has skipped out on court\nJudge knows he has issued a warrant for the man's arrest the guy's been charged with rape by use of drugs statutory rape of a minor and several other felony charges prosecutors say a Seventeen year old girl was near a bar and twenty sixteen when family called the super to take her home\nOkay also not a I mean that's just the thing it's not that that doesn't necessarily point one way or the other um the idea or\nThe idea that this guy was capable of doing this was a little surprising because we are talking out twelve twelve devices that have been\nAnybody do what he did he capable of what making something look like a bomb and then set putting it in the mailbox by ...\nI guess it's just I don't know I'm trying to I'm trying to wrap\nMy head around all of a restaurant for your your maybe it's the response that this guy that we had to take it totally seriously

just going to die why I don't play already of hours and hours [laughter]\nUh well the big story today of course as we've been following there's been a suspect arrested in Florida in connection with the suspicious packages that have been sent to Democrats all over the place a guy who was apparently a President Trump supporter has a a a\nFan that have been taken away by the FBI covered covered in at least the windows were covered in stickers and a pro Republican stickers pro Trump stickers and then\nHad pictures of prominent Democrats and liberals like Michael Moore with targets over their faces this guy's been in trouble before and has made threats before so are people who live in Florida at least in ...\nFlorida they they they know this guy you I'm so he's going to be in be talking to some FBI agents for a few hours I Would assume\nTold you the story about Lauren McCluskey Twenty one year old student at the University of Utah had been dating a guy named Melvin Roland well Melvin had lied to learn about his age about his name about his criminal background\nAnd when she found out she broke things off that had been about a month that they were dating she broke things off\nAnd he was having none of it\nAnd he had been lurking on campus for days trying to confront Lauren and and the hours before he shot and killed her he was in her dorm socializing with her friends a master manipulator\nShe broke it off with Melvin um\nAfter her month long relationship she filed a complaint with campus police saying that he had demanded money in exchange for not postings some of the compromise compromising pictures of the two of them on line\nAnd she spent about a thousand dollars a I guess she sent a thousand dollars to an account in hopes that that would not have come up\nSo they were investigating investigating these cases sexual extortion or they knew that he was a sex offender but not that he was on parole\nAnd she said\nTo campus police that she had received numerous emails and messages\nAll from different names trying to lure her to locations and investigators now believe they all came from this guy\n\nA after he shot her\nMelvin was picked up on campus by women that he met online they went to dinner they visited the state capital they went to her apartment were rolling took a shower imagine\nThat later that night she drops them off at a coffee shop that's where police eventually found him chased him basically to a church where he had broken in and uh and shot himself\nApparently he got the gun\nBy telling an acquaintance that his girlfriend wanted to learn to shoot ... so that's why\nAll right I don't um can I called the U.S on that I mean who lends their gun to someone who says I Want to teach that person to shoot\nI think it happens probably a lot that I think it probably happens a lot on the Utah department of corrections 'cause remember this guy was on parole they were not alerted to the complaint filed by Lauren with the campus police with the University of Utah\n[noise] the\nThe president at the University of Utah said outside investigations being launched two assessing campus security and police protocols to determine if improvements can be made to prevent future shootings okay I don't know much I haven't gone through the crime stats for the University of Utah I Can't imagine that shootings or a massive problem there yes this happened here what\nWas one there\nWithin the year or two\nBut ... but the thing is this is a this was\nSomething that fell through the cracks when she originally filed a complaint with police saying that she was being exported\nAll they had to do was look into this guy's background now grant was using a fake name and we've found that out since but but I mean is it a detective work that needs to be done\nI don't mean to put down campus police but you know how ... at least when I was in school campus police's like police light if I was truly afraid I Would have gone to Chico PD not Chico University of Chico pulled campus police right but you know I'm not folding her obviously it's just\nYou know they're not the most on top of it\nI don't think they are they not as much so is the local police department all this stuff to talk of the family\nYou're a now he was paroled in April when he told the parole board that he was a change to man after being appear leader in prison and\nUh that that it helps them tap into his empathy and learn to follow rules he spent nearly ten years in prison after he pleaded guilty and two thousand four to trying to learn under age girl on line as well as attempted sex abuse charges\nAfter he was charged in that case a woman came forward to report he had sexually assaulted her after meeting on line a few days earlier it seems like the kind of guy that was just meeting girls on line being whoever they wanted him to be to get whatever he wanted from them ...\nWas the was the key thing that he was capable of and it's a I don't know if ironic is the right word but it's amazing that the parole board knowing that for years he was described as manipulative\nWe've been manipulated into letting this guy go\nOkay we need you to tell us your stories we've got a story here about Disneyland slash Disney World and the big secret involving ashes cool places you have scattered ashes\nRight yeah what's\nWrong well I was thinking maybe cool places that you want your ashes scattered also oh yeah that's great that's a good one\nAnd if you have do you write it already loaded and an F. sixteen [noise] know that'd be a little messy because they don't like foreign objects in their dinner like debris floating around the six teams\nWould you like them to be scattered from an F. sixteen ooh different that's very different I think I just hit the nail on the head gear and general continue right after this\nPaul Hi [laughter] how old are you kidding me yet that kind of joy and your life when a thousand dollars on your next shot happens within twenty minutes\nK pacify the central in orange county and I are radio station [noise]\nThey say they got their guy time Chris little live from the KFI twenty four hour news room a man in his fifties has been arrested in Florida in connection with the explosive devices into some lawmakers and other high profile Democrats\nCaesar say I was arrested near Miami and we'll make it a new show court appearance there but we're told the Florida Man will eventually be transferred here to New York where his case will be handled by federal prosecutors in Manhattan\nErik ... has a history of arrest the was said to be tracked in part by way of his cell phone or white van has been impounded some of the windows were covered with stickers supporting President Trump and criticizing CNN [noise]\nThe news outlet also got a suspicious package this week President Trump has praised law enforcement for the quick working catching say walk the president spoke of\nOh the arrest today well he hosted any event for young black leaders at the White House the president says terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nWe must never allow political violence to take root in America cannot\nAnd I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nBecause anyone involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law prosecutors in Turkey I've requested the Eighteen people being held in connection with the killing of a journalist be extradited from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon says through a translator or a actually a well\nNot a translator but an interpreter that justice will be seen\nThey a crime was really painful to old Saudis ah [noise]\nIn the air but everywhere anywhere everyone does it who ask for permission\nWay I mean here's the problem do they put a tagging their county puts a tag in there and if you just dump it out there that tide comes back uh if somebody finds that tacked on call Bob yeah um I've done it tell me more three times more well we spread the remains of Julie's dads ashes\nAre in the winter circle at a local horse racing\nTrout [laughter] love it that's on now we\nKnow what did you do all of them\nOr anything like that oh the whole thing I had to sift through the ashes to make sure there was I wanted to get that take out of there yeah but what's in there also are your screws would screw because when they cremate you to cremate you in a box yeah\nAnd so I didn't want those which screws such a what screws oh you didn't want anyone to like get hurt by them or I don't I didn't care about people I didn't want the horses heads up on yeah\nUm and there was the spread some other ashes in a lake or ... in the Colorado River\nOh that's pretty yeah\nUm now that the tag that's in there it it is it the name of the deceased\nNo it's a number and how bad are fact we empty that box\nAnd left the tag in that box and put it on a shelf in uh my wife's father in law's garage and then they sold the house and that ... and that box wound up at the goodwill and that was in there and they called the county and they gave them our number and they called us and said you want the clocks back\nNow okay I'm not as you know I'm not a defense attorney but if I were to defend somebody\nThere's no way to connect you Chris little if the if you left the tag in the winner's circle there is no way to connect you to that ash dumping right they they they go back to the number of they'll find out at your loved one and then you know they could they well anybody in the family\nYeah but you have to fill out paperwork in order to have somebody cremated and so that you're tagged so it could have been anybody in the family right well\nThese these custodians current and former custodians that these Disney Parks day that the ashes of been spread\nAll over the place flower beds Bush's outside the park gauge during the fireworks displays the moat in the pirates of the Caribbean the moat underneath the Dumbo Ryan\nSaid quick guess go round here Blakey uh we don't condone\nThat says you can see I Am not not a new alluring Disneyland or a viewer ashes were to end up at Disneyland rare would you like them to end up which which part of the park [noise]\nBlake from well\nI think in a\nIn light of that we you know getting in people's faces I just think it'd be it'd

have been able to figure out about Caesar say oc\nFifty six years old he is a supporter of the president he was at least at one of the president's rallies a couple of years ago he's a amateur body builder or his online resume describes him as a businessman a promoter a booking agent for males stripper shows\nYou're going to see images [laughter] the best uh\nYou're going to see images of the fans that he was apparently I'm In right or just gotten out of right when he was arrested he was arrested outside I think about an auto parts store it's a big white van a and the windows on the van were covered with these stickers and it's everything from\nA images of President Trump vice president Panthers American flags all over the place logos of the Republican National committee I'm a logo for a Native Americans for Trump and then something like\nYouth soccer recruits for Trump yes there was a that was the weirdest one of all I but then you've got other weird propaganda style stickers\nAnd posters images of people like George Soros a Michael Moore the filmmaker Hillary Clinton with targets are superimposed over their pictures um and then of course American flag and a bunch of writing\nI mean a bunch of writing\nEspecially in those back to windows in the back door the van\nAlone should have been pulled over a month ago and it's just a rolling see something say something now he was active on social media accounts\nA lot of ... supporting Trump denigrating Democrats what you would kind of expect his past is not great court records there and Florida show he was arrested in two thousand two and he served a year of probation for a felony charge of threatening to throw replace a bomb\nWent a repeat that served a year of probation\nFor a felony charge of threatening to throw replace a bomb that doesn't seem like it's a lot of time a probation for a felony how 'bout that that's that's why uh when we say you get locked away you get a lot of chances before you actually locked away a court records available online and do you not really give any more details about the case\nMales stripper and for a less shows were expecting to learn more about the case during a

from a popular overlooked\nAnd officials here in California are criticizing the Trump administration's plan to freeze a vehicle emissions standards saying it threatens public health and the environment will check your drive coming up next June\nOf the skill capability and determination of our American law enforcement the best in the world\nSo I Am pleased to participate in this announcement that a suspect is in the custody of the FBI\nI Want to remind everyone that to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he's been charged today\nWith five federal crimes including interstate transportation of an explosive\nIllegal mailing of explosives threats against former presidents and certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers for these charges a defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison [noise]\nThese charges may a change or expand as the investigation proceeds\nThis is a law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially not political violence\nAnd so I Want to thank FBI Director ray and his team all of our law enforcement partners who are here ATF Secret Service postal inspectors Capitol police [noise] uh\nIn New York City police department and the United states attorney Berman on the southern district of New York and us attorney for the southern district of Alabama already on a or some\nFederal state and local law enforcement officers from across this country responded immediately to the cause and contributed to this effort we are proud of each one of them\nI Want to read or write to defend it in this case is innocent until proven guilty\nBut let this be a lesson to anyone regardless of their political beliefs that we will bring the full force of law against anyone who attempts to use threats intimidation and outright violence to further and a gym\nWe will find you we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law and now director right or who's done an incredible job leading this effort over the last few days he will give us the details of the day is important arrest Chris [noise]\n\nAs the attorney general as confirmed we have arrested seeds are say are\nIn connection with this investigation\nAs our investigation is still ongoing I may not be able to answer questions about his background or or about his motive what I can say is that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of the greatest imports our investigation ranged from New York\nTo Delaware to Maryland to the district of Columbia to Florida to California and as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are\nCounterterrorism division in our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico [noise]\nBut but and I really can't underscored this enough we did not act alone as you can see from the agencies and departments represented up here today [noise] a threat of this go out of this magnitude requires all of us working shoulder to shoulder\nAnd today's arrest is a testament\nTo the strength of our partnerships and what we can do when we all work together\nI Want to acknowledge the many partners who helped in recovering and transporting these IDs to our lab in Quantico this is dangerous and highly skilled specialized work\nIt requires great care and were incredibly grateful to all those who helped us in that effort and getting those devices to our lab\nFrom around the country [noise] we can confirm\nThat Thirteen I these were sent to various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material that gives off heat and energy through a reaction to heat shock or friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices I Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the FBI left [noise]\nBased on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelope containing an ID that had been sent to Congress will and Maxine Waters we have confirmed this fingerprint is that the seas are saying\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different IDs mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and Hollywood but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work\nAlso want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert every to try to keep the American people safe from harm\nAnd who moved quickly and efficiently into action every single time today's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages and transit now an other packages on\nSo we need the help of everyone out there every citizen everyone in law enforcement everyone we've got to help with this investigation in the days to come if you've got any information please call us\nOur tip line at one eight hundred call FBI or our email line tips dot FBI dot Gov\nNo piece of information is too small every tip could be the one that leads to something very important and of course if you see something suspicious suspicious activity please call your local authorities we need all hands on deck we need to say that you know\nFinally I Want to thank our partners too many to name from across the country because we cannot do this work alone everyone up here today understands that and we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together\nProtecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans now I'd like to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from the NYPD\nKFI and kale at P. H. D. to Los Angeles\nThat Chris ... every one of the men and women are the NYPD quite frankly all the people in New York City I Want to commend the thank all of our local state and federal law enforcement partners in this effort including the attorney general's office and us attorney's office for the southern district of New York\nOr in YPG detectives alone with FBI and ATF agents postal inspectors New York state police and many others they are one team on our joint terrorism task force\nThe J GPS in New York was the first of its kind in the nation it's been in business since Nineteen eighty today there are three hundred investigators from fifty six agencies hundred and Thirteen of them are in New York City cops\nWhen it comes to terrorism in New York City in YPG doesn't do anything without the FBI and the FBI doesn't do anything without the NYPD\nThat's a partnership that was forged in fire in my thirty six years in policing our relationship has never been stronger\nHis case told that story again New York city cops for a side by side with FBI agents many other agencies in Florida this morning together they brought justice as they always do\nThe wide experience of our agencies coupled with the individual expertise the members of the NYPD bomb squad or highly trained emergency service unit or intel bureau a counterterrorism bureau\nOr patrol cops were the first to respond to CNN all help lead to today's arrest I couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day we said from the outset and we would identify and arrest that person or people responsible for these acts\nIs the president I Will say that I received a very nice congratulatory call from the president shortly before heading over here\nA and saw his remarks that he made at the White House and I think he like every American is and should be proud of the unbelievable work was done not just by the FBI but by all of our law enforcement partners across multiple states\nAnd that's how they commissioner O'Neil said it well the partnerships that exist in a law enforcement profession right now in this country a are extraordinary are better than they've ever been and it's ... ... exactly what the doctor ordered for this country at this time\n\nI guess they're wrapping it up there again of the department of justice giving an update on what has been interesting it was made earlier today in this series of bombs that were mailed through um throughout the country basically at least one in\nUm at least one in California although we have found out that they are looking into a suspicious package in South Sacramento CNN also reported that they were looking at a package in Burlingame that may have been addressed to Tom's dire\nNeed biggest piece of information that came out of this press conference is that FBI Director Christopher Wray says that the more than a dozen pipe bomb sent to these people\nWere not hopes devices says each of the pipe bombs contain materials that could react and cause of potential explosion so that is the big take away that they have these things were exposed to certain heat or friction\nThat they would have been opera ... yeah they would have done something right um\nMay not have been the biggest but definitely I mean a balmy as a bomb so that's a that was an interesting way to put it because I thought it was it was very clear the other thing is and the reporters were trying to ask you know we're trying to obviously drill down on this guy's motivation was he doing this\nOn behalf of the president in his mind or on behalf of conservatives are on behalf of Republicans and safely the investigators said you know we don't give a damn we don't care that's not why we do this or not obviously that's going to be part of the investigation is did they get this guy's motivation but that doesn't change how we handle this case one iota\nYou know it's nuts though is this guy does look to be like the number one fan of the president you know everyone was talking about like oh it's it's early to say that this is a Trump supporter this guy looks to be like the number one Trump supporter I mean if you just look at his vantage just as he faces fifty eight years in prison and he's been charged with\nFive crimes including the illegal mailing of explosives and you've got to believe they are going to throw the bucket this guy\nYeah and then the FBI has said early\nBeen telling a CNN that the fingerprint possibly and DNA have tied him to these package bombs that the I mean you could get DNA from simple skin transfer it could been if those are\n... stamps you know you could do that even if it was a an adhesive stampede could potentially leaves some skin cells on the backs of those dams whatever's in the package whatever's in that bomb et cetera so plenty of different ways they could attach or they could find this guy\nBut they said that the fingerprint specifically with one of the big keys and leading them to him All right Gary and Shannon with your chance at a thousand\nDollars right now your shot at one thousand dollars now explanation why keyword bills to two hundred two hundred get affects confirming every plus I heart radio invoke standard data method rates apply in this nation wide front that staff to two hundred two hundred\nAnd again you

next hour in fact every hour through the first hour of the comedy show and we do these on the weekends as well because I live in a thousand bucks a week that'll make your Saturday or Sunday go better that's for sure Chris little got the latest\n\n\nFriday talks over twenty six point\nPeace love harmony friday's in love and harmony we uh been following this story of Iraq Today in South Florida in connection with the suspicious packages that have been sent around the country are now they're saying Thirteen packages\nBut they are also looking at a couple of others uh one up in the south Sacramento area\nI'm that there was a suspicious package address to senator ... Harris was intercepted a male sorting facility in a in the Sacramento area they were called about quarter to eight I guess it was this morning one of the postal workers spotted a package that resembled all of the others that we've been seeing a and\nThere was another report that Tom's dire\nOr the billionaire who has been a huge driver in terms of trying to impeach the president that Tom Steyer also may have had one addressed to him they are investigating that in the Burlingame area so in a south San Francisco area um that's basically the latest we heard the Justice Department update on this guy\nA nothing surprising necessarily out of this except the uh\nThe head of the FBI the director of the FBI Christopher Wray suggested that these were not hoax devices\nAre not hoax devices when again\nWe're trying to figure this out because it from a\nNon professionals perspective it doesn't look like these were very sophisticated at all that doesn't mean that they couldn't tip exploded\nAnd it doesn't really matter it's all about the intense as Brian suits pointed out yeah um and it really is and the president is upset though that this took so much coverage away from the Republican momentum in the terms\nI mean I Would stay away from this\nI don't mean to tell anybody what to do but if somebody is my number one fan and they go after a bunch of people with bombs are phoney bombs or whatever the hell it is a that I've gone after and publicly for a long time\nMaybe temper my comments on the whole situation maybe I maybe I don't read anything about all of this quote unquote bombs stuff\nYeah I I'm curious if there is going to be any sort of a comment along those lines obviously the president doesn't want this guy bombing anybody right I mean it's clear\nBut I Wonder if that has to be set I Wonder if if people are going to hold him accountable to come out and say something like listen\nYou want to support me I appreciate it you want to be a active in political circles and you want to ... I absolutely support it but the moment you cross the line and put someone's life in danger I don't want you as a supporter get off my get off my lawn kind of thing\nI mean I don't know if they'll say that and you just go down the list of things that he said about people and when it comes to James Clapper he's referred to him as a lying machine out Cory Booker of Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic party they have no future\nA Joe Biden saying a binding was weak both mentally and physically who would go down hard and fast in a fight Robert De Niro very low IQ individual\nUh yeah I Do these go down the whole the whole list at\nDebbie Wasserman shirts as shields neurotic I don't take issue with that at all\nThe time and John Brennan easily the worst CIA director in history so it's just funny to hear him now talking about what's appropriate political discourse in this country\nBecause I don't see him changing his brash nature of his comments anytime soon you know so it's okay for him to do it but not for somebody in Florida who's living in a van down by the river to get fired up by it\nWell and and it's there is a leap there that has to be taken by a crazy guy to get this I mean it's one thing to to write these things on Twitter as stupid and idiotic as they are but it's also it's another thing to then go hey you know what I think I have a good idea I'm going to go down this hit list and or send all these packages to these people it's it's ridiculous now\nThe um the other stuff that's going I Want a clock by the way around ... he's going to join us and we're going to go through a lot more of the information that we found out from the Justice Department today and this investigation\nThere's other stuff going on in DC we mentioned is a little bit yesterday the Pentagon is going to send hundreds of additional troops to the border in response to the president's vow\nTo use the military to block a caravan of immigrants that or at least making their way to the United states whether or not they'll actually make it here and how many of them will I think the the numbers have shrunk a little bit as they've made their way through Mexico\nUm Pentagon officials still have to figure out where these troops are gonna be coming from where they will be going along the border specifically and what exactly there'll be doing the image of that I think a lot of people want to portray here is\nMen and women in uniform with ... with M. sixteens standing along the border pointing it at a group of immigrants coming into the United states which is not what's going to happen to the for the most part when when the Pentagon orders National Guard troops to the border there in in a support role\nTheir mechanics and there I'm a communications specialists and their pilots and things like that that can help out but aren't necessarily the front line people that are on the border specifically defending ... you know making sure that people are coming in legal\nNevertheless these pictures will be used or when it comes to both sides adding up into the mid term\nSo I heard this today a Martha my column on Fox was interviewing pierced the Nielsen the director of homeland security\nAnd asked her ...\nAre they going to shoot people know that didn't happen and ... and you'll see it was like a ... ... no one's gonna shoot anybody although the ... you know my ... she was speaking specifically of customs and border protection ice agents\nBut I care for the public's for the safety of my officers by my agents I you know I care deeply about that so I Know we're not shooting people\nBut you can't say that you ...
