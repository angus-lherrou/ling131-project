broadcasting at the great Pacific Air show\nOr on Saturday yes Saturday the twentieth I Will be out there\nOkay and will be there are also and I and I'm broadcasting with Brian suits\nThere'll be fun you guys are both similar in the sense that you have a wealth of historic knowledge that no one else asked I just got done talking to suits about uh Neil Armstrong I was named after Neil Armstrong I don't know half the crap that he knows about it's amazing so yeah we're guy Neil Armstrong by the way\nA weird how just how he was in milked all the ... ... do you know that\nWhen a ah he was a moving the lunar lander is going over the rocks and he almost uh they told them to abort yeah ... because he was out of fuel he had thirty seconds worth of fuel when he wouldn't do it his blood pressure didn't go\nI mean the guy is just he's he's he's ice that's impressive just like you\nKnow on mice or your rice All right speaking of ice yeah talking about waste yes one of the best\nThings to do is freeze things I'm freezing them properly or the two enemies of frozen food our air and water\nSo keep that in mind whenever you're packing them up for freezing freezing is amazing it stuffs the bacterial growth slows everything down the only thing that gets damaged in the in the freezer is if you get freezer burn which is caused by air or water\nAnd that causes these little tiny little sword and ice cutters to their ice cream is horrible you know the ice cream yeah it it gets freezer burn it this is the best way I tell you open up the container you take your scoop out right and then you put the lid back on me put it in there no no no take Saran Wrap sheet of Saran Wrap\nPut it over the ice cream and presses down decree to seal on top of the ice cream then put the lid on what you won't get freezer burn anymore it's interesting it'll be just as fresh as as always you just want to press all the air out and it will seal it will now feel the ice cream is hardly ice cream creating an accent\nThat's great because we have because you know Marjorie and ice cream she's out of her mind when it comes to ice cream we buy a lot of it and ah it inevitably after a few months because she'll take little bits and pieces and we'll discover containers of ice cream in the farthest reaches of the freezer or the ...\nYou will be thrilled because you peel that thing off and we just like do underneath there get a new piece next time if you have to put it down press all the era you'll be golden that's it that's all you're doing when you're freezing as controlling those two elements now you're a big fan of the food savers right those yes I'm a huge fan they're great\nThey're great 'cause they ... they take out the air or so you'd have to compete with that and the moisture is\nUp to get any moisture is up against the actual item so it's not creating those crystals that form these nice to actually destroy the cells\nOf whatever you're eating it starts to tear it up and it makes the texture weird um they worked out great also keep in mind that eggs raw eggs UPN freeze them as a whole egg but if you track them and scrambled them a little bit you can freeze egg or in the freezer no problem\nAlways an actress so you you can use things um you know cheese freezes well uh actually cheese gets a little bit brittle\nA heads up on the on ... on on the almost yeah with the heart of cheese or sample we're big fans of a of a cheddar and so we have ... slices freeze them take 'em out and they're brittle and they fall apart so I'd argue to argue vacuum sealing them before you put the men are you putting the uh I Know we're not\nVacuum seal not will try that next year I'm a vacuum seal it up because that's the same thing I did alright Neal thank you thank you Saturday So that's tomorrow from two to five o'clock and I guess who just shown up\nA fence H O W and and the clause yes you're on your west yes oh he's do y'all Kanye coyote I already out I'm all day today con you thank you you're making fun of me no I wouldn't\nI Would never do that you know me better than that you say you say Conyers name like a a a Jewish man [laughter]\nI think it's gotten your life

about what happened to this guy\nAlso Mark Kelly is going to join us we're going to do movies in the one o'clock hour or nine news nuggets you need to know and why Fleetwood Mac should be sued\nNot

she doing a football thing yes okay but it's friday was again tomorrow the game tonight the games on Sunday who are they playing you know help me out here\nThe national football ... con you she is [laughter] is going to be starting ...\nBy well I think it's I think it's a terrifying thing to imagine I'm the only ... shelter you have is in a parking garage or something yeah 'cause a lot of that's how we are a lot of these meteorologists these reporters will camp out isn't a big but ah but relatively short structure to three story parking garage\nAnd get down into the middle as as a as far into the middle as they can for their safe space but the destruction is\n... I I mean in some of these areas in Panama City in Mexico beach or just unbelievable what I don't understand is\nHow a house like this I mean there's homes on ... so you're a radio point to a picture [laughter] showing you\nBut everything else was on that a lot of house that has on ... every rounded by record everything else on that block is absolutely God so do they go through and say well this house was built in two thousand and one was updated codes the rest were built in the eighties\nYeah he's a perfect laboratory you've got controls and everything you've got houses that were not improve not out of the code you've got ones that were encodes so so uh yeah they go through and do the damage assessment and say look it up we got we got it right 'cause this this came ashore as a cat for correct\nYes but now they're saying because a lot of the wind gauges literally broke when it came on land that they may have to go back and they could potentially bump it up a and retroactively call it a category five figures\nFor for people are not aware like Sandy came ashore as a tropical storm like sixty mile an hour winds still a bar soap but not not a\nA official hurricane and but this isn't that funny how this one that the the one that hit South Carolina we were watching it built for a week and a half right and it was a this was going to be a big one as usual and and uh and ... and ... non qualified radio hosts were swearing this is going to be the worst hurricane ever and then it lost power as it came in and it was a flood event\nThis one was like they got three days there were two days' notice it's on well and the thing\nAbout Michael that was different than Florence was it stayed as strong as it did it was a hurricane on land yeah twelve plus hours when it's highly unusual yeah as a hurricane that's that's the I mean that's a crazy example of how\nAbsolutely powerful it was the other issue and we had another reason why Florida sucks [laughter] because they can't stop the her again the weird crime right [laughter]\nUm ten dull Airforce base is in ruins today\nSingle Airforce bases the home of the F twenty two training they have a full scale aerial target program where they retrofit these F. sixteens uh turn them into drones fly around and then shoot them down\nAnd a lot of the pictures that you may have seen already are hangers with the roost or taken off of them\nAnd inside there are these F. sixteens they they're I guess they referred to as Q. F. sixteens now\nThe the planes that are the more valuable ones all the ... were flown off base days ahead of time and put inland so that they wouldn't be subjected to to to the destruction from hurricane Michael\nThe commanding officer there at the air force base had sent a message is so I think it's about thirty six hundred people who work on the base don't come back until we tell you because it's not safe to be here no water no power no sewer\nAnd then the six hundred or so families I guess or people who live on the base were given approximately an hour and one suitcase to leave\nA gallon of water and Emory via I forgot what it was it was a hurricane in the eighties I think during the Reagan Administration the it hit an air force base in central Florida and they never reopened it it it did so much damage\nThat the air force just wash their hands of it and gave it to Florida to do whatever they would just let the gate or they get back with it yeah and so there I don't think they'll do that with ten do because ten dollars is a really really key training site\nBecause of its access to the Gulf of Mexico which is why they do the live fire training and that's that is the access to the ... just like a at\nA up at a [noise] a port wine aiming\nAt a what's it called the the naval weapons will do what you're pointing to go and they the navy does ... of that stuff there because of its access to the Pacific ocean Pacific missile test for and so they'll keep this one open but the other one they just looked at and they said in a billion bucks to repair it we're not doing it\nUh All right so in in a one o'clock hour trying to get Pete combs again we've talked in the last couple of days he's been in Florida for all of this we actually lost track of him at one point during the during the hurricane so\nUh we'll check in with Pete hopefully in the one o'clock hour first before we get onto this story about this journalist disappearance and or how it's testing our ties with Saudi Arabia how about a thousand dollars\nOn your side one thousand dollars and now the nation like key word luck to two hundred two hundred it'll get affects confirming every

through friday from five AM until about six twenty pm that first hour of the Conway show\nAll right this story of this this journalist that went missing in Turkey is getting weirder by the moment it turns out that\nA guy who used to work for or I guess still technically does unless they find a body ah works for the Washington Post among others and has been sort of an insider who was critical of the royal Saudi Saudi mood that family\nIs gone\nAnd the White House's relationship with Saudi Arabia is a is getting more tense\nThe guy's name is a show gate and he is a guy who showed up at one

message rates may apply right suit sitting in today [noise]\nAh we talked a little bit on\nThis story yesterday or a story a study out of Rand says that are in fact Eighteen thousand randomly selected participants across each of the service branches showed sixty six percent of current service members are considered either\nOverweight or obese and when you look at the uh ... you go farther out and you look at potential recruits are into the military there is a a there's a massive problem and its massive massive apparently\nYeah and you're you're allowed you can be out of the weight standards and in list but it's just that when you get to basic training is true for the marine corps in the army\nYou're diverted before you start real basic training you're diverted for a month into a thing called physical conditioning platoon and they they literally dictate what you're eating and drinking and how much and it's called the PCP platoon or pigs who cannot perform and and so there's there's a correct combination of mental harassment and shaming\nA and all that and is how is how people drop weight and so they can get height weight correct\nOr to get into a basic training and so just and for a lot of recruiters like you see this in Burbank the marine recruiters will take recruits and they'll go on runs\nOr like six months before they're shipped date to down to San Diego and try to get them you know in in ... but obviously it's a reflection of of us in our society and just yesterday we were announced as the fattest country again forty percent Mm obese Mexico was down to thirty three\nUh so uh so we're number one\n[noise] ah they also said that there are so concerned about getting adequate sleep nine percent of military personnel reported taking sleeping medications or their day uh or either daily or almost immediately sleep deprivation and think that was a thing\nYeah you can sleep when you're dead as we say [laughter] um ... you know the deal is that the obesity rate is so huge that they're a it's a new literally a national security concern because there is a national asset and no one ever says this into those Nineteen\nBut the asset of males Eighteen to twenty six is how we defend ourselves against alien invasion or if Belgium invades and so that scene national asset like coastlines or whatever\nAnd if if we don't have an adequate pool of people to draft in case of national emergency if they show up and they need to run around and play with cattle bells and ... for months before they could actually go into basic training as a national security issue to have a fan out already yeah and and yes women too but women don't have to register for the draft\nThere's a reason for that because the national asset the men who told rifles are the reason that we're breathing free air that by the way that is and and women who can told her rifles wants to set women aren't in the draft pool that's an\nOdd conversation to have anybody who's Fifteen sixteen Seventeen years old today as opposed to ah when we had to register for the draft yeah because I think it was a much more fresh in people's minds were trying to do the math twenty seven years ago or whatever it was when I registered\nAnd when Jimmy Carter to after the Russians invaded Afghanistan they reinstitute a draft registration not the rap and I didn't turn Eighteen until like forty eight hours before he started college but I didn't even leave\nFor the Washington state university until I borrowed my dad's car and and I said no dad I'm going to go register and that was a highly Cold War you know what I wanted to eat Russian guts and everything but at age with all her day teen and rubber you had until the\nYeah it was the first day yeah not the end of the year ... Eighteenth birthday\nYeah and I remember telling my son about doing this and how to do it and everything he could do I think you could do it on line now I think he did but to get that card in the mail that just says hey thanks for your really have to go to a place I ... I did to angel and I remember going I remember that was a brand new\nPost office that it opened up a and they were surprised to see me I guess it wasn't a thing that was they didn't get a lot of customers\nBy virtue that both doors open and I said where do I sign up to fight these Tommy bastards and where do I kicked that ayatollah vast while I'm at it and and I was off the navy ROTC anyway I mean it was it was the fate of ... I didn't have to actually registered I was about to go in\nThe service anyway but I still wanted to register for the draft you have I mean it's\nA ... I ... I ... I Wish it was a tradition I may wish more families thought of it as a a a as a rite of passage yeah\nAnd again you know ... me too and the whole thing but women don't have to register for the draft or as you know I and I meant by the way this is not me whining about equality I I Know the reason and I think women no the reason too but uh but women don't have to register for the draft so put that in your pipe and saluted\n[laughter] All right by the way I did find the El Nino songs so that we are selling music a VCR\nSounds like a a scene transition from cocoa though\nI haven't seen the unity cocoa know it looks to it looks like a that other animated thing about David dead\nThough it came out five years before [laughter] well that's one of the cocoa is not not horrible All right we'll come back ... horrible and by not last night when I first met the [laughter] the story of this teacher who wrote about Stephen\nMiller the president's adviser who didn't eat glue and they were a kid\nYou put it on your palm yeah let it dry and then you pull of anger print yes and it had that ... has a slight\nTiny taste remember Gary ... will continue to smoke\n[noise] think about all the ways you can send a thousand dollars [laughter] I don't think too long cans away an avid within twenty minutes okay bass than her radio station [noise]\nBoys in blue getting ready for ...
