{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "And this is my handle here and a good morning on a Monday October Fifteen alright coming up a ... right after I Gary and Shannon come aboard I'm taking phone calls for handle on the law now that we're talking about legal issues\nEight seven Seventy five to zero eleven fifty marginal legal advice off the air for future broadcasting we started the top of the hour so if you're looking for us some advice kind of device I'd love to give and I'm capable of giving called eight Seventy Seventy five to zero\nEleven fifty eight seven Seventy five to zero eleven fifty All right let's go ahead and finish the show with more do they have a case we felt Wainwright Nick and me All right we have a controversy over butter\nIn Wisconsin they're very into butter as you might imagine and if you want to sell your butter in Wisconsin it must be graded under the state's butter grading system double A. you want to want to know a double A. is fine and highly pleasing butter flavor\nWow how's the objective is that one at a grade a pleasing undesirable butter flavored grade beef fairly pleasing butter flavor\nAnd then if you can't make great beat your Wisconsin under grade\nButter ... the crap butter now there are\nEighteen flavor characteristics eight body characteristics for color characteristics into salt characteristics all of which must be graded to get your final score and you basically have to go to school\nTo do this they offer a class at the University of Wisconsin how to do it and then you take a test and much like to get your driver's license there is a written portions and there's actually a practical where you have to grade butter\nIn front of someone like a master ... yes right exactly All right so here's the lawsuit\nDishes in Wisconsin and there's this dairy in Ohio Minerva dairy and they make art is an Amish style butter\nAnd they were selling it in Wisconsin they sell it all over the country and they were selling it in Wisconsin on graded and they got a letter saying hey you can't sell butter in Wisconsin without it being graded so they took their butter off the market and then they sued the state of Wisconsin\nAnd they say these requirements are unfair to out of state butter people\nThat you have all these requirements and it costs too much money to have our butter graded in order to be able to sell it in your state now the state says wait a minute\nAnybody anywhere can can be certified as a butter greater you don't have to be in Wisconsin anybody can do it the license only costs Seventy five dollars for two years\nThe class isn't that expensive where it's not it's not a burden on you if you want to sell your butter here it's pretty easy for you to do does the butter people in Ohio do they have a case\nI Can't imagine that they do because you use the word burdensome\nThere's virtually no burden of coming in and Wisconsin is universal and its application of the law and therefore there's no discrimination\nAnd if anybody is allowed to sell you just have to meet the requirements and the requirements are not purely subjective there's enough there where it's you've got different grades different flavors different colors we're all comes together where there's some rationale other than just some guy\nSaying I like this butterfly versus that butter flavor so\nA Amish no Amish for you yeah they lose what can the Amish\nAre exactly the Irish it and they said the ... the state has a valid interest in having this of course consumer awareness that one on how he butter you're going to get absolutely so they lost All right um one more we can do it yeah\nRemember when whole foods got popped for 'em when you would buy products from them that were sold by weight they were including the weight of the\nPackaging right under that huge trouble they they've gotten huge trouble for selling or any product for under forty five dollars a pound I remember they gotten a lot of trouble for yeah\nAnd so they got sued by consumer groups and they paid a lot of money I change their ways now but there's another lawsuit that happened over the same issue not uh\nTumor lawsuit stock holders said\nThat because they were selling products including the weight of the packaging that meant they were overstating their earnings and it also meant that when they would ever any whole foods executive would ever say in an interview or a press release\nThat we are working on making our prices more market friendly but those were false statements because when they were saying that\nThey were overcharging people over here and they sued whole foods as shareholders for stock fraud\nWow\nAll right ah and ah what is this the lower court decided\nThe lower court so merely ruled in favor of whole foods right of course will go up on appeal I cannot and this is now the appeal right I cannot see how the shareholders could possibly win that one uh because first of all fraud is intent\nOK you have to prove intent second of all ah it's it's it's such a stretch for them to make that argument that it's ... there's the mill rationale is just some warrior convincing some shareholder that we've got a lawsuit here I think ah it's a crock of butter\nThree for three you are to thank you very much alright thank you sir not bad at All right Jerry you're right that coffee was pretty good they're better than the other machine well it was pretty good okay uh\nYeah rely on the other ones were comparing different coffees from different machines because one down the hall is not working and the one next to us is working and it's much better coffee but go ahead and you don't even do commercials for them I don't even do commercials um where do we talking about the aerobics killers and may have

rallies in ah in Montana in July and then\nA Shannon is actually traveling to London next weekend for the chargers game wow and that's\nA great ... she's been in contact allegedly\nWith the queen of England so we're going to see if maybe we can put those two up\nYeah I saw missed the queen of England appearing our show Garry I must tell you\nA it's a you know you know what the secret is that what other than she's a fish me\nYou could call me and say can you do the queen of England on my show and I would say absolutely not okay you know of course\nIt was never end by the way it was never that

[noise]\nHistorical buildings but you can do the whole city really and in a day [noise]\nAnyway so I'm walking in and the program director here at W. T. A. M. nice guy he's introducing me to people and instead of saying like oh hey this is Shannon from cafe in LA she'll be getting hurt her talk show here\nHe's introducing the as this is Shannon she does that she works for the chargers [laughter] cat on April and they're all just looking at me like you know they've got the sports page open on their desk\nOf you know the browns failure yesterday it was a blowout thirty eight to fourteen and it just it was just not the the it was just not the job description title I wanted walking around and meeting a handful of people here they all just kind of looked at me with blank guys [laughter]\nWell come on you're not getting beat up are you know but I'm telling you this story in case that does happen you know why\nI say well do me a favor just tax me the address or where you are so that if I Do have to contact authorities in a\nIn the greater Cleveland area they can provide for ... thank you um we have been ah we've been watching these red flag warnings we knew this was common um this latest wind event and it's really the first true Santa Ana event of the uh or Santana event whatever of ah of the fall\nThis is in northern California they're saying it's a bigger deal as well because this is the first significant wind event they've had since the fires that burned through wine country last year\nYou can tell that they're being preemptive here when the PG and E. companies at the are shutting down power they're trying to prevent anything like what happened and so you can understand them being acting out of the abundance of caution I guess you could say\nYeah and if you go to the so called lettuce and for example the current outages map there's a bunch they're all over the place right now and I don't know how many of them are\nUm are pre planned or the ones that they have said because a bunch of people got calls overnight last night and into this morning from so called lettuce in recorded call that said because of the wind event and because of the potential for there to be a lines that come down there will be areas where we will shut off the power\nAnd I don't know anybody specifically who's had that but there are all kinds of outages that are going on I Would say the majority of them that I've seen it ... just in terms of the uh you know ten thousand foot look at this is all along the ah the foothills all along the two ten freeway from a lot of yadda out to root rancho\nRight most of LA county at risk a angel's national forest and Gabriel Santa Monica mountains Santa Clarita San Gabriel valley is I mean everybody's on this list so it's like all boxes are checked\nThey're saying the mountains are going to get wins between twenty five and forty five miles per hour gusting to sixty five at times Seventy five\nIt's it's weird when you talk about wins here with Santa Anna's and the fire danger when the last time we talked about when we were talking about hurricane category five wins or a cane Michael but are equally as dangerous when it comes to whipping up wildfires in sending those into communities and\nThe one thing they say is if they do in fact shut these down both the genie so Cal at us and even San Diego gas and electric has said this is well\nThey will they will keep them off until they can get eyes on those lines and make sure that they're not going to you know re energized lines that have been a half falling down and then spark a fire after they think everything is better so they're going to keep them off for some time so if your power does go out today it may be a voluntary thing so callous and or some of the other utilities in the area\nMay have in fact turned off the power just 'cause of precaution I'm All right when we come back we're going to get into the story about

and me isn't it mhm uh All right let's talk about Benedictine sorry Benedict Shipley and Francisco ally out to work\nTogether at UC Irvine uh about thirty four year age difference here\nYeah Francisco is a is eighty four Benedict is is fifty\nHe's a professor I'm very beloved professor at UC Irvine world renowned geneticist he had given Irvine more than a eleven million dollars in donations he his name was on buildings that he helped support an assistant dean says he made her feel very uncomfortable\nYeah a Benedict says that ah that Francisco would would hug her a wood kiss or on the cheek\nUm and the thing is he is a Spanish guy again eighty four years old different generation different attitudes different interactions between men and women not an excuse but just an explanation\nHe believed he was showing her admiration with the hugs and the cases on the cheek and telling her that she is beautiful but by the way that is totally what happens in Spain right well as strangers will it will come up to you and and and give you compliments\nIt doesn't even have to be Spain it could be your eighty five year old father you're eighty five year old grandfather who does things like well you're pretty girl well you're you sure look nice or I mean and it's not a it's not a sexual thing it's not a power thing it's just\nHe was raised in time and a place where um complimenting somebody on their looks was a an acceptable thing and people didn't lose their flipping mine's\nTrue true well this fight has completely divided the campus\nOr people who say that this is me too movement gone too far because he has been banned now from campus over this he's been stripped of his titles his name was taken off all of those buildings the university is trying to just erase the fact he was over there\nAnd what I don't understand is there are there are people who went through the exact same thing\nThat just assistant dean went through I mean they were also on the receiving end of his hogs on his a double cheek kissing and they would describe it as adorable um in fact there were there were people who would say that this is not\nA a sexual harassment thing that this is the me too movement gone too far\nOne of the things that is interesting is whether or not the UC system and the rules they follow it or ... the the rules that define what is sexual harassment it's clearly each\nObject well yes uh yes those could change because they what the what the Trump Administration wants to do is use a definition for title nine\nThat's used by the Supreme Court that says that the interaction has to be objectively offensive so something that offends this woman but when you when I take a look at it we're like no\nNot so offensive then then it's not a violation of title nine but the problem with that is that it is uniquely\nA personal what one person\nThinks is offensive and what another person thinks is offensive women do not agree on this obviously um there was a Brown University professor at the LA Times interviewed a rose McDermott she specializes in these issues\nAnd she says that younger women are more sensitive to to to this perceived harassment than older ones maybe because they didn't grow up because they're growing up as me to era and they didn't grow up with the eighty five year old grandpa or whatever that is going to compliment yet on how you can give you a kiss on your cheek\nAnd she said how we draw the line between inappropriate or patronizing behavior and genuine harassment is challenging because women themselves don't agree and those in between spaces are getting harder to go to to negotiate\nAnd it's true what what may be offensive to one person is a funny in a joke or maybe even flattering to the next person well\nHere's a I have a hard time and I know it's weird coming from the guy side of this I mean I have a hard time with\nSomebody who would look at eighty four year old French ... and say something like this guy is so dirty and demeaning that I Can't do my job because that's the other part of it I mean it's got to be something sufficiently a severe or pervasive and I'm reading from the title nine wrote rules here\nIt has to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to unreasonably interfere with the person's education or their employment in this case their employment\nCounty today is the last day to file\nTaxes if you filed
