idea the rams were starting started in Cleveland it was just little nuggets of history all day long you know the the Jersey that Joe Montana Warren Superbowl sixteen when he earned the MVP again and I forgot that he rushed for fifty nine yards in that game\nIt was just like back to back to back to back\nAmazing little fact well there's there's one room in there\nWhere they have like um you you go in and and it's like a lock around right and there's different styles and its Joe Montana next to red grains next to how we long and just like ten or twelve just great and and what their locker would look like\nAnd you sit down on benches are sitting down in a locker room and then a hologram of Joe name is ...\nAnd he's telling you the story of all of these players who came from nothing who were counted out we were told that they weren't good enough how they are now hall of famers like Steve Largent right never big enough to be taken seriously and now he's in the hall of fame and then and then they have holograms of\nGeorge ... and Vince Lombardi and the locker room speeches that they would give and it was just magical\nNow obviously it sounds like you were in love with this but how did the players' response to all of this stuff I mean we're ... we're they appreciating it as much because they're living this type of thing as opposed to you and I who would be fans of this type of thing\nThis is how real this this this season has got for the chargers there was one player who went and he's a rocky and he doesn't play\nI think that they didn't want to jinx anything oh there are tons of Super Bowl\nTons of Super Bowl memories here and they are on a killer season right now at foreign to losing only to the best teams in football with the rams and the chief so I think this team is locked in and they do not want to think about the hall of fame and think about what could be ah\nThey still do they they stayed away like like uh yeah they ... they stayed away there was no chance they're going to go um\n[noise] but I Will tell you this there's one little interactive theater there it's called the road to the super bowl so I'm like oh that sounds cool\nAnd you you go in and it's this round theater and I was the only one because there are so few so few of us in your ear kind of by yourself which was really cool\nAnd so I go into the theater and they shut their doors and they your she's like okay you're going to be in there for twenty two minutes like okay twenty two minutes and you can't really get out right you're stuck in there because it's a it's a theater that moves around it rotates and the doors move and it's kind of like the haunted house you know\nSo I'm In there and I'm thinking it's going to be all about teams get to the super bowl no\nNo it's about last

sexually assaulting two women but evidence collected in the case\nShows that this was there I Know they did this with dozens of women they they go out to clubs they be friend a woman that the girlfriend usually with the friend a woman ... this couple by the way young very good looking you would not think that they were into this\nI mean I Know it doesn't discriminate when it comes to bad behavior in terms of good looking people but you could see where women would be lulled into a false sense of security at these\nTwo I Would imagine that sort of a natural response that ah that goes

said last month they received about fifty phone calls and that generated more than twelve credible leads to potential additional victims in the case but if you remember when we first covered this

[noise]\nThirteen sitting last night after ... Hernandez called out the fans for having no energy in that last game they were louder than I've ever it'll Dodger Stadium was larger than I've ever heard it coming through at least ... coming through the television and from the beginning it\nWas loud ... which is with a problem with Dodger Stadium is nobody shows up until the fourth inning and then he was\nProud it made me proud to be a dodger's fan last night because you know what they they took what he said to heart and they wanted to show their team that they were behind them and the players that absolutely it felt different we felt like the fans were with us and were they were behind his every step of the way and you know what most of the stadium stayed into the thirteenth ... belly hit that\nAnd that's good I mean granted it was just starting a time of six thirty nine I think of whatever it was the first pitch six oh nine\nSo we're talking about a five hour again yeah that's a lot of baseball it is just ... you know they cut off beer sales in the eight or ... and people will start running out of food started get hungry eating some of the lesser fans but uh that that'd be a side\nYesterday this time we're talking about many Machado and how he plays um it he's been a good point\nThey are for the Dodgers since he came over a at the at the trade deadline but\nIt was hot when he first came here on earth cooled off and everyone's like guys not worth it and then last night this total classless move out I think he admitted it and post game ... the classless\n... portions of his game started before that and we're talking yesterday Blake and I were saying\nThat his slides into second base on Monday Night were ridiculous I mean and I don't know if he's got something uh uh against our CEO the shortstop for the brewers or if you just playing\nYou know playing tough and taking his lied to a a new thing but even regardless of the chase subtly rule regardless of the new rules around second base and trying to protect us middling feel there's\nHe went out of his way to you know stick his hand up and the guys crotch he went out of his way and the second slide to grab the guys like yes it was after the throw was made but still those are just cheesy bad attitude plays\nAnd he admitted it when pressed uh what what happened there at first last night at or tonight and he said I'll do anything to help my team when and if that's dirty then I guess I'm dirty\nBut but you don't want that reputation here's the thing a ... he's been a good rental for the Dodgers especially since Corey Seeger was out\nBut he's not coming back no they they the Dodgers won't stand for that I mean the Dodgers celebrate players oh they'd have to spend money on him to the yes the action as even there but but I mean listen ... has been a problem not because he's he's got a horrible attitude where he plays the game wrong it's because he plays with almost too much enthusiasm now he and he got\nA motion and nobody should be faulted for emotion but when you when you purposefully try to injure another player and I mean it's apples and oranges right there yeah\nAnd the idea that um for some reason he was a I don't know upset that the brewers took offense to it I mean come on it was a ridiculous it was ridiculous move on his part for those who didn't see it\nHe was thrown out at first base a and the play was made in front of him so he knows he's already out but he makes a point of dragging his left foot and basically kicking the first baseman\nSo it was just a silly but here's Dave Roberts on it after the\nGame I think a ... foot on first base and didn't give a Matty a whole lot of room on the back I didn't see the replay so he stepped on his food and I think that's with a man he was talking about but\nWe all worked it out and we all worked out a supposedly they hugged in the thirteenth ending I didn't I didn't see that but [noise] um the thing is Manny Machado and that attitude do not play in Los Angeles they ... it does not go I mean you can't you can't celebrate guys\nLike Che subtly like Justin Turner like ... like ... or you can't celebrate guys like that\nAnd then turn around and pay somebody like many Machado three hundred million dollars\nIf the Dodgers lose this game this could be the last time you see Clinton cursed saw on the mound for the home team a Dodger Stadium he\nCan opt out of the remaining two years of his contract and he was asked about that yesterday about processing this moment before this next start differently because of the opt out and he says he's trying not to think about that he says I think it's hard enough to try and win a postseason game I Know more than anybody knows that he said\nThat's interesting and that's hard to believe Clayton crush on not
