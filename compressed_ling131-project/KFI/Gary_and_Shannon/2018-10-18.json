you noticed that robo calls are on the rise that they're on the rise by like fifty percent or something this is what's amazing is that I don't\nUsually get a lot of bad calls or robo calls on my cell phone but I'm Still one of those dinosaurs that has a landline more because my parents are only call me on my land line they don't know what cell phones are are than anything else\nAnd all of the numbers that we have filed with the school for example for my daughter is the you know the emergency number that's our land line up that we can change it but that's why we still have it that's where we are getting all of our calls\nNow there are a couple of different reasons that you're seeing an up tick now obviously politics I mean if you haven't received one of the\nWere doing some research and we love it if you have to answer a few questions for us you admitted to actually doing that and well one of those calls in answering their questions and I found that to be a surprising\nI'll do the live once I I Will do the recorded ones or I'll do a recorded one half way through and hang up knowing that an absolutely blows whatever you know chance they had it using my information but I'll do the live one because I Want to hear the questions they're asking\nWhen it comes to these polls um book so politics clearly the midterms coming up the second one is we've seen so many apps that you can put on your phone now your your your cell phone your smartphone\nThat block calls that\nThese robocall companies have to shock on even more calls out there so that's one of the reasons the other one is it's easier to do that it's easier to do a robocall you for example could go on to a website\nType in a bunch of numbers upload your audio whatever you want it to be and then have it call for you very cheap and high you know high volume phone calls that there is the other partner\nThere have been scams or not just politics surveys things like that cold calls\nThere were a number of calls at targeted Chinese communities this spring I'm more than thirty consumers in New York City were scammed to the tune of three million dollars by callers pretending to be from the Chinese consulate demanding money to settle a criminal matter [laughter]\nI haven't heard and I haven't gotten one yet but I've heard a couple of people say recently but they are receiving\nUm robo calls like this in Chinese oh I'd love to get one of those calls yeah but why does that I can say ... how did what was that\nMeans I'm not sure but it's all I Know how to say in Chinese gets like thank you or You're welcome or allow\nMe how it's like a low ... maybe because of that nature um in April\nThey were trying to the the Senate was trying to address the issue of robo calling a guy named Adrian Abramoff itch testified before the committee on Congress nicer transportation\nThe FCC find this guy a hundred and twenty million dollars replacing a hundred million robocalls over a three month period he said in his testimony told the committee\nThat he found robo calling software and services just by searching Google that's all and that a lot of these services provide a neighbor spoofing function which I notice all the time\nEspecially on these calls when it comes to boost up political a research firms it will be a call from my area yes\nYes me too and it it's almost sometimes off just two digits from my phone number I only\nOh yeah wow yeah I'm ...\nIt's crazy though you and I we don't have to answer these calls you know we don't have real jobs there are people that have real jobs in this world you know real estate agents are people that are in sales that ...\nTo put something on after you're done yes well I ... and where something in the car on your way there and it had to wear your underwear and it\nIs going to be with me as well so he may I I could wider drive for you after you going to be okay I don't well now you have to figure that out I don't know there's a lot of unknowns

[noise]\nAlso ah the earlier today we found out that a San Bernardino county sheriff's deputy was wounded when he was shot in an apartment complex in Adelanto a Andrew mall and back or solve this news conference just a short time ago from San Bernardino county sheriff's department Andrew what's going on\nThis is a deputy who who's been with the department for five years he has four kids who are in their teens the whole family is now here at the hospital at arrowhead regional medical center what the sheriff's department is saying right now is that this whole event started with a traffic stop this morning at Adelanto\nAnd then to deputies either hurt themselves or they got a call about sounds of shots nearby\nThat this was at an apartment complex so they walk up to the apartment complex to figure out what's going on and investigators say at least one person from inside the apartment shot at the deputies and San Bernardino county sheriff Jim McMahon says one round hit deputy Robert John\nAccording to the doctors around went through the abdomen and struck several organs and they treated and fix those the best of their ability it remains in critical condition and they will continue to monitor his progress\nAfter the shooting a the deputies who showed up are able to get the deputy who was shot out of there he was taken by helicopter to the hospital and then those who responded afterward went into the apartment and arrested two people at again this is the sheriff McMahon saying that the two people are actually from LA\nAs you may be aware of this is the third of event in the last ... days where our deputy sheriff were fired upon by suspects in this county God that's incredible\nRight now he is in critical but stable condition really it sounds like the complicating factors\nWere not only did the round strike his abdomen but some organs are there as well but I can at least say that his family is here and they are optimistic that he's going to survive\nTo know anything about the guys in custody\nNot so far uh that's what we'd like to know uh I asked at the news conference any idea what these two guys from LA are doing it in an apartment complex a late at night it was like early this morning about one o'clock this morning and they said they haven't figured that out yet\nBut uh a couple of guys from LA they're saying and so will want to find out a lot more about their background and and really one of the other questions was if the sheriff's department believes that this was an ambush that they ... they were specifically trying to lure deputies to the apartment where they work so far investigators say they have no idea if that's the case\nOf and also what was the original shooting about because again this started his deputies are on what we believe to be a totally unrelated call they're just on a traffic stop\nAnd then they find out that their sons of shots really close\nWhat we know so far is that nobody else was actually hit so what was being shot at that initially led the deputies to this apartment complex that we don't know\nYou could have just been somebody\nShooting at nothing at first I'm right which is the is the apartment complex was it described it all as a hotbed of activity like this and they responded to this place before or is it unusual for them to be out in that area\nThey didn't mention any previous calls at this particular place and again we don't know if the people who were actually in the apartment lived there or if they were just visiting or what the the nature of there being there was a what we did hear is that the devotees we're still kind of outside the complex when the one was hit\nA weather was walking on the street or the sidewalk so it wasn't actually in any kind of\nGated apartment complex who just outside\nOf and and don't even know for sure whether the shooter knew who was walking up what we also did find out is that the deputy who was shot and is now in critical condition he had a best on those Kevlar vest but apparently the round went just below the edge of it\nAnd that's when it hit his stomach and those are some vital organs there as well\nAnd then any idea what kind of weapon was it a rifle was you\nKnow it was a hand gun was a hand gun but so far they're not saying what kind of you know how that goes but they said it was a handgun\nAll right Andrew thanks you got it\n... back there the latest and again this was a San Bernardino county sheriff's deputy hit this morning\nUm when when they were responding what they believe was just um they either heard shots of responding to a call the shots fired Robert John forty five years old shot today but he is in critical but stable condition after undergoing surgery and\nJust based on what they said you know if this was a bullet through his abdomen and hit a couple of Oregon's it's probably not going to be as last surgery that he's going to see\n[noise] yeah and you know you're going to have probably ... I mean probably a good chance you're going to find out that the shooter\nThe background was probably has a background probably has done time recently and in California we just let people out um if you're going to open fire on a on an officer that's [laughter] it's pretty damn brazen\nIn Milwaukee and you can hear the action on him five Seventy LA sports write a story that we talked about yesterday because we knew they were going to be in court\nDr grant robust show and his girlfriend's arrested Riley accused of rape by drugs kidnapping world population by anesthesia solve with intent to commit sex offenses and some other crimes judge\nHas set bail it one million dollars for the defendants in light of these new charges\nUm we found out that some of the charges that were added yesterday apparently came before Dr robust show hooked up with ... and that's why they're not sharing these are these in a they're not sharing the counts\nThe surgeon is accused of three felony counts of kidnapping now with intent to commit a sexual offense four counts of rape by using drugs to couch assault intent to commit a sexual offense forcible rape world population by Anastasia\nOr counts possession of a controlled substance for sale to counts possession of an assault weapon I mean all of this when you add it altogether disguised potentially looking at eighty plus years in jail he's found guilty and all of this stuff\nOne of the big stories coming out of these arrests has has been timing what what's the timing the first sexual assault allegations surfaced in April of twenty sixteen and it was the end of twenty Seventeen before they got a search warrant I Believe they did a search in January and then it took months for an arrest\nAnd Tony ... Koch is kind of broke his silence about that and gave us some more details saying that some of the defendants computers and devices they had to tread lightly because they didn't want to\nUm violate doctor patient or attorney client privilege with these so they had to have a clean team go in and go through this stuff and obviously that's going to take more time till we threw it\nWhen they did do that um that search warrant finally when they served it in January of this year they found the video or they said they found a video of at least one of the women being assaulted one of the woman who's involved in these charges\nMay also discovered several videos and photographs of other potential victims on the phones the couples phones some of which were taken at festivals that included burning man splash house in Palm Springs they also turned up large quantities would be illegal drugs that's why this guy's been a also accused of controlled substance Brazil\nFor other firearms unregistered assault rifles and several large capacity magazines so if nothing else\nIf nothing else I mean the the statement that the ... put out was that they are not guilty of any of this they unequivocally tonight all allegations of non consensual sex and absolutely deny any allegations that they secretly drug getting one for the purposes of having sex with them\nThey didn't say anything about the assault weapons and uh and you know um [noise] drugs that they had in this guy's apartment\nBut you're right I mean we that was our question is how does it take\nThe January search warrant why does it take eight months basically before it's turned over to the da's office who then in one week or roughly comes out with a charges and an arrest warrant for this guy\nYeah and and that was that Todd Spitzer and who is who is running against for ... and November ... those two are have been fighting for years\nAnd that's what he was saying speculating that a tiny ... sitting on this because he wanted it to come out closer to the election and here's the thing that I don't really understand about that reasoning\nHow does Tony ... as da ... bump for to bad people\nThat are going around drugging and raping women like how does that give him a boost because there's two more bad people in orange county that they've managed it's not like it's not like Tony ... with a cowboy hair and went out and and and found these people and you know what I mean it's\nYeah I I understand but I but I Do think there is something to be said about well look at me I'm busy a prosecuting the bad people and keeping you know this this place a safer\nAnd everybody knows it's the detectives and the cops and the prosecutors who were actually trying cases that that do the work I I don't know I just I don't understand I don't follow that reasoning of of of er Cox is getting some sort of bumps with with the news conference about these two bad apples\nYou mentioned Todd Spencer I'm currently the Orange County supervisor running for a running for ... for Koch as\nHe has like you said been critical of the prosecutors for not getting on this months ago well he handed to some of the reporters\nCopies of the search warrant from January and that was a ... a search warrant well of course well listen it there were some media outlets that got it after the charges were filed but then was sealed by the court so yesterday the judge\nHad all of the reporters who were in the courtroom turned over the court the copies of the search warrants the tides pits are handed them\nAnd then ordered that they not publish any of the details that were in that war and\nBecause they were saying that the ... the the the search warrants themselves not that they would have given away necessarily information about the doctor and the girl friend but that they could to potentially contained extremely sensitive information about the rape victims and um that is not something that they want to get out\nThere is it Orange County district attorney's office repeatedly embarrassed itself I don't know is that it's Todd's or they're going after them it's it's a jailhouse informant program ah being run afoul ... come on get it together it's embarrassing\nUh hey if you are a hockey fan hockey fan now you can hear every LA kings hockey game live on the free I hurt radiolab you download the app keyword LA kings and

umpires original call which was fan interference and\nThe batter is out not a ground rule double the batteries out because the assumption is that the outfield or would have made the play\nSome people are saying that this is proof that a big fat guy like Joe ... that's the umpires name should not be umpiring in the outfield\nDuring these playoff games because he's not fast enough to get out there and oh by the way he made exactly the right call and the dumbest part about the entire thing is he just let it be alive ball right so for the guy what did you see one of the closest from the guy who hit movie best in his glove right\nTo say that that evidence that Joe ... shouldn't be making the calls it doesn't make any sense you're west never ended up making the call they said just the replay

trying to game plan how it is we're going to go about doing this I'm\nGoing to keep you updated on social media so if you want to follow the progress of the flights flights a at Gary and Shannon is how we are going to post all of this stuff tomorrow Twitter Facebook or Instagram et cetera big stories that we've been following today locally the San Bernardino county sheriff's deputy that was shot\nEarly this morning shop by someone in an apartment building in Adelanto had to undergo surgery was hit in the abdomen or some organ damage so there was also a fire in an underground natural gas storage area up in the bay area today which is a strange story because\nChevron had to shut down a natural gas pipeline and then they said they were going to inject it with nitrogen to put the fire out\nBut they had to evacuate several thousand people are out of the way because of the potential for explosion alright I'm speaking of explosion the president egg had made some comments at a cabinet meeting yesterday that's a infuriated a few people or he was talking about fire management strategy here in California\nAnd the the problem that the president gets into when it comes to this issue is\nHe needs to have somebody on the ground in the state of California telling him what's going on in the state of California he said at this meeting I say to the governor or whoever's going to be the governor of California you better get your act together\nWere ... not just we're just not going to continue to pay the kind of money we're paying because of fires that should never be to the extent now outside of the weird context of what he's saying there were suggestions that the forest management that we're doing the firefighting that we're doing is not working\nA couple of months ago you remember you said that our environmental laws were preventing firefighters from accessing water also not a thing that the\nIt's that's not true but the issue of old trees\nSitting rotting drying on the floor of a forest and that the state is not cleaning them up and doesn't touch them I have a bigger issue with the way we've been fighting fires because there are some fires that should be allowed to burn and burn themselves out as long as\nThey're not in the way of uh you know coming rolling down the hills into someone's neighborhood that's where we need to draw lines because fires have very natural process of a forest life so the idea that there would be dry rotting dead trees on the forest floor\nIs supposed to be burned they are supposed to burn now the other issue is this is not a state issue all the time because about half of all of our fire acres I mean you look at a a million and a half acres last year almost a million and a half\nAbout half of that was on federal land this year one point three six six million acres have burned about half of that has been on federal\nLand I mean we're not done yet but this one of those things that the president doesn't have to get a he doesn't have to get involved with because the unfortunate thing is he doesn't have somebody on the ground here telling him what's going on so it makes them some weird comments that just don't pertain to anything when it comes to fighting fires in California\nOh and then there's the way they can just sit back relax and enjoy my tweets\nIn the context of this caravan of Honduran immigrants sorry migrants coming through a trying to come through Mexico is tweet from this morning I'm watching the Democratic party lead as sorry led assault sorry\nI'm trying to read this I'm watching the Democrat

including them in many criminals from entering the United states in addition to stopping all payments to these countries which seemed to have the ... almost no control of their population I must in the strongest of terms ask Mexico to stop this onslaught guess what Mexico got this message\nMexican Government dispatched a couple of Boeing seven twenty sevens full of federal Ali's to the southern border to top a true love Chiapas on the border with Guatemala the four thousand strong migrant group that's been marching from Honduras\nEventually they say to get to the United states has been stopped there\nThey have been in something of a stand off a with different immigration officials in different countries those they make their way through now they're going to get to the Mexican border and Mexico is going to say to them\nPapers place you must have a passport or a visa to get into Mexico and a reason to be there and if you don't have\nThose yes you can apply for refugee status but that's going to take your three months probably to get through there\nThey they've been telling these migrants Mexican officials even though they're not actually at the border with Mexico they've been telling them listen there is no transit visa that allows you to cross through Mexico and go all the way to the to the northern border with the United states the president has said if necessary\nHe would dispatch the U.S military to the border and stop\nStop cross border traffic I don't know if he's talking about business traffic freight traffic but ... traffic exactly what he means but he is saying in a he's very serious about doing this it sounds like to try to prevent these people from coming into the United states aren't coming back\nAlex Stone and I have many things in common and one of them after tomorrow will be that we've both flown in an F. sixteen with the air force thunderbirds we'll talk to Alex about his experience heck of a ride heck of a rat or coming up next on the Gary
