got uh just the right amount of thread on them to get all the way through the hard would end the plywood Dan down into the floor Joyce but in addition to that\nThey have a special little score line right around the bottom of the chef the top of the threads and that score line does something magical when we put it in and I'm going to do it now and we're uh we're demo ing this on Instagram alive right now\nSo here we go ready to put it into depth cage and down it goes [noise]\n\nYou're that snap oh yeah okay the score line wants to screw hit just enough torque on it the score line cause the whole shaft of the screw\nTo snap off leaving nothing but the thread part behind and now the screw is perfectly\nOne fifth of an inch below the surface of the hard way so uh what you see is just this little tiny pinhole you see a tiny hole which you convince a filled with a with a puppy or any you know whatever would filler is available to match your hardwood floor\nSo for the cost of one tiny little hole\nWhich in the end is going to be a noticeable and your hardwood floor you have resolved the squeak forever yeah there are a squeaky problem squeaky doors freaking doors if you've got old critiquing doors adjust nine times out of ten means that the the hinge pins needs some more grease on them\nGetting hinge pins out is a is a comedy of errors when it comes to most the wires I see people take pliers to them I see people take chisels and try and get under the top had\nA and even when someone knows how to do it right which is with a hammer and a nail set if you're not really experience with the hammer you could uh put a dent in your door casing your door jam or scratch your door so there are these little items now which are great these are little\nSteel nail sets with the springs on them\nAnd uh they cost about eleven bucks and this is the hinge pin a version and you can see this guy right here I got a hinge mounted on the side of this door sample I'm just going to put him up underneath and all you do is pull down on the bottom stretch out the spring let it go oh\nJust flew right off and there it is they hinged fan sprouts and clear oh you're not kidding it fly you get out of the way because it looks like it's a explosive devices sending out shrapnel so now squeak no more kittens are about twenty bucks ... squeak are constantly a problem and now\nI have found that simply taking some WD forty\nAnd spraying the hinge it works its way into the hinge and does a pretty good job you can\nFor sure it can't or some some hinges are are\nAre a little older than others and need more than that are typically we put white grease on them or even Vaseline or on a ... the problem with WB forty is the now there are I should step this back and clarify because there are two formulas a WD forty there is a WD forty lubricant out there right now\nWhat you just mentioned using that stuff good to go standard WD forty lubricate temporarily but it's mostly a solvent and eventually it will flash off again so what seems like is working at the moment got it will eventually evaporated and kind of a you know and leave you wanting\nGuinea and not know that and of course if you're squeaking because the door is a high ... uh what's the word I'm looking for the door jammed his off and it doesn't quite fit anymore uh\nAll the carpenter you have to do you shave that should\nBe ... you will you know it probably nine times out of ten to ... need shaving\nProbably the top hinge on the door\nHas started to sag a little bit\nThe jam itself and if you were removed that top hinge and in the little but area where it has been routed out for that hinge on the gym if you get yourself a nice long would screw\nGo all the way through the gym all the way into the woods behind it and then replace the hinge it will probably suck that jam up about an eighth of a quarter of an inch and resolve\nWow bagging sticking door to door sticking that's we're going to go I it's
