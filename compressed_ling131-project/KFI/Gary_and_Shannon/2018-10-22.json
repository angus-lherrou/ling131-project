Believe his role is to hold the wipes yeah yeah it was\nA it was just to make sure that I was hydrated and wiped\n'em [laughter] we get to uh\nWe get to the base so he was there with me all day friday and got to see from from the sort of right hand perspective what I had to go through the training et cetera to get into the F. sixteen and fly with a fund a bird number eight\nWell I'm One of the things that Nick got to witness was the objection protocol checklist that I have to go through and the safety safety talk that if I ever find myself under canopy you know under the parachute yeah\nWhich at that point everything has gone wrong here's what I Need to do for my checklist before I touched down on the earth and you could think of was goose will know all I could think of was\nIf this happens like if I if I Do have to leave the aircraft quickly yeah and in the air [laughter] then I'm going to have an even better story I mean that the\nWay that we both were thinking like worst case scenario would be best for the show right\nExactly I mean granted I Would be doing the show without legs or or you know from some hospital in the antelope valley but it would be a great story but even\nEven through all of that um I I wasn't concerned about the objection thing and I figured if I you know I'm not even sure why paying attention because if that happens I'm clearly not going to remember a word that this guy is saying but I Need to at least\nGive him the impression that I'm taking this very seriously so the flight successful ... know pass out no ... no ... everything was clean and dry when we got back now white snow wipes or my T shirt was soaked through 'cause I was sweating but other than that everything was clean and dry a and then\nThis morning I Walk in and Nick

Adams and he had been casually dating her now before he was dating ... he had a baby\nWith his girlfriend from Boulder has ball or as as girlfriend from Sacramento when he was at Boulder and\nShe said she at the time was suing him for child support because he wasn't paying up and then\nDecided that he would pay half of what the judge ordered and so that was their arrangement half of what was ordered and then be a better father which never panned out but anyway so they break up he's paying or half of what he always there and he gets eureka pregnant\nGoes to a goes to watch a movie with her they take separate cars something like that and again she's pregnant at the time he had paid somebody to kill ... um van Brett Watkins and Michael Kennedy pull up beside shriek his car and open fire\nMet magically she is able somehow to call nine one one now remember this was Nineteen Ninety nine\nSo\nWe didn't have cell phones really I mean only a few people had cell phones is only a few people had car found it wasn't like a thing um but she was able to call nine one one and told the dispatcher she's sitting there eight months pregnant bleeding out from these bullets\nShe is able to tell the dispatcher that rake rooted stopped his car in front of hers and then that's when the other vehicle pulled up in the passenger shot at her\nThey had to deliver the baby\nOf via C section and chancellor Lee Adams the baby was um was born with brain damage cerebral palsy because of lack of oxygen caused by the shooting\nAnd at ... Eighteen years old now and he's being raised by ... mother there was a time in prison were rake roof heads had written something like that he wanted he should be the one who should be raising his son\nThat that that and that his mother should be raising her son which is ironic since you pay somebody to kill or yeah or ms Adams should not be doing this I Want that responsibility back ms Adams being a ... mother um chancellors grandmother so you'd probably\nRealized how much care the kid needs ... said hell\nNo yeah he came back in March sent a letter from prison saying he'll no longer pursue a relationship with the sun once he is released and he says for all involved in this ordeal pleased calm down I Will no longer be pursuing a relationship with chancellor I promise to leave them be which I now see used in every one's best interest\nI remember when he was found he was found holed up in a car with like\nBottles of his own urine yeah because he was missing for like a month after the murder and they had like candy bars and bottles of year and just like one of those weird\nSituations where you're living in a ... that we are now grandma by the way who's raised this kid has previously said that she would forgive right growth and would even allow him to have a relationship with his son she said\nBack in February I've forgiven re already\nI don't know and\nThat is a but as a powerful muscle I don't think I have\nNo I don't have that either this\nThey say that forgiveness is a gift to give yourself\nYou know because if you're if you're harboring any on about every yeah exactly it's no good for you it's no good for your health it's not a gift you give them but it gives you give yourself\nAnd I think it requires a lot of a lot of face\nYeah uh and that makes me question how deep\nAnybody's face is if you I don't know that that to me is a ... that's not ridiculously is not the right word that's a it's hard it's an amazing thing to wrap my head around that somebody could forgive somebody else for killing you're pregnant daughter but that would even be a possibility\nAnd then robbing your grandbaby of a normal life right\nAnyway rake Rufus out or got out of\nJail he's forty four years old yesterday told a TV station\nExcited about just being out of here I'm nervous just about how I'll be received by the public he says I still have to work I still have to live I have to exist out there and it just seems like there was so much hate and negativity toward me\nWell I got to say I didn't forget rake Ruth and what he did and it's been Twenty years I mean he was a bad dude I I don't remember all the details of trial but there were other girlfriends that came forward and said uh he threatened to murder means unless I had an abortion and all of the stories of just\nWhat a bad dude he was um his son\nChancellor Eighteen now with the with the brain damage in the sea pie he and a grandmother\nThat's taken care of and moved into a new house just last year paid for by an organization to help alumnus ... alumni alumnae of University of Colorado where he played is football play college football like you said\nUh they raised a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to fund a new home that allows grandma to care for chancellor well into his adulthood um there are no stairs there is a purpose built bedroom in a bathroom specifically for chancellor

Ninety One year old wife was found nearby missing from Palmdale since the sixteenth of October\nSaving all day and age that's incredible that she would still be alive I mean I don't know what condition she isn't but it's unfortunate and he said the family says that this couple does not get out often\nYeah the take very short trips so it's a I mean just based on the age uh it sounds like somebody got disoriented maybe somebody took a wrong turn they couldn't find their way back home so um any where the the wife is in the hospital Ninety One years old a also a big deal around here of course is that a game one of the world series is tomorrow night Dodgers Red Sox for five o nine\nFirst pitch in fact every day at least on the schedule now every game starts at five o nine so just to keep that in your calculator I think Sundays scheduled for five Fifteen but they ... for some reason to keep doing these league championship series games were there were seven games between the Dodgers in brewers and there were six different starting times\nSeven that bothers you I don't know why that's the thing if you lose your trying to develop an audience like just make it just made worlds that area and we're going to happen on an aries yes but the\nPay and about an hour we're going to be asking for your stories ... confessional is we're bringing it back because did you hear about the harrowing experience of a woman up in Sacramento with her driver\nOverdrive or lost ... lost her marbles and the\nWorst one of the more of my worst nightmares [laughter] All right so we'll do that but hey it's twelve thirty which means we dive into Washington\nWant to know I Am going [laughter]\n[noise]\nMe uh I think that one of the big conversations around Washington DC is what's going on with this caravan of people that is making its way from Central America up through Mexico\nI guess eventually to make its way to the United states um ... let's be clear if this was happening to any other country they would they would marsh will be a military and put them on the border and not allow people to come up yes we're days away from that several days away from that\nBut let's be clear that is what any other country would be doing the president\nSays that's what the u._s. should be doing that this caravan must be stopped he spoke at the White House today said that the caravan is actually much bigger than it has been reported to the Latin American migrants making its way through Mexico he's been blaming Democrats for current surge of migrants into the U.S saying that the you know it's our\nOur lenient immigration laws and he's also threatened to cut off our aid to countries\nLike Honduras El Salvador and Guatemala\nYeah and that's not a little threat I mean we in fiscal year twenty Seventeen I think we provided those countries combined with more than a half a billion dollars\nHe is talking about MS Thirteen gang members being on this caravan a questionable middle Easterners he's just throwing things at the wall here I mean he could be right but there's no evidence to support any of that yeah 'cause\nI don't know of anybody has any great idea of what's going on in terms of who they are so now yeah [laughter] um but it is he is right I mean there are thousands of people there ah from what we saw five thousand we saw a number of this morning of seven thousand plus and I don't know if you saw what Associated Press said\nThe Associated Press a road was it yesterday that this was a\nRag tag army of a pool of a poor they called the migrant caravan a rag tag army of the poor now a pie only has about Thirteen million followers on a on Twitter so\nThey came out and apologized after they got called out for it saying the wording was poorly chosen and has been removed from our coverage of the Caribbean\nCare or they were trying to paint a word picture\nRag tag army of the poor Jimmy does not sound like a ridiculously a tone deaf thing I mean now I don't know if you'd want to wallow in that and make a sort of the style baby uses going forward but I can understand somebody looking at the group of people and saying yeah I mean I don't\nThink you need to apologize for that it is what it is a here's\nThe thing when solar that O'Brian calls you out you have to apologize no you don't CNN's soul without O'Brian wrote hey a fee it's not an army really inappropriate to call it as such and then she writes do better\nOkay because they're insinuating it's an army that is going to be a threat to our country is that what I'm getting\nI don't know the national Hispanic association of Hispanic journalists also criticized VA piece of the terms like rag tag and poor\nMust be exchanged for words that are less biased in some\nOkay one of the definitions of army is an organized military force equipped for fighting on land ... got it okay another definition of army is a large number of people are things yeah\nTypically formed organized for a particular purpose like an army of photographers if an army a photographer's descended on this army of rag tag poor would she take issue with them calling it an army a photographer's like those that are ... are going to go to battle\nAs lord ... wearing apologizing for everything and rag tag among apologized for anything else ever we have an apologist for anything ever that's true um\nAnyway as if it was funny that the a P got called out for this um the issue of what's going to happen to them I think is still left up in the air obviously the president is calling us an emergency situation which I think is probably the funniest thing I saw all day I'm Sorry he used emergency\nEmergency I got on Twitter\nI'm Bernie Sanders [noise]\nThe uh did an interview with the hill dot TV and he says there is reason to doubt the blue wave\nIn the midterms saying the control of Congress is going to be decided by just a few tight races he told a crystal ball that's her name I Know a lot of people talking about this blue wave and all that stuff but I don't believe it\nAnd he said that the outcome from November six is going to be very very close and he predicts that only a handful of votes will determine whether Democrats were able to regain control of the house or Senate\nWe either have to be able to stand up to the Trump or we don't\nWell it looks like the latest out of its Campbell about this murdered Saudi Arabian journalist is that there is footage of people burning documents\nOutside the consulate following the murder and the president by the way says he is not satisfied with the explanations he's heard about the death of this journalist Jim ... he of course was a critic of the Saudi royal family he was living in Virginia here\nAnd died October second at that consulate in Istanbul they say that and he was stripped because they use is closed or to put on a body double that ... the consulate ah he was stripped he could they cut his fingers off they beheaded him\nIt just looks like a really unpleasant afternoon he had gone there for a certificate that he needed for his upcoming marriage\nBy the way what documents would they possibly have that they needed to who who writes out paperwork about interrogation slash torture slash murder and he goes oh God you guys I've been taking notes this whole time we've got to get rid of these\nSaudi Arabia's latest narrative is that he was killed in a fist fight with officials that were sent to encourage him to return to the kingdom does a fist fight gets so bad that the head comes off\nA oh if Mike Tyson punch me my head would come off yes\nThe Turkish media has leaked and leek and lead to and their narrative is that he was dismembered by this Fifteen man's Saudi hit squad many of whom have ties to the Saudi royal family and his work security for the royal family for a long time\nThe Saudis say they have arrested a bunch of people uh I think Eighteen is the number and that a bunch of high profile intelligence officials have quit as a result of all of this but it's not clear if any of them have any connection\nWhat actually happens to this journalist I'm outside of the one Fifteen a member team member\nWho died in the very suspicious traffic collusion with a couple of days ago in Saudi Arabia it seems like turkey though is absolutely controlling the message on the story doesn't it because\nWe're getting 'em you know a ever since the murder and the appearance of ... showed you the videos of him going into the consulate and never coming back out\nIt seems like once a day turkey releases another bit of information about the story just to keep this thing going\nAnd I don't know if it's because they want everyone to look at them as the good guys and all of this uh because if they allowed him you know if the uh if Turkey's secret police allowed him to go into that conflict\nDidn't wouldn't you think morally slash ethically they have a duty to tell him uh yeah you probably don't\nWant to go in there do you remember the love romance between President Trump and Ted Cruz back in the campaign days no no\nMe neither I Know because it was a lion Ted that's right that these two were not friends said\nTed was really the only one towards the end there who had any sort of chance of taking the nomination away from a away from President Trump\nWell now Ted Cruz is in a fight there in Texas and\nPresident Trump is going to show up and ... for Ted Cruz this\nIs a this is an interesting race I mean between cruising wet Beto O'Rourke we talked about it last week by this rally tonight um it's interesting that they all ... they're pointing out a lot of times in these rallies how many\nSeats the the place holds wherever it is so they're going to be at the Toyotas center tonight in Houston Eighteen thousand seats and the president's gonna make a big deal out of uh having sold a sold out of out of having all of those seats with butts in them making a big deal out of this whole thing so he says that\nLion Ted is now a beautiful cat I don't know if you saw that he was standing outside the White House answering questions from reporters today before he got onto a marine one\nAnd and I didn't ... that these calls and beautiful Ted now that's hysterical\nAnd that's you know he gets Ted Cruz not uh I wouldn't go as beautiful as the descriptor [laughter] [noise] well um that's that's I guess what we're going to hear tonight is beautiful\n... like I Know we can't wait to have the kind of can't wait to hear these two together on stage gosh about each other\nYou think there'll be onstage at the same time\nYes oh I think that I think that Ted Cruz needs the optics of that I mean you look at other Republicans that have ... the president it doesn't go well for them you know Jeff Flake\nA Bob Corker Bob Corker is another one that the Republicans that are embracing him like Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz now that I guess that's the way you have to go because\nPeople are all in with this president right now I mean he's selling out these rallies left and right we talked about how he's already raised over a hundred million for his reelection campaign if you're not in line with this president as a Republican you screwed yeah\nWell and I was mentioned Bernie Sanders he's in Iowa right now campaigning on behalf of ... and the Democrat\nWho is running for Steve nights ... a house seat JD Scholten has out raised king income campaign contributions\nBut Steve night is leading by ten twelve points in some of these polls and that's one of those things that's an example\nOf that you know you you you embrace this president right now you are a stronger than if you don't Michel ... by the way Michael ... has been told 'em\nHe does a lot of money\nThere was two point four million dollar bill to the IRS that came up\nUm tax liens fall in Orange County show that he personally owed at least one point two million on top of the two point four law firm debts one
