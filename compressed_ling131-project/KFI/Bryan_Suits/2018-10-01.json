of that Japanese a term is sue now me and it is the dominant term\nOr throughout the Pacific rim including Indonesia and all I Know is that if I'm if I'm On vacation anywhere in the western Pacific and I'm I'm milling around on the street and I hear a guy yelling this\n\nSo we got a parking garage a bunch of people down on the street\n\nAnd he sang it right there and you can see us the

morning because I Am now part of the I Want to see Brady fail I Want to see the patriots what took you so long Brock crap\nI ... well ... well you know what did it for me I can take or leave the the patriots mhm\nI'm I'm a little over him but then now we're coming up on for years now right Evers ever since give it to Martian write and write and Pete didn't give it to march on\nAnd the patriots stole a Super Bowl from the vastly superior sea hawks that was the moment that I Wish nothing but painful death in ... upon all of them that was it and but battery and that\nSort of lists of used to sit in that order and I got referred then a painful death guys several of 'em and and so\nUh but they but I I don't I don't follow teams that are in the ...\nSo they don't really bother me mhm uh but but now that I smell blood underwater this morning it was Reno dolphins\nI'm up in Fox borrow ... playing better football than the patriots patriots appear to be in disarray no one who can catch the ball right on the team for people who are wondering here's the punch line the patriots dismantled the dolphins\nThirty eight to seven [noise] and it wasn't that close no illegals thirty five nothing before the dolphins court their first touchdown\nSo the reports of the demise of the patriots are a premature\nWell I'll say this this has happened three of the last four seasons where the patriots have gotten off the top stars a couple of ... lost to Kansas City to start last year when I go for that who are good\nAnd people were left the patriots were dead people were saying that Jimmy ... who is now the quarterback of the niners now after the season when you're on jury but back when he was ready to back up you know Brady is old and he's over the hill at thirty seven ... bill educate each other\nTwo of those three seasons where they got blown out and they start out the season one and two they end up going to the super bowl they won won and lost another yeah so this this is par for the cost for the patriots you get off to a slow start for their re run off eight nine wins in a row and become the Patriot act\nAnd a lot of it it's powered by the side show from last year when we find out you know that Tom Brady eats placenta [laughter] and I just started baby stem cells and all this the right to to maintain his youthful look and all that it's there just to perfect yeah and all that but that's just the lesson today never bet against spell check\nAbsolutely now I learned that last year trust me no I left for dead at this time last year and they came back and breakthrough funny this nearly six hundred yards and the super bowl and almost one that won\nThe chargers tried to lose they did I tried Philip literally giving it away past number three ah it wasn't picked
