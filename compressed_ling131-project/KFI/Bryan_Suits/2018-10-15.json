Gordon the groin and rush to the hospital blood was everywhere Ruben female was charged by the bowl during the Spanish national day both fight\nAnd tossed into the air in front of the horrified crowd wise to crowd horrified when I go to I should say not when I go I wouldn't go for a number of reasons but when I watch NASCAR\nOn TV I'm watching with a distinct possibility that\nSomething was going to crash it's not going to shoot I'm not rooting for the crash but the idea of two hundred laps\nJust turning left is not exactly entertainment to me and when they show the highlights of race on ESPN it usually involves the crash\nSo if I'm going to go to a bull fight ... fight I walked to the bowl to get now that I Want the bowl to be able to get some get back because the ball really doesn't know it was like we both find a way you mess with me what I didn't do anything to you and he comes out what this is like his Sixers fears but now I don't know yet\nAnd if the boy we're like why aren't we why are we dropping tears over the ... why are we horrified when the bowl who is going to fight back actually defense itself and possibly win\nNow all credit to Ruben ... because he continued in the bull fight despite bleeding heavily from his crotch area and was able to lead the bowl to bring the fight to a close that's a euphemism for he killed the bull\nSo that's why we um well okay so we know what happened to him\nBut why would you keep going you you just got hit in the groin this should be a time to stop\nNo you know because that's what he fight for his life yet it's over now ... ... he literally the the bull is smelling blood he has to fight for his life\nAt that point they have the ah the clowns that come out and distract ... if if the clowns distracting I'm Out I'm done it's over for the day\nMiles you need to stick to talking about games because when a bullet whipping you ask you run you right but you shouldn't have been in the first place but after he ... he's going into the kill you don't really have that opportunity\nDo they have like those rodeo clowns are coming in step in and to protect him when he's down\nI'm not sure they do in Spanish bull fighting\nIn the video they did they do we got video yeah they do they want to clouds I don't know what they are well okay yeah this is supposed to be indestructible but I'm always rooting for the bull\nAlways ... you know doesn't know what's going on yeah\nOh I think he knows he knows that mattered was trying to kill you yeah but you know that it's for sport and that he's out with it by you know an\nIntellect it's forty times you know the smartest ball on the planet no ... and I get that that's why I'm rooting for the ball because the bull doesn't doesn't understand the wider implications that this is just for entertainment but the bull does it he will die I think he knows that after you get the last two or three times I don't know it's you know they're they're slowly bleed to death\nWhat's going on I don't know after the first time after you Lance bull I think the bull does that okay it's just got real someone was actually trying to hurt the bowl but that's just me\nI'm Glad whenever a bowl wins in the ... I didn't even win this time it's a new story because the bull just got a little bit of ... that just a little bit he got one nudge\nCan I say that and I said yes I think so sometimes you feel like sometimes you do oh man drug gotten to\nKnow them coming up next is Brian suit super hyper local Sunday don't you dare do that job on a walk down the pike yet which will be available okay if I Am six forty a calm so\nStick around for that old and very quickly before ... takes over\nUm I'll be hosting the boys and Girls Club Carson blue door bet a bash on the Eighteenth you can find me politic ... next week I'm going to have to special shows are covering politic on next Saturday and Sunday the twenty twenty first\nAnd I'll be doing the midterms town hall with the irrepressible Jesse ...

Eighteen no [noise] how long ago was that I guess it was to them sixteen I seemed early it seemed like it was\nJust last year I I'm not I'm not sure I didn't know that it did was a jet moving no they were part it was run eleven PM the guy was invading siege Pete somehow we got into the inner fence at at least more and drove around the complete perimeter of the naval air station\nThen got access to the taxi way and the runways drove through the apron word or several dozen iffy teams were part\nOf ... and then it was so dark and the the the tarmac isn't lip\nHe collided with the rear stabilize or even if I were parked F. Eighteen right and ... he trimmed up here's what happened the rear stabilized was exactly at head level and the jeep wrangler yet it cuts the windshield and instantly killed his passenger\nAnd then he came rolling through a stop in a field bailed out of the jeep filled out backwards and he died in the hospital from this piece of F. Eighteen that he cut up I never saw the ending of the story so for people who remember the story march march of twenty sixteen yeah I I I Swear I thought it was just last year\nUm but uh so so the we got the story at night but we never saw what ever happened or what the resolution was well the video has been released from a thing called world police\nThe C. H. P. helicopter video of the entire twenty minutes um ... is released I tweeted it out earlier this afternoon a dart see her place if you remember that story and you like me are wondering how the hell did that happen how does the civilian just break into a naval air station and they collide with an F. Eighteen it's there on the video\nAnd it winds up the siege peak can't get on the base the helicopter lands on the base right right next to the guy the cameras stays on the pilot and the and the observer both get out and go arrested the guy who's busy dying but so if you recall that weird story from two dozen sixteen the video explains the holding the navy wasn't talking\nBecause the navy frankly it was really embarrassed that their security couldn't be reached by C. H. B. C. H. P. and whatever it was a murder said county sheriff or Kern County but ... they were trying to call the base security and say [noise] uh there's a dirt bag\nCircle your base and they they couldn't get anybody at the naval air station to answer except for the tower\nAnd then what's crazy is the guy goes around the south end of the runway starts heading up the taxiway\nAnna F. eighteens coming in for a landing right right next to this as a team does a touching go it lands and it hits the ... and takes off\nBecause they don't they don't then that's a sixty million dollar plane they don't know what this guy's going to do but the the guy in the tower the navy guy and the tower is busy working with ... or you know helicopters and is there a space and all that so if you remember that weird story that is I'm On my Twitter feed that dark secret place\nIt's worth the watch I I got to say and and and uh like do not you can skip forward skip skip Fifteen minutes for it if you want\nBut a ... a watch till the very end because the ... the very end of day\nThey slow down the collusion with the the F. Eighteen and suddenly you can see what happens then the guy comes to a halt and there's a piece of F. Eighteen stabilize are stuck in the windshield and it's a it is just crazy\nIt's a really really when I was just trying to evade it wasn't like a you know of spontaneous territory there now you know that for and it was so weird it was so little information it sounded like\nYou know though an intentional thing so so I think there was a female turned to yeah killed instantly impales with an F. Eighteen stabilizing wow and it looks ugly it's an infrared but it it's crystal clear\nA federal collision in orange a person died in an overnight crashed between a BMW sedan and a big rig on the reins silicon five\nOf the crash took place just before midnight friday on the north down five at Chapman according to C. H. P.\nParamedics pronounced one person to the scene it was unclear whether any other injuries resulted from the collision or so you got the twenty three and more park you got the five and orange and this that and you know and I have a weird feeling it may rain again uh sometime in the next year and this is something that people don't really understand the Californians hotel\nWhere we'd never get rain is that the road so I don't know what's going to happen under fourteen hasn't rained than a year and the fourteen\nUh but the roads build up all the oil and about\nPetro products hydraulic fluid whatever that you're a leaking out of your car millions of cars millions of car hours going over the same roads are dropping all this oil\nThe first rain that comes along gosh forbid warm day that oil
