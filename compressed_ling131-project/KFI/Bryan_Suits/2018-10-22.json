condition\nBack out here for calf and the drive on the freeways next\nEven family owned and operated since Nineteen Ninety three and we've grown to become one of the largest volume super dealers in California in the room where different ...\nKFI listeners are winning boss he said to me\nWhen he starts back up Monday morning between five oh five at five twenty five I [noise]\nIf I Am six forty more stimulating sauce is among Kelly show coming to you from politic are we're not done yet Dr Christopher ...\nUntil you our conversation is a political strategist so we're talking about not only what\nWe would expect to happen but some of the things which are being less discuss what you need to also focused on documents where I'm going to come back to you now\nI started talking about the state house races and we sometimes we want to get caught up in the federal officials but we forget about the so called local officials in our states I'm not only the gubernatorial races were going to watch what's going on in Georgia and Marilyn and so for going to watch those races but\nWhat we think about the state houses are the those constitutions and much was made of how many state houses were lost under President Obama do you foresee something similar happening in the other direction under President Trump\nYeah I think so from the standpoint of state houses is I think people need to understand a couple of things redistricting for example is extremely important it is not just about the governor\nIt's about whether or not the state would pass whatever the governor comes up with so that's number one and I think it's critical to understand that\nUm as we look at Georgia as we look at a number of the other states we look at Alabama for example where there is a record number of black women are running for office in Alabama State houses in state elections really is where it happens and I don't think people understand that\nI mean I have always said if you want to make a difference start running for the school board\nAnd then it goes up from there but I I I just don't think that people get that I think what happens is they want to look at the presidential elections\nAnd that the president has no power really at the end of the day it is all about Congress and so from the ... congressional standpoint it also is about the state houses so we need to start paying attention to that\nWe've had a lot of dialogue pun intended about our dialogues the lack of civility that incivility and it's getting to a fever pitch we can talk about as I've mentioned another conversations we can talk about the Proud Boys we could talk about anti far I think it's indicative\nOf what's in gimmick in America will we don't like each other we don't trust each other we don't look at each other\nAs Americans where do you see this going ultimately\nWell I think that the whole issue of the division I think that's what under that is in fact what's undermining the republic\nIs this division we are divided ourselves into a number of camps ultimately the republic cannot sustain itself if we continue to do that and this whole idea of attacking people personally because we don't agree with their position\nIs sad not only is it sad it's unfortunate for the republic\nI've always made the argument that it does start in in at the top I Do believe the president has a disproportionate level of responsibility to set the tone and the mood\nFor how we interact as Americans what would you make of the president more recently in terms of regardless of what you may think about the Kavanaugh hearings what he had to say about Dr Ford in a rally what do you have to say about the the reporter who was body slam\nDoes that have a place or not well\nI think it does and I think if I were advising the president I Would say focus on the issues\nAnd not on the personal attacks because I think that's a huge distraction we've got to really focus on what the issues are\nLook from a political standpoint we can disagree on the fundamental issues but this whole idea of attacking people you know based on the fact that you don't like them or any of those kinds of things I think again\nYou know my slogan is not make America great again it's make America nice again because I think that's critical\nBut the president would say let me go Trump supporter for a moment but it works for the president his approval ratings are at the highest point or very close to it\nAt any point in his presidency\nIt ... if anything it might have shifted the balance in the conception of the Capitol Hill hearings um he is leaning and his supporters have rewarded him for it so what would be then the impetus for him to back off anything that he's been doing even though we may find it socially and palatable\nWell I think so so here's the thing it's not only about the base it's about the base plus independence I mean Democrats are not going to vote for the person we get that we understand that\nBut it is also about the independence and I think that's a critical critical a position that we have to look at does that work in the short term yes it is extremely effective in the short term I think he's a master of doing that\nThe question becomes what about the long term effects and I think we have to think about that um as a nation if you\nWere I'm a consultant to the Democratic party ... what would you tell them to do for ... for the next six months\nFirst of all I Would tell them to have a very clear message the messages all over the place I don't know what it is for a moment to moment and while you can disagree with the president the message is always crystal clear\nMobs for jobs ... exactly Mohsen jobs if mobs jobs and caravans\nI mean and and and and that's the thing the message is absolutely clear Democrats fall into that trap\nAnd they are the ones who chased something down the rabbit hole\nRather than coming up say the agenda can't be we hate Trump if that's the agenda you're gonna lose it's not it's not going to happen whether you explicitly stated or not yeah it's not gonna it's gonna work for the question becomes what are you gonna do what your position and unfortunately for Democrats\nIt's not clear I'm like okay so what are you doing\nI mean and that's the that's the important thing messaging is extremely important consistency is extremely important but here's the thing with Democrats it is at some point you have to start kind of stop\nBeing so arrogant in terms of who's ... who's the best candidate is a core is a ... is a Christian ... if you'd have to stop that\nEdge because from the Republican side it's clear it's Trump should he decide to run in twenty twenty that's clear and as people are talking about twenty twenty for example people are saying you know Nikki Haley said she won't run against Trump\nShe did not say that if Trump did not win that she would not run she never said that\nThis is the ... show he is Dr Christopher ... and that's why we love having him on because he drops pearls wisdom that you just don't get anywhere else ... don't let it be too long before we actually get to sit across from each other again absolutely my front always good to see my brother\nThis is the vocabulary okay if I Am six forty bore stimulated talk more from political on and just a moment now to the newsroom for an update\nLike

ooh and fly I think that'd be a great reason to wake up at six AM every day in and ask I mean so you could fly out of the country you're so I just read private\nPilot then go on to commercial you know and then you know have a plan to be able to go anywhere you want\nI think you'd have to travel before you decide what am I going to do with that five hundred million yeah and I think you know definitely but but but uh I might that would be my number one fear it would be a not not having a reason to get up in the morning so I Would want to\nDo stuff like ... by a bookstore or I was thinking Barnes and noble\nIt might work but you know I mean I wouldn't want I I Would feel like a total slug if I weren't getting up doing a thing could be a bargain price for the yeah and also and then you know the you know put a sports bar well okay you can burn through money all your life you can have the greatest sports bar ever with a you know boring and about two weeks ago yeah\nYou know and uh but you could buy the hire other people that are on it or you know and and I have a Ferrari dealership or or whatever to get it gives you that amazing freedom or the SOS ... but I mean it would confused between that much money\nAnd and here and I don't I don't know if if other people have this in their DNA but I Would feel like a total de if I didn't try to you know do something good\nWith the mindset of a foundation humanitarian yeah and and ah so I I don't know about it 'cause I can because it is you know just pure luck you guys ... I didn't do anything but walk into a store and buy the ticket that would feel a little guilty about that\nSo there'll be there'll be that there is one two three million a hundred million\n[laughter] yeah what what are your huh well All right you generally go right over to do what would you do with the money or oh he's far as being like the length of his whatever\nI'll definitely invest like half of it and I are are not pay quarter of it right away and to pick winners and kind of a wide smart you know I you know I was gonna invested Mexican bail bonds [laughter] ever going to go\nA ... like they know quarter of it to my family and uh and that's they lose my address yeah oh yeah I mean how you would never have ... ... I mean I Know a Joshua tried to buy the Dodgers\nWell yeah that one of those that\nWould you do that job for one reason why I think you know effort in like in reality you know of any kind of all the time I buy the Dodgers 'cause that's the only way to attack would be every dime and let me I I'd go I'd invest I think I should say and I are of the same way that it wouldn't it be cool to buy a small radio station somewhere new when did it cool\nAnd and you know higher higher do staff and all that but that that would be fun to expensive\nOh that's right for the license and all those so that no that new stuff for you [laughter] but uh now that'd be that that that would be fun but ah so anyway there you go there but I but like I say I'm motivated because I I don't I don't have\nAny help whatsoever I'm going to win that said I Would just hate when the numbers come up on Tuesday I'm going to say I want to\nPick those ... and I never do I always do the automatic what'd you feel all ambition leave your body and soul I wouldn't\nI Would I Would I'd want to always either I'd want I wouldn't have to sit in some high end crappy restaurant a wheelchair and talk about this idea that I'm working on a ...
