eleven o'clock so to a wind you up a little bit by the way if you follow me on the Twitter machine or this might be redundant I was talking about this uh Monday Tuesday\nAt dark secret place and how the way this works is like this we have to back up a couple of weeks to southern Iran a city called ... in uh the the southern\nI'm In Iran Iraq border region this is an area of Iran or where the the borders very blurry and ethnically the largest uh amount of the majority population in southern southern southern Iran\nOr near the ah the head of the\nPersian Gulf war the two great members of the Tigris and Euphrates\nCome in the majority of the population in Iran are Arabs they're they're a Shia Arabs like in Iraq or as well but the ethnic Persians have for centuries are oppressed and discriminated against the ethnic Arabs\nIn Iran and during the Iran Iraq War a many many of the Iranian Arabs were detained and disappeared or for years and years years because they were frankly were suspected they respected of being disloyal to the Islamic republic\nOr in Tehran ... dominated\nBy Persians speaking Farsi course in southern Iran the Iranian Arabs primarily speak Farsi gets the national language of Iran\nI'm so two weeks ago there was a military parade in ...\nAnd\nI don't know where a group of armed men dressed in military uniforms began spraying the military parade [noise] and the guys in the parade are not armed I mean that they have rifles on their shoulders they've magazines and the weapons but they have no ammo in their\nAh because you know how Anwar Sadat wound up you just in that part of the world you just don't give passing groups ah ammo unless there's award winning\nSo anyway ah a couple of dozen Iranian soldiers were killed a few of the attackers were killed as well they turned out to be Iranian Arabs the Iranians immediately blamed who else the United states Israel and Saudi Arabia\nUm as far as the U.S and Israel goes um they're probably my way out of the rain fan out of the ballpark on that\nBut it's a fairly open secret that the Saudis have been fomenting unrest in Iran for a couple of years as a counterpoint\nTo the uranium supporting the uh the the coup in Yemen the who the coup\nSo the Saudis and said well we can do that we got Arabs we have pre planted Arabs we have millions of Arab sitting there in Iran\nWho don't like their Persian masters and are surely out all those millions if we pay them enough we can find guys will form\nA resistance were well it turns out there been resistance groups for years in around somebody was no it hasn't been really hard the bottom line for the Saudis to get a pay off in supporting a independent minded Arabs in in Iran in the eastern part of Iran\nThey've been doing the same thing with different ethnicities as well so the Iranians know full well who's behind this and who's doing it and does the CIA know about this and even support it probably is the Saudis want to pay for it we were we going to say no to him right okay so so there's that\nIsrael probably is doing nothing except sitting there nodding and eating popcorn gag however ... it was what the Iranians did next that was most concerning the Iranians\nAre immediately blame us Israel Saudi Arabia and they said we're going to retaliate\nUm these uh these nations think they can challenge our freedom and the Islamic republic's independence they will uh they will pay the price\nAnd for some reason the clear blue sky ... some ISIS group claimed credit for the attack\nIs if we are ISIS in Iran and we did and that seems pretty far fetched but what the Iranians did was rather than to retaliate against Saudi Arabia or Israel or the United states the Iranian said even though you three did it we're going to retaliate against ISIS okay well how do you do that\nWell the Iranians have not bad indigenous intermediate range ballistic missiles and on TV\nUm last week a around Sunday night they showed a or not live they showed a package\nOf a three to four Iranian missiles being launched near simultaneously in an area very close to the Iraqi border\nSo four missiles possibly take off our on TV at night they're painted the missile say death to America death to Israel that the Saudi Arabia ... where are they going\nWhere else Syria or they go to Syria and they bomb suspected ISIS positions\nI'm I'll tell you where and what the real ... when when the when the missiles hit\nThey hit with in three miles of American forces in Syria was that a mistake no that was the point I'll tell you about it when we come back right after this number two of the dark secret place also the missing head of Interpol\nI'll tell you what Interpol is whether or not they can arrest you and why was a former Chinese

advice our weapons are air support and everything so it's into that strip\nThat the Iranians last week fire these six missiles ... they know damn well what they were doing\n'em now it could have gone a foggy and it could have landed and killed a couple of dozen Americans but the Iranians were reasonably sure that it would not so they green ... the mission they said All right you know we've we've been secretly\nAnd it's usually openly testing these missiles for Fifteen Years\nSurely they can do this or we have enough confidence in them so they said do you absolutely positively guarantee that you can hit close enough to the Americans that they can hear it go boom but um we can plausibly say we were not targeting them and they were given that insurance assurance that they said right\nLaunched the pansies or launched the zoo for car a missile so they did\nAnd uh like I said last hour they had things painted on them like uh what are they death to Israel death to America and death to the house is out in the royal family Saudi Arabia and this is all of course tweeted out but as far as news agency before they launched the whole thing so up\nThere were a bunch of cops who I basically if if a Nigerian this training you how to be open honest and on corrupt then you got real problems\nAnd of course if you said that out loud than you were just a bad guy and you're anti un ah

authorize a fly over because this is going to be on November tense\nTwo thousand Eighteen any of you Marines out there know what November ... says\nIt's a birthday in the marine corps\nAnd so it's

Eighteen fly over over Lancaster when we dedicate early or me avenue\nAnd if there's any resistance I Will alert you and you can email I'll give you address is to email until the marine corps that um that earlier me\nAre represented the marine corps to the world and to America in in movies and TV ... probably more than any other marine in the past Thirty years\nUh and that for many many people
