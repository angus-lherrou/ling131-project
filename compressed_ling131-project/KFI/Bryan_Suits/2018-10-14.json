or I'm signed off on this and\nSaid that yeah there is audio and and ah and video of ... going in there or not being worn by anyone\nIn the church we also think knew about this but they let him go in because they see this as a wedge issue and boy is it\nUh and uh so we we we think he's dead and the Saudis are ordered it and uh we we have enough about the ear balls on NBS and Saudi Arabia that we we probably are tracking the\nThe the the cell phone calls and all that so it sounds to me like a Trump is aware of this and that's what it sounds like to me um but here's where the next uh the first a shoe drops\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee has served the president with a letter invoking the ... the global Magnitsky Act\n[noise] oh the Magnitsky Act is named after a Russian journalist who was probably killed by ... like all the other young healthy journalist in their twenties and thirties who fall out of windows and and drink tea and I'll and a and I'm not ... the ... the former cage beget\nArmy natural journalist is named after a journalist and it was aimed at when reporting but the reason was to global Magnitsky Act is that it forces in American government response to any a foreign nation that are intentionally targets journalists for being journalist\nHere's what the\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee said in a letter to president Donald Trump US Senators Bob Corker blah blah blah and then does Lindsey Graham\nPatrick Leahy et cetera uh chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee on state foreign operations in related programs triggered an investigation and global Magnitsky sanctions determination regarding the disappearance of jumped to ...\nUh this law which was a signed into law by President Obama I'm a ... directs the president

musical tie and perhaps from Princeton studying rabies Thomas Insel monitors\nThough in Arabic and when they go\nAt least we don't think he speaks English so anyway I directly to replace branch who tend your next hour by review of first men the Armstrong movie that just a debuted\nThis weekend so uh what are what are the next steps will I might take that the president knows full well that the\nClaim a leaked by turkey that a Saudi citizen American resident was lured and and and thanks red circle army a on a Twitter are pointing out that he needed proof that he was divorced from his first wife\nOr because they intended to get married he and his Turkish ... can get married ASAP\nAnd he needed proof of the divorce to get the Turkish marriage marriage license so um the the uh the Turks are aware who ... to show he is anyone is an enemy of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia is a friend of theirs or at least an asset to possibly be used\nThey knew he was just an bowl or his fiance are in in fact had had asked about protection from uh from national police et cetera they knew this and they they knew he was going to go into the Saturday consulate uh they\n... ... according to one theory knew full well what was lying in wait for him in there because they have\nSpies in there in the form of the Turkish citizens who work in the consulate they knew full well when he was walking into [noise] but his usefulness as a\nEnemy of the regime and the Saudis citizen himself was outweighed by his usefulness or as a dead guy that they could revealed to the world especially the United states because here we are the United states with are are allowed to talk\nAbout the human rights and we went through the Cold War sing that we're morally superior to the Soviet Union because of these ah these darn human rights and we have an act of the Magnitsky Act\nNamed after a journalist so boot and killed because of you know human rights and an old by the way uh we we point out and pointing their finger at air to one and turkey all the time has violators of human rights so we painted ourselves into this corner\nAnd the Turks dropped his hand grenade\nUm his fiance as ... as outside the consulate the she talks to her friends back in Washington the Washington Post is was bound to get out that he was missing because last Thursday he was just missing or the Turks kicked it up a notch or rather whoever leaked\nOr that he actually was lured in there tortured murdered and then dismembered they even provided learn details about a bone saw a forensic specialist et cetera and what does the net effect of this well I just read you officially the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\nHas to invoke the Magnitsky Act they have to serve a letter to the president that directs a letter to investigate this and and give it a determination whether or not it was created so this or not it sounds to me like Trump knows that there is and then the next step is\nThe sanctions so the next measurement is how hard of the sanctions how hard of a wedge\nA does the murder of ... drive between the U.S in Saudi Arabia and make no mistake I'm not blaming the church on this I'm just saying that they knew this was coming and they saw what a perfect way to drive a wedge because here's the deal the Saudis could have simply said he left\nHe he ... he walked out\nHis fiance is wrong we don't know where we didn't we were not the boss of him he walked in he got his paperwork you walked out that was that's all we know and that's what they thought was going to happen they didn't know the extent of Turkish surveillance on their consulate which is now a matter of public record\nAnd so the Turks got what they want the United states is now deeply embarrassed because we're closely allied with the country but clearly has little or no consideration to human rights and we have ban every single American president has been a but now we're getting called up\nAnd so the how far does it go do we actually drop relations with Saudi Arabia that doesn't seem likely doesn't seem likely ... and here's the other bottom line about this\nUm in two months nobody's going to remember a there may be sanctions on Saudi Arabia we might slow the a delivery of ... teams to Saudi Arabia something like that but it will be tied to their war in Yemen they will be tied to the murder of this guy\nAnd it'll be forgotten in in a few months so\nUh so that's what I'm saying but this will not be\nThe uh the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand\nIn Syria vote which was the other murder in the Balkans a hundred and four years ago\nThat led to the worst war in the uh when the world's history until of course the second one uh ... this murder in the Balkans probably dies with a whimper and not a bunch of alliances going bang for four years at the cost of millions of lives but the wars have started our less\nUh we'll be back next hour my review a first bands during Ryan Gosling what can go wrong it is right to self Neil Armstrong American Hero naval aviator plants in American flag on the moon what can go wrong\nWell if you don't put that in the movie that might go wrong or that um are coming up it is it Arctic replace our number three right up in this case I Am sick for a more stimulating talk\nKFI listeners are winning how I found out just won a thousand dollars by maybe your next your next

fired from a pickup truck around eight twenty tonight near the ... restaurant in lounge\nIs the flag waving part the Canadian director intentionally\nDownplayed the landing of men on the moon and bring them safely back\nAnd intentionally admitted the actual planting of the American flag on the moon I'm the reason was because he wanted it to be a a worldwide story a step but a story about Neil Armstrong [noise] and\nUm this this was kind of my problem with it uh\nI understand that um your intent as as a Canadian is to highlight the human achievement uh putting a man on the moon\nBut your other intent as a director of a film I'm assuming is to put a movie on the screen that people would want to pay to see and this is my absolute confusion with why would you miss the things that humid I'll get into this and detailed you're coming up\nAs you can tell I'm not going to advise you to go see the movie because I'm assuming if you are if you're a dark secret place listener\nUm then you you expect to see in a movie\nOr a movie about a singular American achievement you expect to see\nSomething about America something something about that this was a unique thing that only Americans could have done and and that's what I Do that that's what I expect\nAnd that's what the right stuff delivered um the other thing that the rights of delivered was historical fact it was a historical fact\nThat Russia put a man in space first I'm a and and he orbited our first man it nor but he just went ballistic Alan Shepard went down range as they say into the Atlantic I'm a\nAnd the uh the movie shows American achievements especially the part of the movie\nThat took place on this date in Nineteen forty seven when Chuck Yeager ... became the first human being to ah to break the sound barrier it's um it it ... it's a proud\nAmerican achievement that had happened here in Southern California in Nineteen forty seven and we expect them to go to see the movies to maybe take some credit for it like for can you imagine saving private Ryan which by the way is a completely fictional movies very very very loosely based\nOn a similar incident but uh it's safe otherwise fictional movie and what is that movie open up with what does anybody remember what's saving private Ryan opens up with\nIt opens up with a slow motion shot of an American flag back ... by the sun and the the flag is so so dark because of the back letting it almost looks like it's grey and black strikes but the movie opens up\nWith a an American flag flying over the uh the cemetery at Normandy, France and the next shot or all those headstones um and\nAnd that that movie from its outset\nYou know that that movie is is going to glorify the heroes of D Day um and and it does so spectacularly that's part of the reasons saving private Ryan\nOpened up on Christmas Day uh Nineteen Ninety eight was because um the Spielberg gambled and said you know what there is obviously some hyper realistic war violence in this movie\nBut this story is so moving and so real and it gives us a a vessel to highlight these astounding heroes and what they did from D Day of the next couple of weeks\nSo he released a movie in a Christmas from Nineteen Ninety eight and ... and it was an instant classic uh I remember seeing it in Bosnia Spielberg actually paid for a theater to be built at eagle base in Bosnia\nI remember watching the movie actually with some German some ah some German very marked a truck drivers that run the base a and you know they were uncomfortable and the whole thing and it was a bit uncomfortable but it was a unabashedly American Movie\nAnd first man could be in that pantheon but it it is not\nAnd I'll I'll tell you why when we come back primarily because well a spoiler alert the the conundrum here is it's a movie that wants to depict the heroic life of Neil Armstrong but it leaves out two of the things that Armstrong himself we're proudest of\nOr will be back right after ... dark secret

movie first\nMan and I wouldn't want to see a good movie I say something like\nUm yeah that rock as you go see it quit your job go see it right now and I was prepared I was psyched up for first ma'am I'm I was thinking about how can you after this movie I buy I get it the Canadian guy doesn't want to include the planting of the American flag on the moon if the movie's good enough I might forgive that\nI just might but it has to be really really really good\nLike a like doing Cox uh in in the studio good if you've never seemed to be ... you're you're just last year\nBut [noise] anyway this is my my final take away on this my final impression is is\nThis director took a sure thing homerun iconic American Movie\nAnd these ... I mean I again I got to say the flight scenes and all that are spectacular the sequence the final thirty minutes when that when a Aldrin and Armstrong just send to the moon and Armstrong and you for the first time in a movie ever\nYou see this perfect scale model of lamb you see that they hatch that Armstrong goes down\nThe ladder you see it in real time uh when really it's thing they did is they kept the audio from Houston they didn't have an actor recreate that audio so you hear those radio transmissions that we all know whereas like in Apollo Thirteen they recreated them when you hear the original transmissions\nNo one's losing their crap\nThat one's acting their test pilots\nSo in this that moon sequence is spectacular and Armstrong ... by the way spoiler alert in three seconds I'll tell you whether or not he landed on the moon\nThree two one he lands on the moon with Buzz Aldrin um he goes down the ladder is ah the ladder he says the iconic a first words on the moon ah or I mean you know outside the lamb and then he says ah Houston I'm going to step off the limb now\nAnd he steps out the limb and there is a spectacular amazingly shot\nSeen 'em that starts with Armstrong's gold visor down and the pans to what he sees it pans all the way around on the rise in the moon back to Armstrong and\nThe lamb in the background and it says the United states and all that\nI mean yeah I ... I I choked up ... it's a spectacular scene and the reason I'm now I'm mad at the movie is because the things that admitted make made it such a distraction I couldn't like the movie ... let me start with for me the the second biggest one\nI'm Neil Armstrong was a naval aviator he went to Purdue University at the age of Seventeen under a thing called the Holloway program Nineteen forty seven\nHolloway program sent you to a college to get an engineering degree for two years then you went to flight training for two years and then you flew in the fleet for a year then you went back and completed your degree\nArmstrong did this he met Janet Armstrong I forgot her maiden name but he met her at Purdue he goes back to Purdue or gets his degree and then flies in the navy\nAnd guess what Neil Armstrong and not only has a naval aviator he's a combat veteran hundred and thirty something missions or um say like Seventy two missions backed down one mission he was so low\nHe lost three feet of his right wing 'cause he collided with a telephone pole in North Korea um and he he was able to bring the stricken craft back into South Korea\nOr an object out he was going to try trying to make it to see but he didn't and he had a buddy pick him up in a jeep\nI'm Neil Armstrong made it crystal clear\nI'm Tom Wolfe in the right stuff makes it clear Armstrong in\nInterviews makes made it clear he was a naval aviator and he felt that he owed the United states of America and the U.S navy a debt he could never repay the navy gave him this life you wanted to be an engineer he wanted to go to Purdue navy sent them for two for two up or do they found out he was pretty damn good at flying plus he was a genius\nUm he uh he a ladder roles basically into NASA as NASA grew out\nUh and and went from the national advisory committee on they're not X. two NASA national\nUh uh aerospace and say\nFace immunization or national aerospace administration weight am I getting it wrong national anyway NASA um\nHe maintained a reserve commission as a a naval aviators naval\nOfficer so in the movie when he is sitting down for a interviews kind of a law the right stuff to be in the Gemini program they picked him in a long hallway\nIn civilian clothes a suit and tie next to all these navy pilots in our air force pilots who are sitting ram Rob strayed looking straight ahead I guess I imagine\nThat's what this Canadian director uh has in mind that uh that American officers pilots sit and do it all way\nUm so he sits down suit and tie another guy comes along in a suit and tie and they introduced\nEach other it was a a it was a of another naval aviator and um and NASA guy as his last name was si se and they introduce each other and he says Armstrong and shake hands and the other guy says see and he says are you a civilian pilots are civilian and Armstrong go yeah you to", "show_name": "Bryan Suits", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "14"}
