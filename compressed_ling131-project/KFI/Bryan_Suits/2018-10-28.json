accident\nLike of untold proportions that you know resulted in his death and all but he ... he just got off the results of his death and look there are several videos that he has posted where he's jumping out of plane hanging on planes doing stuff on planes wrapping\nLet me do you remember Steve Irwin [laughter] remember Steve or when it's ... hard okay he's dead now\nRight he will someone else who was doing dangerous things just in a different way just because you didn't die the first thirty five times you do something really stupid or dangerous it does not mean\nThirty six times you won't

yeah like a band or Cajun lax it's I mean not a spy but he was yeah video I travel a strong\nMica yeah OK but just like I said at the beginning of last segment I'm not a thrill seeker because I don't like to flirt with death because there's a good chance like I don't gamble don't look when I go to Vegas and gamble why because I don't want to deal with the reality of losing\nAre we missing out

this guy was living on the edge more we missing\nAnd that's why he died oh I get no joy out of jumping out of an airplane look I have a brother in law was like eighty second airborne and that's what he did in service of America there was a point to it he wasn't doing it to be a thrill seeker he was doing it because he's a bath\nAnd he was protecting America and it was one of his six tours\nI'm not that guy and I'm not going to\nDo it it's like oh let's go bungee jump no I'm not that guy I don't do that kind of stuff\nLook I'm not saying John James has me running over to you know knots berry farm to gun accelerator ever again I'm just saying now that I learned more about this young man and his life and\nHis music that I think so I don't like it but it sounds like everything that's out there the music world may have lost someone that we could have seen jumping out of planes in the future doing something that yeah those of us were maybe a little square would consider dangerous I don't know this is ...\nYes yes the music world lost someone but the music world lost someone because the music world was also complicit in his stupidity he was doing this for a music video he wasn't doing it to raise money for kids stricken with cancer okay\nBut what if John James it live and he opened up a sky diving school where he videoed children with special needs whatever maybe jumping out of planes and all that far fetched\nMaybe it's not I'm just saying the things that the shuttle man could have done he could have started a foundation for maybe indoor sky diving and doing videos for kids\nBut ... but he can't because he's dead ... D games here that is dead I won't even give him the respect of spelling the word correctly John has gone that is he's going why because he jumped his assets and actually he walked out on the wing\nOf a plane while in flight it went into a death spiral that while they call it a death spiral and he ended up dead\nAt the end of the death spiral because this Harris you was open to late if it was opened at all and he hit the ground terminal velocity do you know what they call a terminal velocity\n'cause his ashes terminated done John J. need to we'll never hear me get it don't you ever play that Horowitz from this program [laughter]\nBrian suits is up next and he would never play something that horrible and I bet you if he jumped out of a plane it would be for good reason not to film a music video the dark secret places coming up next\nNever jump out of a permanent a perfectly good airplanes coming up next on the dark secret place has been an outbreak of sky penises we'll get to the bottom of that also\nAccount down of the best submarine movies ever with hunter killer out there in the theaters this weekend the one of the best submarine movies and what are the worst and why this is ...

going in each hand because he didn't have explosives he basically had an accelerant he had\nA what would you like you you would do with\nA gun powder gun gunpowder uh when it come bus it creates a huge over pressure and it it's ... it's a very simple but effective pipe bomb but do you need a way to introduce a spark in the way you do it that way as you stick to ends of the the negative and positive deep into the\nGunpowder weather by you know an eighth inch away from each other\nSo that there is the spark that arts across when when there's a chart and that's what this looks like it looked like this guy didn't have access to real explosives but [noise] so in other words like I told your insurance if you told me to mock up a pipe bomb and make it look so as to induce\nAre you a a ... response from law enforcement that because they would look at that and assume that it was real bomb because that's how you stay alive\nIf something looks like a bomb probably a real bond you assume right\nAnd the the thing that made that let me down the path of these just being I Am really badly thought out gag just to terrify people was the fact that every time somebody in the media asked the press conferences on a Wednesday and Thursday\nOr these real bombs the answer five times in a row on Thursday was well when the bomb techs or law enforcement sees us they have to assume it's a real bomb not the question that was not the question we all know that by Thursday we know\nThat if it looks like a bomb it's Bob\nOkay that's that's how you stay alive in that line of work and that's a really crappy line of work there was a joke in Bosnia because Bosnia was the most shorter the DMZ it's the most mind place on earth\nAnd [noise] the the joke amongst NATO de mining engineers was a a de mining engineer makes to mistakes in his life one\nIs becoming a de mining engineer but I'm so the actually that requires is [noise]\nUm [noise] so we yeah we get it you have to assume they're all a real bombs but that wasn't the question the question was\nAre these real bombs and they they were being really call you about that and so that led me to believe well you know what they're not but they don't want to give that up because they they have the ... they have the guy by the short hairs you just have made the arrest it well now they're saying that they really were\nA that they were functioning bombs though probably low power so the important thing for the prosecution is guess what\nThis guy's intent was his needs to be real bombs so that you're Ninety nine percent at the conviction if he stands up and says your honor I'm such a meat had I knew I could make a real bond these are not intended to be real bombs while they did have an explosive rather an accelerant\nOr in them so his intent was to make a functioning bomb and it appears to me that this guy never tested it he just went on YouTube and found somebody and never went up to the woods and tested it or whatever so he replicated the same mistake what Fifteen times\nAnd none of them went up and also the second thing was who uses a timer for a bomb that you sent through the mail\nThe U.S postal service office eight exactly Swiss rail and that seems so amazingly haphazard to me that it it it made me think this has to be a either an evil genius or an idiot and so uh by by friday a idiot was the leading\nA leading candidate and that turned out to be an actual idiots um so uh but but nevertheless um it's a that is an evidently part of our political culture right now this this is a guy

movie Olympics has fallen by the terrorist attack in the White House and how bad than congratulations I haven't seen it a evidently it was a over the top action thriller and I guess Gerard Butler plays a secret service guy or whatever\nThis time out there are butler is the skipper of the U.S navy nuclear powered hunter killer Virginia Class submarine it is time or a rip roaring darn good submarine movie\nAnd until that comes along here comes hunter killer and I'll say this right up front I haven't seen it\nI have not seen it but also say this I probably will see it because I Do have a weakness for the submarine movie as I think not just military but most movie aficionados have a weakness for submarine movie for a couple of reasons\nI and I do think psychologically there's one big reason it's that very little violence actually is I witnessed in a submarine Moore movie you know there's no there's no bayonet on on the ballot submarine there's no hand to hand combat is technology versus technology\nAnd I would defer to actual psychiatrist or psychologist to delve into a of of general popularity amongst the general public I I think by and large no one can say no to a to a gripping submarine thriller right\nUm so let's divide these into to sub genres in and we'll we'll talk about these um hunter killer is the classic genre it is a the group of men\nAre in the submarine again stay unseen foe using Geils which cleverness and technology to gain the upper hand on a a near peer or or a ... almost technologically equal or or better\nOr so and of course for years and years and years for the Cold War the photo was the Soviet Union right we've been missing the Soviet Union for years because [noise] pardon me um I'll I'll say this upfront\nAlthough the submarine films that have ever come out let's all just admit something right off the bat right here right now hunt for Red October\nComes from a great novel by Tom Clancy and it made its way to the big screen and didn't lose a hell of a lot in fact in many ways you could say gain hunt for Red October is probably everyone is number one\nSubmarine movie and unlike many submarine movies\nOr when it when it's on TV you you tend to stay on that channel many other stars for a generation some tried uh their own submarine movie Harrison Ford or Liam Neeson a and others now Gerard Butler but hunt for Red October combines all those things I talked about\nA and again from a from a from terrific source material and it does a really good job\nSo let's not even discuss hunt for Red October\nUm but there are two sub genres in submarine movies K. there is like I say I'm a group of plucking guys sometimes are out of contact with their commander on their own and they're fighting a very very clever enemy the other submarine genre is\nOh no or machine is broken were stuck on the bottom of the ocean or whatever uh the the nuclear plant has gone wacky a or squid attacked us or whatever and we have to fight the machine itself\nTo ah just to get back up to the services survive\nI'm I I don't mind those and you could say that the Harrison Ford Liam Neeson movie canine teams the widow maker or might be sort of the the
