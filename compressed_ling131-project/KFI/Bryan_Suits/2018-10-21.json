that John Bolton senior national security adviser um is it vice president Trump to announce that we are going to be leaving the intermediate nuclear forces treaty or signed a in Nineteen eighty eight but between Reagan and Gorbachev\nUh this is a treaty that regulates the deployment of ground launch cruise missiles in Europe in a medium medium range ballistic missiles\nOr in Europe as well and it is a a a legacy the Cold War the negotiations began a Nineteen eighty one when Reagan became a president and the negotiations started because\nThe Soviets began deploying a specific kind of ground launch cruise missile as well as a\nA a mole bile ICBM called the ss twenty in Europe and the Europeans are in in the late seventies never mind what people on the street were demonstrating about\nEuropean freaked out about this because it was crystal clear that there would not just be if if there was a war between NATO and Warsaw Pact that the Soviet Union was prepared to clearly use nuclear weapons why else would they have developed them and deployed them to Europe so [noise] for the United states\nIn order and this was so badly misunderstood in the eighties um ... about why Reagan was brilliant about some of this stuff\nFor the United states to just simply said to the Soviet Union without a treaty in place hey withdraw those missiles wouldn't have worked so Reagan said okay well I'm I'm deploying ground launch cruise missiles to England in Italy\nI'm Andy pushing to our own medium range nuclear missile\nA Reagan's intent in announcing that deployment and then going forward with that deployment was to redeploy them it was to have poker chips on the table\nSo that the Soviet Union kid now look and say well you know we don't like those there either\nSo now what do we do so the intermediate nuclear forces treaty was signed a negotiation went from eighty one to eighty five finally die was signed in Nineteen eighty eight and that led to the ... the destruction and inspection\nAnd verification in in Europe and in the Soviet Union by Russian parties here in the U.S and Europe in American inspectors in Russia and it was probably one of the most successful or nuclear treaties of of the eighties and has done really really well\nI'm ... now the problem just like all these treaties either party can back out given enough or a dance warning in this case it's six months\nBack in two thousand seven Vladimir boot and said that they were pulling out of the ins\nOr because the United states was deploying the GM be the ground based missile defense our ground based midcourse missile defense in Poland Czechoslovakia and these are stated intent was that these missiles were going to protect Europe\nFrom a potential Iranian a nuclear attack or or nuclear black male\nOn Europe the Russia's looked at it and they said well isn't that convenient isn't that convenient that your violating the anti ballistic missile defense treaty which by the way we withdrew from in in Nineteen Ninety One your uh the Russians that you're violating the INS where those missiles well those missiles are actually not covered\nBy the intermediate nuclear forces agreement they they were covered by the ATM the anti ballistic missile a treaty which we we withdrew from well so the Russians are began deploying a cruise missile that is specifically\nA banned by the treaty or in two thousand fourteen and two thousand twelve or the the Russian response to our ground based missile defense in Czechoslovakia\nAnd Poland was to deploy a cruise missile that absolutely violates the inter intermediate nuclear forces street so\nUm what the Trump Administration is doing is probably next few days or they're going to give official notice to the Russians and we're going to be leaving the IMF treaty and six months\n[noise] you're going to hear ... from from every ultra liberal uh disarmament expert like the Monterey Institute\nUp in Monterey a and others and they're going to say oh this is a repeat of the Cold War and this is disastrous and the whole thing\nUm it's their job to do that they these are the self anointed nuclear experts who've that that have never seen in agreement that they don't love and they're missing the entire lesson of the original I announced that there would not have been that treaty there never would have been a Soviet Union at the table signing that treaty if Reagan had not escalated\nThe uh the nuclear tension by providing\nSomething that we could then buy by giving ourselves leverage that we can pull back um ... coming up on two years now\nI've seen how Trump operates apparently there's a rift between chief of staff John Kelly a and and John Bolton about this but clearly Trump's intent here is to make the sounds were getting out of the IMF tree I'm we're going to do it in six months\nAnd in doing that he probably is going to drive flattering food and back to the table there is no way that this treaty gets torn up the Russians like it as much as we do\nBut if if we don't do something and then we don't have leverage to tell them to get that cruise missile out this uh we're never going to admit that the the ground based a missile defense just like the one at Vandenberg and the ones in Alaska\nUm are intended for the Soviet Union on on the surface on the face of it I should say oh you you don't shoot for missiles um and and I have an effect on on a Russian first strike this is intended for a country like Iran but we'll see where it\nGoes you're like I say you're going to hear a lot of candor walling about this but it appears to me to be a a negotiating tactic and really not not a a heck of a lot more the real question real problem is\nWho was deposed by the British Soviets\nIn World War two or the uh Nineteen fifty three coup by the CIA none of that crap if you're wearing a uniform\nAnd your mission in Nineteen eighty was to come up with a plan to account for every single one of those hostages and bring them safely home to the u._s. you really don't care\nAbout any of the cultural baggage for CIA baggage or any of that crap so that is not a planning consideration for us all we know is it's a non permissive environment on the ground as we say and other people they're asking hate us oh well\nThat's how it works generally when America goes to war\nSo their mission is um\nGo into the embassy compound and safely removed all the American citizens and their dependents who were there um and guarantee they're safe exit out of Iran to uh whatever\nLanding zone you want in Turkey and Saudi Arabia or whatever just\nGet them out if you have time a secondary mission is to destroy sensitive parts of the embassy or to avoid\nAny sort of embarrassing revelations or whatever but that that really is not your primary mission your primary mission\nIs to get those hostages home because this thing is dragging on and makes America look impotence um and it's an election year and Jimmy Carter wants to be elected so come up with a plan\nPractice the plan a train for the plan equipped for the plant and stand by hopefully we don't need the plan that is your mission you are a general thoughts or or your Charlie Beck with colonel Charlie back with the head of delta force\nDelta force was newly organized\nA special forces operational detachment delta had been put together in the mid and I'm a mid seventies mid late seventies\nTo mimic the British special air service the S. A. S. British SAS\nAre are ah to this day the most legendary special force a organized in World War two and a ... from the fifties sixties to the uh and the ah the embassy raid and Nineteen eighty\nOr to this day the S. A. S. are still considered some of the best special forces on earth while the United States Army want it to mimic ah right down to the organization of the S. A. S. uh that is a ... ... troops in squadrons instead of companies\nIn battalions the rangers are in companies and battalions of the ranger regiment the special forces Green Berets are in operational detachment who are parts of companies or parts of battalions\nBut delta force imitated S. A. S. the British SAS delta force is organized in troops in squadrons\nThere first commander charging Charlie back with actually went through SAS selection and then he actually did a liaison to her and exchange to or where he actually commanded an essay us troop\nFor a for a year or two so he was the ideal guy to organize delta force and organize it's early selection process and the whole thing so\nNineteen Seventy nine these guys had been selected a they'd been trained they had one of the largest small arms budget and the entire US military they were in many cases guys who were not even unconventional enough for special forces\nAre but there were a lot of them it was clear that they were very good uh and that if anybody was going to be handed this mission to uh take the U.S embassy hostages out\nOf it would be delta force but delta force was not a standalone force they had no planes they didn't have vehicles they didn't have submarines they didn't have satellites that they were just a bunch of guys at Fort Bragg North Carolina\nUnder a new thing called so calm special operations command\nSo your mission is get these six feet or so people out of hostile territory a ... enormous city a sprawling city of four to five million\nA over a mile high in the winter in November possibly um and get them out without a gigantic firefight killing hundreds of Iranian civilians and probably resulting in many dozens of of your people's deaths\nUh so that's your mission so what should this look like what is right look like before we get to what happens let's talk about what was

who speaks Farsi\nOr they're dressed in Iranian army uniforms they are supposed to convoy into Tehran\nAnd just look like any other Iranian army convoy which is very common pull up to the U.S embassy and immediately the rangers who were along on the raid around the mission pop out of the tracks the first in the last truck and they set up roadblocks on the main road that goes in front of the\nAh US

twenty fourth and twenty fifth of a Nineteen eighty what has now become to be called the fiasco\nUh so what went wrong\nWith operation eagle clog the aborted attempt to rescue American hostages and the Iranian embassy\nWell from the outset\nForce had been assuming a level of confidence and professionalism with the helicopter crews\nThat they would have received from army helicopter crews um they were told that because the army couldn't move helicopters forward to ah to Oman or to the USS Nimitz that they would go\nFlying a familiar aircraft the are\nThe are eight fifty three which was almost identical to the marine corps ... fifty three that's not a problem\nThe problem was familiarity with a with a local airspace and local weather conditions like the boob the or the sandstorm\nOr as well as familiar with the mission and the problems that might come up with a mission so there was never a dress rehearsal done and that by the way that goes on so come on the Marines assigned the navy\nOr or the army but in all honesty the army was driving this in the army should have insisted on a dress rehearsal\nA at Puerto Rico or on Oman or something like that but there never was a day when all the various moving pieces came together\nThe focus was on what happens when we get to the embassy\nNot how do we get to the embassy the getting to the embassy was assumed to be a fairly easy have light lifting sort of thing well that turned out to be what the ah the Achilles heel the entire mission\nWas that the aircrew both air force and marine pilots in the navy helicopters\nAh we're a had had not ever flown at night\nHadn't flown together at night the marine pilots hadn't used air force ground controllers before a they hadn't attempted refueling like this a with a night vision goggles in a dusty atmosphere a brown out a ... in a low however\nSo they had never uh been able to identify all these contingencies that they could have reached trained and plan for the the actual operation was the first time all this stuff came together so if you'd looked at this on paper and said what could go wrong\nThat should have been your first clue that there was no practice know dress rehearsal no walk through a no no real time war gaming they never even had the commanders together in the same room a to sit there and simulate in real time what was going to happen\nAt desert one what would happen if we were found out by a bus full of Iranians are what will happen if a police car shows up uh what will happen\nOr if a meteorite illuminates the desert none of that was done no war gaming was done it was simply assumed that desert one was going to be the easy part and getting up to deserve to was also going to be the easy part that the heavy lifting was going to be delta force\nAre getting to the embassy and doing all the bang bang so\nWould it have worked had they got to the embassy um uh I I Know it's a very complex plan\nBut I think it would have worked I think it also would have left behind a lot of debt Iranian Revolutionary guards guys but I don't think the world would have a hell of a lot of sympathy for them I think some American hostages\n'em or what have been collateral damage would have been casualties uh as as we know now two of them were ah or unaccounted for who knows what the Iranians would have done to them\nBut uh let's say out of the sixty hostages let's say fifty living Americans were freed by American delta force guys and a on a of the ... on April twenty six we the sun came up and we saw them getting off a plane and see one forty one at ... air force base in Turkey\nUm that would have been a bold bold commando mission or it would have been accomplished we would have been justifiably proud and uh in in who knows ... the crisis would've been over it would have been resolved by a America post Vietnam\nWith a a success in force of arms and who knows maybe Jimmy Carter might have been reelected um I don't think he would have been reelected in Nineteen Seventy nine of course December Seventy nine the Russians invaded Afghanistan\nCarter had already given away the Panama Canal ah I think that on the night of April twenty four and a twenty fifth of Nineteen eighty\nRonald Reagan got elected president of course um he wasn't actually president until next year and then famously on ah the moment that he was inaugurated as president of the United states\nThe Iranians released the American hostages after four hundred and forty four days\nIn captivity or so that is the um the barebones truth of what happened with
