you're\nWe're hearing October fest serrano sausage and special for just a Ninety nine number\nIs good yeah I'm the first one I just won a thousand dollars by KFI maybe your next year or next shot at a thousand dollars on KFI is Monday morning between five oh five five point to\nSpectacular All right let's take a phone call or two Hey Tom welcome to handling the law hello\nHello a bill that question accept\nThe money to the Philippines to my wife five hundred bucks she wants to go pick it up and they said they'd already been picked up but she um picked it up ... is there anything I can\nDo all you can try a you um it was a money order and you've sent it via the mail\nOr no it was it was through Western Union a bang bang pay or online or so I got records you know\nBut in the meantime someone came up obviously with her idea of some kind and grab the money yeah it's a problem you've got to go to Western Union say how do I handled this\nYeah I didn't do him about carrying car\nAnd they're just not and they just they just won't or even responded\nWhile they finally said that it had been picked up properly and yet they haven't showed me any proof of that you know\nRight and you're entitled to who signed for I Would have been picked up\nBecause they're arguing was or is if your wife did pick it up Tom and then says she didn't pick it up a than they\nAre saying the same thing you are a except on the other side of that on the other side of that door you're saying she never picked it up and someone picked it up and they're saying wait a minute you could have picked it up and you simply want five hundred new a new five hundred dollar check\nYeah you gotta mess on your hands uh it it's not easy and the easiest way and I tell you this is a very very good lesson as a does she have a bank account in the Philippines yeah\nWhy don't you why didn't you why didn't you just do a direct deposit do a a electronic transfer\nWell she she hadn't signed up with the bank yeah and we're doing it through Western Union before and it was all work it out\nYeah I Know I understand but it's a the protection or with the labor I ran for ... on the dollar and yeah it's a it's a lesson you off I the way that she does she live in the Philippines\nShe does right now she's come over here in about three months\nYeah ah anyway just start talking to Western Union where's that happens you sue Western Union ah but yeah it's going to be a problem because you know here's what you want to do you want where is the paperwork I've got to see where someone picked up the money you have to have a signature someplace\nWhere someone just can't come in and go Hi I'm ... wife and I want the money\nNo the real careful about\nThat right so there is so they have something on a they have something on file and you want to call them otherwise you sue them otherwise simply sue Western Union for five hundred dollars in court I Would\nYeah I've never done\nThat yeah I Know you see them and you say hey here's what happened they won't provide me any of the paperwork they're saying it was picked up legitimately but I\nThere is no way I can never tell because they won't give me the paperwork judge is going to look at them and go why why don't you have the paperwork why do you have Tom the paperwork ah well ah you know there's going to be and if I'm the judge I'm hanging in five hundred dollars just because they're being\nA bunch of ... right yeah I think that's what I Would do see what a small claims a judge\nDoes and doesn't do All right Audrey you yes ma'am well can I Do for you\nEver heard of that property five years ago that was completely fence surveyed or anything just took it as that but today\nWe had a neighbor by the twenty ... twenty acre people next to us and he is an informed us that we're seeing the over under the poverty line my question is\nI don't know you can make a little bit that he and I have to make this\nMiddle now probably not probably not 'cause it's your fans on his property okay\nAn adverse possession means that you are claiming the property the whole property\nAnd you won't audit and that is and there are all kinds of rules to adverse possession one of them being you pay the taxes on that piece of property which you have it\nYeah so at birth possession doesn't fly here because I don't have to do with ownership the only thing that flies here is Kenny make you move the fence it's on his property yes now you can argue if it's been there long enough\nThat you have some kind of ease meant that a bar it's constructive ease meant to keep that fence but you know I got to tell you I think you have to move the fence but I Would argue tell them you know I'm willing to move it just pay for half of it you didn't know I didn't know and what kind of fences it\nAt the chain link fence a big I mean come on big deal just uh yeah you go to him and go let let's split the stand and if he says no you don't\nOkay how about this one I'm not\nMoving the fence down ah so you get to take the fence down at your expense or you get to sue me to take the ... and let's start talking about what it's going to cost you to sue me versus splitting the cost of moving a chain link fence\nOkay and don't worry about it kind of come back at us like in five years they get mad at the middle of it\nIs harder and harder for him to do it but to leave it alone if he does not says he says don't worry about it the longer you have it without moving or the stronger your argument\nIs for keeping the fence there and you have a constructive these miners something the fences to use for his use of his land the extra sixteen feet that you get to use that he doesn't\nCorrect that's wrong issue here in that use the ease meant that you're talking about he still owns it\nBut you can argue since it was fenced he allowed it to be ... and he keeps on going on as long as he says don't worry about it you don't worry about it\nAnd as soon as I said as soon as he says moving ago it was what let's see what happens that's what I Would do and if I were the uh the owner of the property I Would do it in a heartbeat\nThis is handling the law lets

broadcasting live from the great Pacific Air show right until eleven thirty handle on the law until ten then Bryan Suits an eye for another hour and a half talking everything air show\nHey Bob welcome to handle on along\nYeah yeah I was arrested and went to jail and um my girlfriend at the time had a friend who bailed me out I did not have insurance then 'cause I didn't have that money to do it\nBut I was bailed out by them by him actually um I didn't have the money to pay it back a week later when we met the bail bond when I signed papers for him just a bail bondsman no that yes I who I Am and blah blah blah [laughter]\nAnyways uh the guy who bailed me out is suing claims court and I don't know what kind of gave out however many urgent I'd never signed and they pay for everything\nI Know how much how much how much money did die he uh pay for the bail\nTwenty five hundred\nRight so offensively what you're saying is I never signed any papers I shouldn't have to pay\n[noise] well I didn't say that I told them at some point I Would try and write and\nIt's been a while and I it was the upshot to go but anyway so I always tell me so I'm like well I don't know what you know\nOr whatever you know you're going to go to court and your defense is is we have no agreement and I told them I Would\nPay him back when I could and as a matter of fact when he painted we never had an agreement at all there's no sign contracts\nSo the argument you can make is this a friend of yours I use it without\nMy ex girlfriends I mean I knew who\nHe was ... when then you're arguing defense is is that he did it for the benefit of his girlfriend\nAnd ah that's that's gonna be your defense whether the judge buys it or not I have no idea\nOccupying Iraq if I'm the judge I'm going to set up some kind of a payment schedule however uh technically I mean he's going to sue you and he wants the money now and you don't have it\nIs the judge gonna grab him a a a judgment maybe who knows what the judge is going to do in small claims court but do you have some of his defense is saying hey I thought it was a gift he never said anything ever asked to be paid back my girl friends said I have a range\nFor bail demean made where you are and are there you go\nAnd as far as you're concerned it was a favorite of her she's the one that put it up because uh of a relationship you once had there was any number of defenses but what you have to do is go to court and what you have to do is defend yourself and say number one no agreement ever odd\nVaries ... there was never worried about me paying it back\nI had always assumed I had always assumed that this was given to me because of my relationship with the ex girlfriend okay it was a\nGeneral again obviously I Wonder if I don't do I go to jail\nOr no no you don't go to jail there'll be a judgment against you that's all\nHe collected I\nMean that's existed there you go that's exactly the point if you have no money\nAnd they have no assets or he can't collect it\nI mean and what are you gonna do you're right is that it can you go to jail of course you can throw you in jail debtors prison you know when debtors prison went out just about I think in the Seventeen hundreds is when they got rid of better times in the United states\n[laughter] All right All right so uh those are the defenses I mean it's really easy get your window I often say get it in writing get it in writing get it in writing\nHello Bob welcome to handle on law\n[noise] yes hello yes go ahead\nYes I I I was involved in an accident automobile accident and I met her claim or to the other parties insurance company\nAnd that has more to want to go and they are still investigating yeah ... is there any statute of limitations\nYeah there is you're yeah there is

dollars just to see a\nGuy not sure what the company didn't hit you\nYes okay so so I I I actually was a guy\nYeah yeah you assume and then and then the insurance company may jump in uh because uh that's what he pays for his insurance and they can sit there and go we're investigating were investigating two months of investigation has kind of a long time so what I Would do is write to him\nAnd for say hey listen get the insurance company involved in this I mean a lot quicker than it is otherwise I'm simply going to sue you in small claims court in all collect out I'll just go after you

hurt in the process of doing now but they want to use used parts instead of a\nOh no no no you can say not a chance\nOr not it's not a chance I Want\nReal parts that\nAre part of I Want real word parts now we get bigger junkyard\nNow read your insurance while they can't do that I mean that's crazy you simply say no and you sue them for the repair you sue the insurance company and say I want this being repaired and here's what it's going to cost and if you want to go to a junk yard that's ... they want to go to a junk yard repair it\nThey already were rampart junkyard well check to me then they send it to the\nI wouldn't accept it but I wouldn't I wouldn't accept in or I Would sue them for a if you can figure out the difference but ah I simply wouldn't expect to accept that at all\nYou know when they finished ... ...\n... or you have to sign a document that say you expected as is that's the problem but if you don't fixate based on the fact you want a new repair and you go out and rent a car that's part of your damages a so already\nProviding my daughter at Carter Greg\nWell uh yeah and but they're not going to ah keep on paying for it so your daughter key player I mean there's all\nThe courage she can keep it earlier she picks her car up she got to take it back then\nUh yeah unless you pick them for cars yet taken back but you don't read your policy read your insurance policy because if it says that they're able to use\nIf they're able to use ... after more than a partial to keep in mind in a junk yard you may be able to get a brand new part\nAn original four part just because it's in a junk yard doesn't matter where Iran right now because you have to look at that as a matter of fact you're probably better off getting an original Ford part from a junk yard than you are with an after market\nFor it you let's say a car has been rear ended right and it's only been around for a year what let's say we pulled carburetor out is brand new\nRight now I'm not arguing that that is legit but I Would have a mechanic look at it and if it's just as good ... what do you want to do I mean how much of an argument you want to get into you basically got a sort of kind of with no damage\nOr he my insurance to stay sick or what I call them but the other one that robbers were farmers\nYeah it doesn't matter doesn't matter what your insurance is doesn't matter what their insurance is you're talking about what you\nWant me on your ... you're screwed\nYou know if they're not going to jump in you've got an issue going with the insurance company that's paying for the cars that simple and again you know yeah they shouldn't yeah but what are your actual damages you know are you telling me\nBryan hello Brian welcome oh yeah yeah I\nMy wife uh\nEleven years ago was convicted of possession charge in the county of Los Angeles or for that not a single charge less traffic tickets subsequent to that wonderful wife wonderful mother she's gone back to school\nAnd she's getting her ... um the charges in the process of being expunged however the California state nursing board as a robot buster yeah I'm sure any type of drug convictions and curious if you have any opinion as to what type of an attorney and we certainly are going to need representation\nI don't know for the California bar yeah and I don't\nKnow if you do 'cause your argument is going to be it's been this long look what's happened what is an attorney going to say\nThat you wouldn't say on your own\n... very true ah our biggest concern is just subsequent to investigation I've done on my own the California board it literally decides you know the cases on what side of the bed they woke up on and\nThe more you know I Believe that if I was leaving so if you want to make yeah right okay we stop\nThe eyes crossed already than do everything just right so they don't come back and denied license or give a conditional license or anything\nLike that and they made a name and jobs and they may be anyway doing it\nBut if you're talking about one or two when what attorney would you go to to make sure 'cause you're more comfortable going to an attorney\nIt would be a anybody that
