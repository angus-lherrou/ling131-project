welcome to Jesus Christ show oh I think that's what's going on to see\nHow people in my church I'm really round all the congregation that church with restructuring pastors in ... and now some of those doors are returning back to the church from my question is how do I have fellowship with football I I\nCan't forget them as I'm called to do that I don't trust them and I feel so protective of my church\nOK rightly so I'm ... they're running your church in in what way um you want to give names and super specifics but\nThat the pastor was just not to put it in a way it should have been okay and um it was found to be that they they really did wrong\nAnd that we had we had to restructure because people are willing to step down to the the church and to keep the congregation I'm\nOK so this was a big deal it's changed the ... the entire structure of the church was changed\nWas horrible and the people that had the problem\nOr they\nThey created their own church OK and many of them left that and now it's kind of cutting back there for almost two years for this okay so there's a lot of it that it's still there and still feel that\nOkay but the but this is the beauty of of this type of relationship if people can make mistakes I guarantee if you look down on the pencils in your house street they have a research as well right um everybody's going to make mistakes\nThe the purpose of the body of Christ is not to this is you know there's\nYou've got the reformation and you've got this split of the church and you've got to know Catholics and Protestants and they butt heads on occasion and then the Protestant started making little factions of Protestantism and they've got groups here in groups there now they start butting heads and it continues to go on and it's the most frustrating part\nA of Christianity\nWhen you were you looking at it so the purpose of it all is for you to all remain tied to the essentials\nAnd those essential sorry who do you say that I Am a my mother the trinity all of these things the resurrection these are the essential or the ... the rest is peripheral garbage it's\nJust stuff it's stuff that the that that you're gonna have to get through it's like in a marriage or any relationship um the essential are important that you love and that you trust each other and that you uh are focused on the same purpose of happiness and a gross\nSo in the church you have to be single minded in those things about God not just the church\nAnd if somebody makes a mistake and there's a huge division in our wounds and there are scars and then they come back you have to at least allow that you're going to take place you have to\nCome to effort to the church and ask for forgiveness or have been for it and acknowledge good with it but I'm asking about those who are not\nWell then you confront them and that's like ... absolutely\nYou up to them and say listen but you put it on you not that it's not about them this is about you wanting to heal through it um and don't put it like they're doing well you said listen I I'm having a real issue with this and we were here and we stood here and don't feel that you're better than them cause you stood\nBecause everybody will make a mistake but it's that you're there and you had to watch it and in your pain to buy it\nAnd and it's talk that out with them and so you feel like\nYou know the church needs an apology or something like that but talk it out to be brothers and sisters in his face and and not be pushing against each other so much or that the division that happened before could have been the logical now it's emotional and political get over that move forward\nI appreciate you taking the time to listen to the show every single Sunday right here I tell

into the\nFans or Los Angeles chargers and argue the university are warning to ten thousand dollar college scholarships to help active\nDuty or veteran members of the military achieved their educational goals nominate yourself or nominate someone you know applications\nOkay now this was right before friday morning them what did they tell you to do to get ready for the flight\nOut for the most part hydration that was all that was all they said that was it don't you know don't need a big breakfast but don't skip the meal you know a usually being without food will cause a sensation\nThat you feel like you're hungry but you're actually going to route or vice versa you feel like you're going to Ralph when all yours just hunger so what did you have for breakfast a friday morning I had a\nI think it was like a hard boiled egg in an English muffin or something like that I had a big meal the night before big dinner on Thursday night so it wasn't I didn't feel hungry at all and mature I was drinking water and and uh they tell me as soon as you meet with a pilot you're about an hour away\nWheels up so once you meet with the pilot had that last global water and then you're going to want to go to the bathroom and then you're going to want to go to the bathroom again right squeeze it all out is what they said because you do not want to have to be in the back of an F. sixteen that's bad that's a bad scene for everybody\nThat's an embarrassing and that if something happens in the back seat of an ethics yeah what do they do who's who's in charge me in an eye on your left I act\nI asked that question I talked to a major filter on Wednesday on our show\nAnd I said just listen I don't plan on it I don't I don't anticipate there being any sort of bodily issues but if there was do you guys have a maintenance team who's in charge of clean up and he said oh you very much you we will come out there with a bottle of four o nine and a roller paper towels and you're cleaning it up\nSo fortunately you didn't have to add that to your video didn't have to put that on my video\nOr and they're very I mean they were very nice everybody knows the people's bodies react differently to different things and I'm sure they've seen just about everything [laughter] ... you know that are all of that plane so uh what's\nThe rumor about do they intentionally or are they are they going to try to make you throw up\nWell there is and I mentioned before that my father in law is a blue angel\nAnd I did not disclose that information to them until after the flight hell and it has as I did I Would have been an issue they've had a rivalry for decades and it's in all its good natured rivalry and they think they're better and they think they're better but but they will\nI didn't want to be the guy caught in the middle of that rivalry my poor body would not be able to take whatever thing they were going to dish out to prove their their dominant\nSo they weren't they weren't approaching you aggressively no in fact that you don't want to poke them well\nYes I Would say that they they say listen they don't want it to be a story about me ... in the back seat of an F. sixteen that's not what it's about\nAnd they know that my story is better if I don't have to include that part in the video right so so that was it and they and they all along they said this whole thing so the uh the public affairs officer explains what's going on and then I meet with the equipment guys\nThe equipment guys fit me they've already gotten my measurements and everything I had to do a full physical with my own doctor and he had to sign off that it was everything was okay\nSo they have a flight suit ready for me and that's what you see in the videos the flight suit that I'm wearing this probably been warned by two dozen other people\nLaundered in between of course but hopefully hopefully and then they do a very nice um um informal but sort of a ceremonial delivery of the patches\nSo the patches that you see on the on the flight suit or all temporary their own with Velcro but if ... patch on the shoulder the Thunderbird media patch on the left a chest\nThe fifty seven fighter squadron on the right chess and and you know another patch on that so it was a anyways explaining to me the guy who's putting them on these explain what each of these means and why they take such pride in what they're doing\nWe get those on I get the boots on I sit down and you know we go through the helmet and making sure that the home is going to fit me right how to use the different pieces of the helmet how to unhook the oxygen mask that sort of thing we plug it into a little test nation to make sure that all the avionics worked at my intercom works and that sort of the oxygen works and it all checks out\nSit down with another guy who tells me what to do uh to go through what he called my descent checklist\nAnd and I'm not talking about coming in for a landing checklist it's the under the canopy I've ejected from the airplane I'm under a parachute\nThat dissent check ah which is a little clenching if you think about it that that's the part that makes you go you know what there is a possibility that that this thing goes south very quickly that's\nWhen they told you that that the only way they could get a second seat in the sixteen as much as you\nWell the Paris thankfully the parachute is actually built into the head rest so when you sit in there and you clip in one of the things that they do the buckles that you can see in the video that are closest to my classical that's the parachute everything else is attached to the harness and that that harness attached to the parachute and that's where it attaches with those two buckled so\nAh we went through this whole checklist a and he says listen\nOr you get nervous well at at ... how are you doing I I don't mind at that point I Know the face you're putting on no no I I'm fight at that point but I started\nThinking why am I even listening to this if I have to inject out of an F. sixteen\nNot thinking about I'm not going to remember any of my checklist I you know and that's why he was making it super simple he says listen ... just top to bottom you're going to look up and you're going to see your canopy and make sure that the thing opens up well if it doesn't you can shake the lungs and try to get your parachutes I was like yeah I've done that a million times [laughter]\n[laughter] but he had that's the thing is he had jumped out he has made punk plenty of jumps and said it's a lot easier than you think\nYou don't want to goose this from top gun to his actual cannot be not the parents you can write you know he hit the cannon right that well isn't it that's it landed in the ocean that's\nAn issue they and they they described each one of 'em there's there's a special release it for some reason the canopy doesn't blow when it should\nUh the best thing you could do is just lean your head back you know so it's a against the seat\nAnd then Powell hopefully the helm ... protects you as you go through the canopy or it's just ... but the checklist was you know simple just makes you can't if he's good makes sure how much good and you know lifted the visor they say 'cause that big visors just a giant sunglasses basically\nLift that up so that it improves your vision and then check and make sure that you've got you know that you're still buckled in your heart is still tight and everything there's a couple of things that are attached to the bottom of your chair\nSafety kids' safety box you wanna you wanna loose in that so that it drops below you sort of hanging below you in the ... behind your legs and then just get ready for your for your touchdown\nInstead of just getting ready to feel what what they write hundred and fifty mile an hour wind feels\nLike well it'll slow you down pretty quickly that drag chute ... he said we'll that's the biggest issue I think coming out is is the force of leaving the plane and then big buffet by three hundred and fifty mile an hour winds being jerks to stop by the parachute\nAll of this happens in seconds the seat falls away from you the parachute opens you get pulled out and you know then you're dangling underneath\nSo just to see fall away after the shooters opened\nThe they're the first shoe there's two actually the first shoot will pull you know ... ... as you get out of the airplane\nIt slows you down a pulls you away and oriented you to make sure that if you were upside down sideways or whatever that first shoot actually pulls you to the position you should be which is the way you left the plane facing forward on the seat it gets you oriented\nSoon as it gets enough energy it pulls the it pulls the seat away from you okay and then the main issue comes out from that after that\nAnd then you add all I'm asking you these questions as if somehow I I Need to know that\nSome day I might never know ... you know so then if I put my left to buckle up so we go through this entire\nSafety briefing he says listen you're going to be out in the desert but believe me you won't need to safety can't you won't need the survival kit that is under you because if ... if you would jak out of an F. sixteen in the Mojave Desert\nWe're going to know there's plenty of people around don't worry even though in the video it looks like we're in the middle of nowhere he said you know we had to touch a we had to get permission from Edwards as we flew past Edwards Air force base they know we're there he said you're not going to be out there for very long by yourself ... ...\nSoldiers just to just a touchdown and then you know try and start a fire and direct a temporary shelter and knowing that everybody's going to be there in like Fifteen minutes\nOh you guys I Know you guys were coming I Would have put some coffee on for you or something I'm so we go through this with that part of it and I'm thinking to myself I don't need to I don't need to know this because it's not going to happen\nRight but if it does you know the case here says you know what we're going to add a little something to this demonstration is let's just get in tomorrow\nOr so from their meet with a flight surgeon flight surgeon was a great guy who said listen we're not out here to make ... we're not out here to do anything that's going to upset you we want to put on a good face and we want you to talk well about the air force so\nAll and all the union for combat yeah no you're in a dog following to draw a line just follow the smoke lying to my plane\nSo okay so demonized around here at the great Pacific Air show in Huntington Beach day things are going to kick off in the air right along the beach in a couple of hours\nAnd we do have a couple of things that we wanted to get to and including some of the other stuff that's going on today that ... one ten pilot Aaron bender had an opportunity to ah to interview Jeff bearer boon\nHave you seen this plane but yeah it's incredible so we're playing first time I glance at it I thought oh this is like reminds me of like a pie thirty eight lightning because it's a it's got to use long used to watch but when you actually look at it you're like wait this is weird\nBecause like the thirty eight has to fuselage than in the cockpit isn't middle right ended in the middle across the front wing\nBut this is actually to it looks like somebody's just taken to regular planes and put them together yeah there were two props each fuselage has a prop but then there's a jet engine in the middle of weird playing\nThis is somebody should have taken away his license you should not build a plane like this is a Frankenstein lane alright well also do not we'll be right back we're going to talk about this we're going to listen to ah to vendors interview with Jeff barebones from uh the the pilot of that ... one ten you're going to see a little bit later here in the great Pacific Air show in Huntington Beach\nJeff bourbon is joining me he is part of this weekend's air show the Pacific air show in Huntington Beach Jeff how are you\nI'm doing fantastic super excited about this week and looks like the weather's going to be perfect and of course the crowd is going to be very excited to see this one of a kayak one ten\nOkay yeah see Jeff I'm going to have to stop you read their buddy I've gotten a note here to talk about a young one open the heck is it ... one ten\nWell we had a a five that I've heard is back in\nTwo thousand for the er which is the red or playing the blues are playing with the first yeah fifty five Arab or flu and I had this idea of having attorneys to airplanes into one so I picked the fifty five and the activity five and we call that he got one ten after we\nDeveloped a center effects and that brought these two airplanes together now I've quiet on the left side of the airplane and it just one airplane so we basically taken to\nPull a uh Arab addict\nOr Russia airplanes single ... single engine are playing and now we've combined two of them together with a common cetera section and if that wasn't enough we've added a CJ extend\nLear Jet engine jet engine to the center section for an additional three thousand pounds of ...\nSo the train that three engines I have approximately six thousand pounds at brought them in an airplane with me and it ready to go weighs about four thousand eight hundred pounds you do that that's much better than one the one I'll be out there over hunting and beaches weekend covering their plan about Fifteen hundred feet I pull up right above shows center\nAnd stop the airplane Fifteen hundred feet up\nA bottle the jet back to get up to stop all the way and I'm from a a dead stop I Will push all POWER UP and crime\nA wreck from uh the hub or show center this week and it's going to be also\nWe've not meant I don't know what kind of people you have around you but I'm guessing nobody likes to tell you know\n[laughter] yes that's correct [laughter] well you know we have um a really cool airplane here that says never been done in the history of aviation so you're talking about innovative and one of a kind I mean that's truly\nIs never in in the history of aviation has somebody take him to separate aircraft put them together and then added a jet engine on it so um they the\nThe thing comes together with a lot of people you can imagine that it wasn't just me I I had an idea about this thing I'm a long time ago ... coming up on ten years ago now and um after I met this guy do color\nA um the master builder behind this airplane and and I started strategizing how this thing would look because he had a similar idea a long time ago\nUm so we started putting together a artist rendering except this airplane and what we thought it would look like and we got a a engineer involved at his arm and we got him involved too you know really say yes it will work or it won't and he said\nAbsolutely the thing that's going to be perfect so that that started in the long road to eventually getting um our third party are involved in that Chad ... T he used to own the blue airplane good friend of mine for a long time\nAnd uh so it it made sense for for the three of us to get involved with this since we're both\nAre all three of us had experience with a boat these airplanes and so this was a man is two years ago almost to the day we're going to be October twenty four two thousand sixteen was the day that we brought those two airplanes together\nI'm In this attempt to make them into one airplane and the only just over twelve months after that that we lose airplane not what the that ended up with the tour planes combined it was less than Thirteen months in build process so uh that's tribute to\nAh the master mechanic the adult color and then um after another couple of months we've got the jet engine and sold and we did our first or show it May of this year two thousand Eighteen so uh Huntington Beach will be our our uh their show\nOf the season and it's been going\n... better than could ever imagine the or the crowds have been really a receptive and airplanes going really well received ... gosh this year and it was a I Would because I'm a little biased I Would say it's the most\nUh anticipated airplane or at Oshkosh this year so um we really have something here it is that they can and very excited this weekend to be out there over a Huntington Beach or it's going to be fantastic\nI Would imagine people looking at the program come across a lot of the things that recognizes until they get to your ... won ten\nWell that's right I mean there's a fantastic ran up this weekend you have\nA bill Stein and um [noise] not Chapman a among other about it and of course you have the highlight there the U.S airports thunderbirds\nA but all those things to be honest I mean they've seen though I mean they've seen the jak team there than they are about proteins um they've seen the you know the single engine you know flip flop as we call them a lot of times\nAnd uh when they say this airplane there it's going to be a no doubt that wait a second we have something extremely different here\nOr are those two airplanes together where the jet sound coming from that's what we kinda get a initial reactions\nAre kind of looks like a war bird like a pie thirty eight but it's not it has a ... but it has a jet sound um and it looks like to airplanes fly and very very close together and tell you you know really realized when I pull up like I said before when you pull up that shows that are just covering their plane there\nIt's quite apparent that um we definitely got something different\nBourbon is the pilot of the ... one\nIn a couple of years ago you were at the great Pacific Air show in Huntington Beach flying the screaming sasquatch\nThat's correct or you know I Am pretty familiar with are putting two different types of uh the engines on an airplane and find them and\nAnd uh we did have that opportunity and with the the jak links jet Walker and junk later showed their Huntington Beach a couple of years ago wasn't amazing airplane that is a also one of the kind a airplane\nI'm with a better than one to one power to weight ratio those on the beach a couple of years ago so that airplane hovering out or over the\nOver the beach aired and climbing out of a zero air speed configuration so yes there are a separate Saturday to bring something even that much more different ... if you can even imagine it was possible but the uh the cool thing with this airplane as that we have\nThree engines and two of them are upset from the center of gravity so it gives me this opportunity differential truck\nSo you'll save me up there at the top of a maneuver and then I'll pole let's that pose a last ditch and all the way back to do with the right at all at full power an airplane just spins around and really a path they in a horizontal plain or if I'm On a vertical wind I can do the same thing and it just kinda pin wheels around\nUm with the differential power a capability that I have so and and being at just start first year with the airplane I'm barely just scratching the surface on all the\nReinvented maneuvers that were going to be able to do at this point\nYou've got a couple of years ago one of the ... airplane now one of my one of the ... airplane is it because in your day job you fly an airplane that looks like a lot of other airplanes\nI I Do fly into airline or on a regular basis [laughter] so yeah that's a pretty normal a type of flying but you know for me it's a matter of I Want to fly every airplane so I've flown today almost two hundred different types of aircraft\nAnd to get these up chairs the party is one of the ... airplane uh is is really a kind of Catholic like Jimmy Franken was a hero of mine since I've been a little kid that watch and give it right but and he was the uh innovator of the very first jet walk out so the jak links get Walker um the second rendition\nA of that are playing and yeah so I always looked up to a gym at Franklin for having such a an incredible idea and so unique and\nAnd now we're we're in that same boat you know I I mean if you would have told me Twenty years ago that I Would find a jet Walker like Jimmy Franklin did I would've said there's no no chance I mean what are you talking about that's crazy and there was when I was at ... I'm a jet Walker and now we've\nIn our flight soon as we get to a we take off you were Thirteen thousand feet in a matter of seconds\nWe turn towards Mojave Desert and we just bomb straight out their straight line he's telling everybody look out for me I'm big red white and blue airplane or little I guess compared to the other planes in the sky butter were flying out there we're going to keep a maintain a one air speed were due to three fifty not we're going to do Thirteen thousand five hundred feet\nAnd we're going to keep it there until we get to the place we need to get through\nAnd um it's just an opportunity for us to kind of get you on for me to get used to the airplane feel what it feels like completely smooth ... move this flight ever even though it was pretty windy I mean it was windy because there were red flag conditions on friday didn't feel it at Thirteen thousand feet and didn't feel it at three hundred and fifty\n... that's the point is is the host mood with wind is just a little breeze yes it doesn't even count when you're that aerodynamic I always wanted to know how legit the cockpit or whether they gave you a stick but it wasn't actually conducted anything they're like air to air it looked like it came off an Atari twenty yards now know it used\nTo do and you'll it's everything in there was real often my left is the throttle and every once in a while I could see out of the corner of my eyes especially when we went supersonic you'd see that things start to move its all fly by wire so it moves just like you know his is moving\nUm same with the stick now the stick is different this is not you know when you imagine\nA an old fighter jet you're thinking of a you know three foot long pole with a handle on the end of it ... and that's how you're moving that plane around that's not what it is anymore it's just imagine I'm a joystick on your computer that's all it is right and it does it move more than about a quarter of an inch at any one direction\nSo it's all pressure sensitive so you could put your hand on that sick and you know jam that thing as far to the left and quickly as you want\nIt's only going to respond you know tactile pack delete it's only going to go about a quarter of an inch when you're going to do a full role on that airplane so one of the first things we do is uh we get and you were in the air were flying out over the mountains and I were doing F. O. D. or we're doing a check for ... for an object to break\nThat airplane\nAnd the tarmac that it's on have to be spotless rocks screws toenails everything has to be picked up and clean because the giant air intake underneath that thing that's going to bring the air and for the engine is very sensitive piece of equipment so they don't want anything getting scooped up in their toothbrush changed anything\nBecause that'll ruin the airplane when you're inside the aircraft as well they don't want any loose stuff flying around the cockpit\n... how did how did they take off in a you know in the middle of the desert then if if the winds are gusting and blowing sand across the tarmac but I don't know very carefully they wait till the we have to wait until the sand wow okay a but All right but you're already up in New York so we're in the air is F O D s R D\nHere's what you do you just look around the cabin you look around the cabin the cockpit you look and see if there's anything that's that's you know there that shouldn't be there should be all strapped down or nailed down screwed down\nYour seat is ... and was folded up\nCocktail service has already come and gone to make sure you throw your trash away and you're just looking for screws are washers or you know stop a wedding ring\nMake sure everything is zipped up tied down whatever it needs that's the hard way to do for an object of reject the easy way as when he inserts the airplane and everything that\nSlows a chain called top of the canopy and actually in that video that I saw you can see there is some and I'm reaching up and I'm trying to pinch all it was a little shred of plastic or something wasn't going to be a big deal but I'm up there trying to pinch if they've all were hanging upside down trend that that's what you were doing yes I I'm like what are you you're just fascinated with the\nNew your upside down so you were just trying to touch the desert floor there was some stuff in there and I have a\nGlove on and I'm trying to grab it um but I and then I stupidly UCI grab it and then I put it down like I'm going to put it on my feet or something and\nYou're still upside down yet not smart or wasn't picking a tireless so we get out there you see beautiful view of either way I appreciate you giving me this\nWhat F O D foreign object to breathe yeah yeah because I borrowed my son's truck yesterday and he found a lot of effort into a make a run to pick up some pipe and uh yeah [laughter] ever get into somebody's car\nAnd you're like what I have a teenage daughter heck yeah I've been going on here there's a family of squirrels living in there or something yeah this\nThis this truck was not flight rated [laughter] going to say if we had turned upside down at any time a there would have been pound of F O D you get and you can't you can't get rid of that you know All right um\nSo we move out into the desert we go out way past Edwards Air force base which by the way is unbelievable from the air incredible view of the extended runways that sort of go out in that dry lake bed that I've\nNever seen that crazy test flight runways I mean just ... their stuff all over the place and they're bigger than you can imagine so we get way past that we didn't realize that the shuttle can land exactly yeah I'm On long runways\nSo we get north of bad words or were in the middle of nothing or just scrubbing dirt and that's about it um and we started doing just a couple of maneuvers and some of them are just some some tight turns nothing crazy just to get used to what's going to feel like when those air bladders you know fill up how I'm going to time my breathing and that sort of thing\nHe in the front seat is doing exactly the same thing major branded Volcker was doing exactly the same thing I was doing in terms of the same breathing granted he's much more used to it so he can time it a lot better\nUm but I could key off of him I could hear him in the intercom breathing and doing that breathing that hook maneuver the fifth hits him I Can't see them you can write here but I can hear him doing it so I can do might be more days on\nHim this isn't just rookie stuff this is the real stuff this is it like this no this is what we all do yes\nOkay yeah and it's not something you get used to the you know that you get used to counteracting the effects of the gravitational forces on you but you you can't condition yourself to handle an nine gee turn he's doing the same thing that I'm\nDoing it or not like it well I've been doing this for ten years I'm used to I don't read anymore\nSo we do a couple of those very quick you know turn just to get used to it get through the timing and everything and we do a role just unable to run role which is where you're you know pointed at the horizon the nose the plane never changes and you just roll on the axis it was one time around you and then he says okay your turn ... so I say\nWell meaning meaning I'm going to do the same maneuver I'm Sorry I just went through that ... yeah [laughter] I took my nephew did a great job I I Can't do better than that\nAnd he says no grab the stick and do a turn just jammed that saying to the left\nAnd I said okay oh I Am a taxpayer I guess I paid for part about it might as well read that stick and jam and you could see in the video might turn is faster than his only because I have no idea what I'm doing because he said jama 'til yeah and I did I was what's the worst that can happen\nWings fly right [laughter] I didn't mean that [laughter] so I jammed that sticks a laugh we do a complete turn I I almost brought it back to the level of I stopped a little short of it and then I had to pull the nose up a little bit 'cause whenever you're doing sort of an Arab addict maneuver you're going to lose some air speed and you're going to lose some of that the\nSome of the pitch that you want to keep trying to pull the nose up a little bit and I was satisfied at that point that I had flown or an F. sixteen\nSo that was that was quick early introduction was was that the highlight\nI don't know if it was the highlight but it is definitely one of the cool things I got to go home and tell my kids you actually did when I'm sixty but you didn't bring it all the way around didn't bring it all the way around it I left it a little short unfortunately fight another chance I'd probably go too far I'd over correct and I'd I'd end up with a you know six point turn or something\nSo we do a couple of maneuvers there are some of the very basic things ... a barrel roll which is a very gradual ah over a turn that's the same kind of a thing where it's not it's not on the planes access it's not played it acts as you grow up and around\nUm and when you leave the smoke trail behind it you leave what looks like a big corkscrew corkscrew much larger than it would if it was just the ... sure\nDo a couple of overturns couple of more roles we do a very low gee gradual loop\nOr which was pretty cool because you're I mean you get so high and I think probably we started low maybe four thousand feet probably topped out at about twelve thousand feet came back around and then on that same before we even had a chance to breed\nDid that same loop but a much tighter loop where we didn't go as high and that's I mean you could see in the video\nYou can see the cabin patient on the wings you could see sort of the the vapor barrier vapors begin to form on the wing because you're getting\nA ... year and a half sixteenth getting through the air at that point much tighter much higher jeeze probably five or six jeeze at that point pull out of that then we get into um\nSome of the ah the more exotic things where you go down low once again and then point the plane directly\nIn the sky Ninety degrees and from the ground straight up into the air and do three halo Ron roles so again ... ... as you're going straight up\nIt's more disorienting in the video then it was in the airplane because once you get straight up perfectly blue clear skies you can't see a thing and there's no reference point to even tell you that you're spinning\nSo you're feeling jeeze back against your chest at the beginning yes beginning yeah and then you catch up with that and and your climb\nThat the pilots signed wrote nine jeeze on the side so I can tell everybody so at the end of all of this you know you mentioned this at the very beginning at the end of all of this\nAnd the pilots as I said I have to get out there he's the one who narrates the show and he'll be out here later to narrate their portion of the of the demonstrations later on major failure he says I have to go I got to get up to the beach or because I have to get ready for the practice in the demonstration for later on\nAnd they do a briefing out here so I said hey nice to meet you and thanks for being my driver today appreciate it I have a story to tell you a little secrets to we mean you there we go and he leans in and I said um my father in law\nMy father in law flew for the blue angels and he gets a big grin on his face and he says oh I see I said no listen\nYou made my Thanksgiving dinner that much more exciting\nBut I didn't want to tell you beforehand because I don't need to get caught up in the rivalry and he laughed throws his head back and laughs and says okay I get it no problem you have a good relationship with your father in law yeah yeah I'm his idea though [laughter] idea for me\nWas to walk in on friday morning with the blue angel helmet under my arm and said oh I got my own home that I find with this or that did not happen no because I did not need to ah to live out\nThe friendly but very serious rivalry that\nThey have this Thanksgiving at the dinner table yes as your father in law goes on one of his blue angel stores right are you going to be like well you know what let me interrupt you just a second\nI'm not sure I see it that way [laughter]\nHaving spent some time in the air myself\nWell uh it is it is funny because people now ask me stuff about the speed you know and an aircraft and\nFriend of mine is a commercial pilot and he came over on friday night and we had a beer and sat there and watch the video from beginning to end and he was full of questions full of questions about what and I just tell them listen everybody knows the capabilities of an F. sixteens uh\nAnd uh so you write a but it was a phone conversation so it will be great I don't know if my father in law's ever pulled nine geez I assume so but I Am going to ask him because on the off chance that he hasn't\nYou know I don't know whether you have for that's what they flew when he was flying with the blue angels was enough for I don't know the capabilities that plan I don't know if it was supersonic or not or how often he would be supersonic but ah\nIt's gonna be fun it'll be it'll be a good time at the teams are amazing now they are now they're plaintiff eighteens yes but at the time they in eighty eighty one they were flying a force\nRight so but it's just an absolute\n... time now you can you can hire these guys for kids birthday parties right well\nI guess you could if you are but you have money in this morning well they do have they do have a price a card they have a very late scale in the in there a support manual that you can find online\nThere's a lot more that goes into it you have you do have to have you have to supply them with the right sort of air fields you have to make sure that you have security for the planes et cetera twenty four hours a day they demand access to a gymnasium between six in the morning and ten o'clock at night\nConstantly and it's clear that they use it wow 'cause there was not an ounce of body fat on any one of those guys were gals\nThat is amazing well we just listening to Gary Hoffman's F. sixteen right along experience on friday morning and then in the air show\nAnd then in the fight it yeah on the show yeah it was a blast that's amazing\nUm the video of all of it the whole thing I edited down to about five minutes long you can see all of the different aerial maneuvers again the one thing I left that was going supersonic because\nSome that camera in the back of the airplane you don't see it looking up very soon as it up on your Instagram it's on the Gary and she entered Instagram it's on Facebook it's on Twitter We're gonna throw it to make sure we have it up on the website as well\nNow there are captions on the video explaining the maneuvers that you're doing what about the audio the audio is not in there yet not yet we're ... we we still have all of the audio the what's funny is oh so you you did capture the audio somewhere somewhere\nSomewhere the air force has it and the government is going through whatever a top secret security clearance they need before they can release it I don't know what that means but they they didn't give me the right audio but I Do have Alex Michael Sims audio the TV reporter he flew on Thursday and he was whining about\nFeeling sick I just think that you're going to use it as a black male again I think your video that's already up on Instagram without your audio yes he's a great opportunity for fans and listeners of the show to add the load the video\nTheir own Gary Hoffman audio track\nTo it and then send it back I let's see what how I did think that I can give us potentially going to add my own voice over pretending that it was the actual a cockpit audio should do a voice overs [laughter] one one where you were paralyzed and fears yes the other when where you were like Joe cruel\nJoke cool joke rule I could do that both I could absolutely do that All right\nSo we're out here for the great Pacific Air show in Huntington Beach ... beautiful day things are going to get started again it is I thought there were clouds coming in but it's a definitely looks like it has broken up quite a bit so it's going to be absolutely beautiful opportunity\nTo watch these great airplanes a little bit later I'm and we're going to actually broadcast the the\nThe PA so that as you're out here you can hear what's going on I'm not that you wouldn't be able to anyway but it's very cool to hear even if you're not physically on the beach very cool to hear what's going on when\nThe show's stars eleven thirty were going to turn over the broadcast to veer show a booth so we are going to actually hear the descriptions of everything that's going on one of which from uh the major who took you a\nJoke or will be doing the narration for the for the London undergarments right yeah yeah very very cool stuff All right so a dean it are going to be out here for a little while we wanted to uh to listen to Jennifer Jones Lee she got a chance to sit down and talk with colonel Aaron Carl\nThe Austin displays you're going to get to see this weekend is from just so compared commandos and we're joined right now by lieutenant colonel Aaron ... who is the public information officer for the so compare commandos colonel thank you so much for joining us this morning\nOh I appreciate it very much\nWhat are the silk ... parents commandos because right added to shoot you guys sound amazingly bad ass\nI we we kinda do I'm not going to lie I'm but I'm parcel out so\nWell start out but the first part so calm on stands for United States special operations command\nAnd what it is is what we refer to as he joined combating command but it it's all the services and and what they did put all the special operations forces in the U.S under one\nJoints on command that oversees everything that they do so um yeah I kinda think that that the cool so did you see on the the Navy SEAL and uh the rangers and the Green Berets combat control\nOther marine raiders um they all have their own command that they also report to the uh the code calmer command combatant commands\nAnd um and a lot of the ... that they do with the things that they're chosen to do can either be joint or as a matter of deciding which unit is going to go on you know figure out what objective so that's what's so common is on the parrot commandos it's the parachute team that represent command so\nWe have a word it only joint survey demonstration team that any kind in the DOT on how you get all the all the services when you get are\nAre we had to fill time numbers that run the team that everybody else is otherwise assigned to sell ... doing you know operation for planning or on computers or training um but then they volunteered to be on a pair of commandos that we have a team of about\nOh roughly twenty five jumpers and ground crew on and when we come to an event like the great Pacific Air show will send usually by six members that will have an area which is that my job for that so I get I'm excited I get to come out to the west coast\nNice um and I\nI I dropped down ... percent drops and safety officer and then uh the jumpers so um you know our job is to represent the command because if you think about it you know even though there's like I said all those court t._v. shows but most of what really happens in real life with these units is not really talked about\nVery much so and you know it's a great honor for us to be able to come out and showed a crowded um you know some of our skills than what we do but also just the the face of sexual operation where it says because I I don't think a lot of people realize that on any given day\nThere are about Seventy one thousand soldiers sailors airmen Marines in the ... under that so calm banner and we're in eighty five countries around the world you know\nI'm so we get to you know shake hands and meet people and and so people will do so it's pretty cool\nThat is awesome yeah because I don't think many people get to see these types of demonstration much ... much less winning all the different forces all underneath wind same umbrella that's pretty impressive now ... the actual group of people you said there are about twenty five of the right and most of you are combat veterans right\nWe have um a lot of people who have direct combat you know our on our team leader or in the right see who will be coming out to California it's a highly decorated green gray\nUm we've got members who are rangers hum and seal the marine raiders but then we also have what we call a special operations neighbors so that people like me I'm not a combat on that but\nStuff where [laughter] where the jet wash picks you up throws you around not that but uh yeah it is amazing I just want to know if this uh seven fifty seven is actually a loaded and it is it being at the show is going to delay my Amazon delivery [laughter] I don't know\nI don't think so I just ask Phil throw it out the window just tell them who you are and that's where I wanted to they could possibility there and uh we also heard um just just a second ago when Jennifer Jones late chocolate colonel Aaron Carl from the so compare of commandos a with part of the demonstrations today\nSupposed to be parachuting in DC Seventeen glove masters another one of those giant cargo airplanes\nThat comes through the air force uses a all the different military branches used for different reasons and that Casey one thirty five strata tanker which is I guess probably roughly the size of a seven thirty seven a little smaller but it's it's it's an amazing I mean that's another part of\nThe uh abilities of the military aircraft that we've seen that in mind blowing this\nNew era and review the strata tanker is the mid air refueling\nJet its job is to hold aircraft fuel and so that other planes can stay up in the air yeah and so talk about\nThe difficulty of taking too massive plane massive planes one loaded with a with highly just about the most flammable substance on planet and a and an actually capturing the two together yeah so that you pass that substance from one to the other end refueled is a ...\nSo one of the questions that I had for a for major fell through the other day in that have sixteen was what's the longest amount of time he has spent I mean in in a plane like that because you're going to burn through fuel pretty quickly even if you of external fuel tanks you're only going to hold an ... a couple of hours worth of or you're only going to have a couple of hours worth of flying time\nSo what was the longest he had spent in that seat glued to that seat flying that airplane he flew from Texas to Spain one time as part of a deployment and it was an F. sixteen it wasn't as if a Thunderbird but it was an F. sixteen\nNine and a half hours he was in that airplane and that included six\nThat really got ... five that that it is ...\n... and if you see them I mean there's one thing to to watch it even cockpit video of an F. Eighteen up sixty whatever it is that's pulling up behind one of these tankers and you know maneuvering that plane to get\nTo capture that fuel line that comes out of the back of the plane that's an amazing amazing thing and then once you were attached there's some at least some some given some leeway that you could float around and you don't have to be a you know exactly on point with your with your flying\nThe fuel line itself is almost a plane and enough itself yeah it has its own air for oil yeah and uh they're controlling it and uh and uh so it's got flaps and ah and because it's not just a rigid structure sticking out I mean it's a ... there's a\nThere's an there's flying the two of the planes and the fuel lines yeah so three things are really being flown at that\nAnd I imagine you know a smaller airplane sixteen for example is going to be easier to maneuver and get into place\nBut air force one air force one is capable of Inflight mid air refueling like that that would be something to witness and I've never seen I don't know if they've they practice it I don't know what the but it is capable admitted refueling which is an unbelievable\nThing I'm sure they'd practices [laughter] somebody's got to write every if there's one thing that holds true across the board in the military is that they practice practice that right it's like well we haven't done this in a few months so uh\nI'm so shocked but but that I Wish that would be a that would be a wonderful thing to see part of a demonstration of part of a nurse or like the submitted refueling as it flies across and\nThat would be pretty fun so there is going to be a simulated refueling these two oh they are I\nAs I understand it a simulated air to air refueling demonstrate oh that's fantastic not only are both of these planes in the show but they are going to be flying to gather a with at least the the refueling apparatus deployed I don't know that they're actually going to hook up\nWe'll have to see that would be it all and that would be very very cool\nSo a deep sharp ... and we're out here at the great Pacific Air show in Huntington Beach\nOr we're going to get involved with the uh the public address actually a little bit later itself\nAs your along the beach you are you going to be able to hear what's going on I you're going to see obviously the planes in the sky and you're going to be hearing from ... jolly the public address announcer for the air show as she describes what's been going on and what's ah what's happening in the skies above us\nBut one of the guys you're going to see is sticky Strickland Paul sticky Strickland Arab ... pilot he's amazing uh flew a F. sixteens he's flown at five she's flown a tens\nAnd he's going to be out there in the L. thirty nine albatross when he's not doing his day job which is actually flying for Southwest Airlines\nI was going to say one of the comforting things to know when you come to an air show like this is the most of these guys fly for major airline yeah you're like well I don't that comforting it is comforting no nobody ... you know\nWhat do you think in a on a a you know in LA to New York's ladies getting a little bored and he's like you know what let's see if this thing everybody got your seatbelts on right let's see if we get a little foreign object to recheck right now I'm a ... degree the degree\nOf competence with these pilots to know that a lot of these guys are actually behind the cockpit when we just get from point a to point B yeah it gives me a lot of confidence oh\nChris little had an opportunity to talk with a with Paul sticky Strickland and here he is\nHey it's Chris little news director here at camp I Am six forty glad you're joining us for the great Pacific Air show I today we're talking with Paul strict Linda otherwise known as sticky he's a retired\nA U.S air force pilot he's flown a tens fives and he asked sixteen he's a former fighter pilot with two hundred and Seventy combat hours and over thirty nine hundred total hours of flying military aircraft you also served as a\nSlot number for a pilot with the United States Air force air demonstration squadron\nThunderbirds any currently flies for Southwest Airlines sticky thanks for joining is\nAbsolutely my pleasure for that um we're really looking to participate in the great Pacific Air show in Huntington Beach they should be a lot of strength\nHow'd you how'd you get the names sticky\n[laughter] a tiny goes back to ... or ... or what times get names that you don't necessarily want 'em or you did something kind of stupid yeah\nUh I showed up in the United\nThem as a young lieutenant in the eight ten and um had my ... ugly glasses on and had a I'm originally from a Santa Ana and the Newport Beach area so I probably got a\nCall ... sticky is California knuckleheads yuppie cars that they\nWere all you have to each of coral yuppies from California [laughter] for that money that\nThat uh that calls I just kind of stuck over the last\nThirty five years or so and I was fortunate enough like you said to have the privilege applying with the um with the thunderbirds yeah and um and it had been planning to slap position but that that kind of kind of a adapted to that you know sticking another slap position as well\nGotcha ... yeah I read about some of the aircraft you flew in one of the most fascinating they're all fascinating but the eight ten I was a pretty fascinated by that tell us a little bit about the eight ten what you did with that thing\nWell I actually flew the coal locally ill known as the hog but the eight ten way it was still a great aircraft for close air support and has really been a stalwart for\nA forty years now and the air force for supporting the ground troops appropriately with a big giant gal a military a grade a gambling on that uh\nThat that does a lot of damn it necessary and can protect our troops so\nI was fortunate enough to apply to eat in a in the Cold War era out of the United kingdom where our mission was to uh basically cover all of a Western Europe\nIn case there was a any kind of invasion across there so I spent all my time down at about two hundred and fifty feet above the ground and some of the worst weather I've flown in or under and um and patrolling and practicing the tactics and whatnot in order to uh go to war we had to European ...\nSo that's basically an aircraft built around a giant machine gun right\nThat's true that's true statement um it's a guy wait through three millimeter gun and um yeah in essence that the way it was designed was to take a lot of beatings and the airplane has done that pass but it's you know it's been a stalwart a in Afghanistan and also in Iraq for\nProviding close support to the army ground troops that are really doing the the essence of the tactical fighting on the ground\nSo that things can be a fly slow and fast\nWell it's a it's not a terribly fast or aircraft from that standpoint at it I mean relatively speaking it flies about three hundred and thirty miles an hour a but compare that to an F. sixteen or that Fifteen or something that is generally faster they're moving around about four hundred and eighty five hundred miles an hour down ... down low\nBut the one thing about the eight ten that was incredible was it a carry a variety of weapons not only just the or the gun but then there are lots of other precision guided weapons and it has a lawyer time working hang around in the battlefield area for a longer than most of the other fighters so that was in a an advantage to the ground troops yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "HOME with Dean Sharp, The House Whisperer", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "21"}
