L. V. which is mass loaded vinyl\nWhich again is a damping a fixture the key is and I say this all the time when it comes to sound proofing I might have told you this before are ... there is no silver bullet one solution to sound proving its layers and the more layers that you use the better results that you're going to get now\nIf you research all of the things that I just mentioned and then have a good conversation with the any competent contractor you can very carefully walk through that and get those things done for I'm not going to see cheap but for a as minimal cost a as possible as opposed to hiring a specialty guy because it's not like it takes\nA tremendous specialty skills it's just the knowledge is just having the knowledge and a and not making mistakes in the in in the process of installing this stuff\nA hope that makes sense married that makes an era hired [laughter]\nThank you so All right so so no just just check all this stuff and then make the list and then start calling local contractors that you trust thank you so much Mary drive time for let's just try try bill welcome home\nBill\nOh hey here my name's sorry about that how's it going [laughter] how

by home and I'm not certain ...\nSame by banks as home that are built onsite they're easily financed and refinance they follow the same market trends as site build houses they have to be structurally approved by building inspectors just like on site build houses a modular homes can be any side\nEven though the block sections that are factory built the modules ah from which they are assembled are relatively uniformly size the house itself can be stacked together and made any side they can have multiple stories\nOr they're often more basic than homes that are built on site just because it's just that kind of a market\nThat but they don't have to be more basic\nThey tend to be listening to me those of you who poo poo modular homes modular homes tend to be\nA dirtier than on site homes and a lot of situations it's the advantage of factory tolerances and the need to for that house to survive the shipping process so today's modular homes are really well made\nThere also highly customized ... a design options prior to construction that you can order into your house and like I said speed is a factor they ... they take anywhere from eight to fourteen weeks to build a in the factory while you can be working\nOn the foundation on site now\nLet's turn to manufactured homes or mobile homes mobile homes only have to conform to the housing and urban urban development code HUD a code they do not have to conform to all the same IRC codes that are modular houses or do\nThey are factory inspected but they don't have to be structurally approved by a building inspector um they're typically manufactured in twelve foot wide sections and they come in usually single double or triple wide options there never more than one story because they have very light very relatively weak\nRibs um roots Ruth's like oops roofs I don't know um\nThey do not have a permanent or conventional foundation but\nThey should be connected to one of\nTheir economical to build because they're built on a trailer body but they're built on a trailer body therefore technically because they're transported to cite on their own wheels and they have to steal ... instead of foundations that are never removed or they are trailers\nAnd they are vehicles and they appreciate in a different way of modular homes don't have to appreciate a some that look like trailers might but they don't have to manufactured homes by definition depreciating\nUm they're placed on the property owned by other people are quite often like a trailer park where the property itself is least by the homeowner you own the trailer but not the land that it's sitting on\n'em and they're treated as a separate lending category from modular and on site built homes that you need to know that as well they're rarely custom designed\nMost buyers choose from some pre built model\nThat maybe is already built in waiting for them like a vehicle um and then a can receive that within days so\nThey are the fastest of all home builds in that regard but they're also things to considers and the lessons to learn from manufactured homes as well which we are going to talk about\nWhen we come back I'm so glad you joined me this morning hang tight

container thought I our radio [noise]\n[noise]\n\nWhen I\nUp I Am six forty more stimulating talk\nYou are all machine sharp the house whisper here every week to help you transform your ordinary house into an extraordinary home\nWe're talking alternate houses today all the different things that so much of the media has made a lot of issue of everything from tiny homes to modular homes to now we're right in the middle of all I Want to finish talking about shipping container houses\nAnd uh [noise] before the break\nI asked you this question of\nThe ... recycling recycling is such a big a front issue with shipping container homes is one of the first things that gets talked about as a pro\nFor investing in a shipping container home because the ideas you they're fourteen million out of service containers in the world so you can take them and transform them at a relatively low cost into your own home and they're strong structural elements and so and there are a lot of fun or if you're into that kind of thing\nBut the question is is it really recycling well\nHere's the thing the environmental appeal of a container home is the idea that you're using a leftover product\nTo make a home and that's great but it's not always true most factory built container homes are built from one used containers single use containers they've had one trip\nAnd the reason is that those factory builders don't want a Benz that are ... are full of rust or dense because they have to spend extra money and labor fixing that stuff before they converted into your house\nSo taking a box with a lot of shipping life out of service after a single use\nIsn't really recycling and you also need to know there's way more steel in a shipping container then you need to build a normal house if you recycled the steel in a normal shipping container it would make enough steel studs for for teen\nAverage size site framed homes of the same size so\nYou know has kind of the the greening of American home building that I talked about so often which are maybe more marketing at times than it is reality also what was in that container when you're getting your hands on one that's been used a lot\nUh it's not always possible to know what's been shipped in it it could be anything from harmless consumer goods too hazardous\nIndustrial materials and you also a lot of these containers come from out of country in places that don't have the same regulations that we have so you want to check\nTo make sure that paints and finishes used on containers um don't contain lead and or that the container hasn't been sprayed down with a toxic ...\nPesticide to keep a critters out okay um\nThe other thing practically speaking about building but the shipping container and this is just if you're getting into it\nIs that a ... they're not greatly insulated and so you we normally have to use a thin layer of very high our values spray foam\nThat spray foam is great in the sense that it makes an airtight insulator it's not so great in that a lot of brands of spray foam give off powerful greenhouse gases in vitro sees\nA which means it's better to build outward on the outside of those walls or to make the wall sticker from the outside of the shipping state or but then what's the use of a heavy corrugated steel ... exterior if you bury it insulation you don't see it anymore\nSo there you go things to consider is that it's not usually really recycling if you're getting the shipping container from a shipping container home company are usually not cheaper if you don't build it yourself and there are limits on your size but what can we learn from it\nCreativity over cost always a an object story can be rewritten if you think out of the box or in this case out of the container right so uh and be aware of the greening of marketing and building materials do your homework alright\nLast step for us today straw bale houses straw bale houses like like tiny homes they've come into their own appendix acts\nOf or the twenty Eighteen IRC straw bale construction yes straw bales are in the building code now they can be use structurally\nOn their own for small scale single floor houses or they can be used underneath larger supporting timber frames\nAre the pros of straw bales is that they are green green and the people who are using them are using them for energy conservation and because they're green they're made from a waste product\nYou know once the edible part of a grain that's been growing in the field has been harvested like wheat or rice", "show_name": "HOME with Dean Sharp,
