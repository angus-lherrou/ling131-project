I\nYour holy host happened to be with you this Sunday is I'm with you every single Sunday right here answering your questions\nAnd talking about things that truly matter in life and the afterlife so let's hear more from you Dan welcome to the Jesus Christ show\nDo Hi Dan how can I help you out with one about whether it was sort of what Richland uh-huh\nWithout a mall or what does that really happened and um one one other question yes um Canada go along with that lady's question how come the universe was so darn big or they only on Iran it\nWell you know everything let's let's go in in order of questions asked first of all look sixteen was you're talking about the parable of the rich man Lazarus\nEarlier I I spoke about how when there is a story being told and scripture it tells you hey this is a story that doesn't mean that the stories not true and it doesn't mean that the story isn't a filled with historical people\nUh it just means that there is a lesson to be learned from the story and that's the focus not the history of\nSo yes the story of the parable of uh the rich men in Lazarus\nHe's told as a parable meaning that there was a lesson or moral based in that story it doesn't mean that it never took place and it doesn't mean that it's false it just means that there's a moral attached that story there are times where there are parables where there are no names or it's just a story\nUm the key there is is that it's not being told necessarily as history it's being told because there's a moral in the story but it also doesn't mean that it doesn't have historical background so it can be bought up all\nNight long rows of you\nKnow terrible which just means that it's a story an illustration that has a meaning behind it a story to teach something\nI'm so it doesn't mean that it's not true and doesn't mean that it is necessarily true it means that the moral of it is what the focus is now your second question about the vastness of the universe\nUm there are constantly more things being seen and heard but that's the equivalent imagined it this way why is there's so much dirt on the earth\nGroup owns\nA well the it it all has to purpose you're absolutely right\nIn the universe you may not always understand the purpose but in scripture it talks about every star being hung by God for a purpose\nSo that whether it's ... and scientists will tell you that the ecosystem of the universe whether you believe that it's closed door open is up to you but the ecosystem of the universe a\n... every little thing that happens has an effect on other things around it as well so whether you know the meaning of those things are not um it's they still have a purpose of\nA some sort and that's part of the question of science is to find out what the purpose of those things are\nGood she a welcome to the Jesus Christ show\nHello how can I help you know [noise] um my question in a proper for a Protestant\nTo communion at ... cafe ...\nWhale proper is the key word there I suppose in the eyes of the Catholic Church no you should not be taking communion 'em to a Protestant it's fine uh but recently my producer Neal was um at a funeral for dear family friend in\nA a Catholic Church and did not take communion out of respect for the Catholic Church because my producer Neal left at the Catholic Church when he was Seventeen and became a Protestant so I'm Out of respect for the Catholic Church\nAnd their belief system um I don't think it's right for a Protestant to to participate in that tradition because they don't believe in the system or the structure of that church but no the heavens aren't going to open and there there's you know people are not\nGod is not going to fall off his throne or anything crazy like that it's just out of respect for the structure of the Catholic Church here in their house and your respecting their rules that's all it comes down to but um\nYou know uh there's been been times where my producer again a would take meaning the Catholic Church after he left and there's times it's not I think that it's out of respect for their system um it's best not to remember there's a lot of craziness going

number eight three three to ask dean eight three three the number to ask dean All right before the break\nI uh hinted at the fact that there was a gigantic a haunted house in Southern California that or even a well most people don't know about and even a lot of ghost enthusiasts don't know about and there's a reason why\nThe bard mansion in a point why knee me California it was built in Nineteen twelve\nIt as a seven teen thousand square foot Spanish Colonial revival mansion I mean this is an\nOld huge huge old old mansion\nAnd uh and it's haunted apparently by the barge themselves Mr and Mrs barred a art scene there quite often and some of their servants and\nThings like that but a white has a nobody seen I I don't live all that far away from it and up until last year I had no idea it even existed\nWhy because it is now located within the confines of the point ... naval airbase which is not worth the general public gets very often however\nOr the or\nThe navy actually uses it as a conference center and they have meetings there and all sorts of stuff\nBut they do open it to the public\nA on a regular basis for ghost tours and stuff so you need to look it up is so you're into that you look up the board I think on Halloween Night every year they actually do a full a multi course dinner\nAnd then live music magic show and then around midnight they take an actual a ghost tours flashlight goes to or through the ... I think I'm pretty sure that still happen\nAnd how to fix it or we're also talking about real haunted houses today before the break I said this and this is true quite often considered America's most haunted house\nWhere would you think that is like back east somewhere right in the northeast right some you know somewhere in Maine where Steven\nKing lives no it's actually in San Diego the Wally house in San Diego where's my info on a built in Eighteen fifty seven okay now here's the key built in Eighteen fifty seven on the site of a public gallows\nAlright so first of all have we not learned I guess maybe an Eighteen fifty seven they hadn't figured this out yet but you know there are rules there are rules for surviving haunting number one don't split up number two if you are right in the middle of it do not have sex\nIt's sexist ... the people who have sex always die before the end of the film number three and this is a biggie don't build a house on an Indian burial ground or the sight of public\nExecutions [noise] it's very simple anyway uh so the Wally houses is actually been referred to as America's most haunted house Yankee Jim Robinson frequent the house\nBecause he was apparently was hang there in Eighteen fifty two and also the ... around there still I don't know why they're around but apparently there hey anyway let's talk to you want to talk to a real people about real houses\nDebbie welcome home\nLA uh so far so good well can I Do for you\nI mean I haven't really found out and Carl some\nRadical regularity and then they go out and it sounds like it's coming from but I don't know\nAbout ten years and years and [noise]\nAll right so it's not a crack physical crack that you can see you're talking about cracking sound\nYeah how are\nYou know what okay so and you said it's a townhouse yeah okay and and it's not that old right it's who you said in Fifteen Years older than I could get\nHurt on the outside well okay I could have guessed that I'll tell you what so this kind of address is one of our of big issues and that is the rooms that pop and crack\nHouses\nAre made of multiple layers and stick to frame houses meaning houses that are made out of framing lumber\nUh think of the framing itself as a bones you know a I'm a little older than Fifteen but still on a regular basis there are times when ah you know all bend over all twist sideways and\nAn unexpected crack occurs back behind me usually from my spine or my neck okay\nAnd that and that's because my Bones Are they've got various tensions pulling against them in different directions throughout the course of the day I use that as a realistic metaphor for what happens to our houses it's nothing to fear\nAnd it's nothing to be all that worried about especially new or structures and especially newer structures that are connected\nTo other larger structures like townhouses in condos it's really very calm and that in the middle of the night or day I mean you just notice it more at night because everything gets quiet and you're just laying there and and there's no other background noise happening but\nEvery once in awhile enough tension and settling builds up also the lumber in your home or was when the when the house was first built when the structure was first built was green green lumber meaning that it was wet and had a high moisture content\nUp that lumber from the day that it goes into the house for a good twenty to Thirty years is slowly but surely drying out and also shrinking a little bit\nSo all of those things combined together cause the occasional cracking\nOr it doesn't mean it's falling apart it simply means that the house is slowly aging and settling into its own and all those tensions build up and they usually manifest in one location and all of a sudden uh unexpectedly you'll get a you know ...\nAnd uh and then it's over for a while until detention builds up again so there you go\nA long very old house you know we never had a crack like\nThat because that's because the sixty year old house has probably already settled into itself it's found its own level the lumber has already shrunk as much as it's going to shrink and uh it has stabilized but younger home uh takes time to stabilize yeah what was your real quick\nI have a concrete slab on the ground floor we install the hardwood floor we use\nA lot\nOf rain rain that you know and then a glow and what it all up and how I Want to re installed the hard way that I Want to make sure I get it right and I looked on line and there are a variety of different ways to do it\nThey don't do it at all so\nOkay so here's the so it's and it's on a slab on the first floor\nYeah and it kept\nIt before\nSo it only means one thing ... why would means moisture right and the reason the cops is because would expands when it gets wet\nAll right and if there's a if the top of the hardwood floor is dry\nAnd the bottom layer of the hardwood floor gets wet and expand it grows larger than the top layer therefore as it grows larger it makes a little bowl shape it makes a cup along the plank of a hardwood All right\nSo you got to pull it up once you pull it out you got to get back down to the lab and before you do anything first thing you need to do is check to see if there was some kind of systemic\nMoisture problem in the slab which means you need to have it moisture tested and up and verified that you've got a you know blow a five percent moisture content in the slab you don't want to lay anything down now\nThere seems to be a problem you should probably talk to a pro about it but generally speaking if there has been a problem uh find out where the moisture is coming from maybe the slab membrane has failed maybe there's a plant or next to the room\nThat to where the dirtiest too high and too much irrigation water is leaking in through the side of the slab being sucked in like a sponge\nThere was a number of reasons that could cause that kind of thing\nThen once it is sufficiently dry just to just to absolutely secure\nYourself you need to cover that slab with some kind of like a red guard membrane some kind of pick Neil water proofing membrane and then on top of that I Want you to use a glue for your new hardwood floor that it is that itself\nIs waterproof so you're going to solve the problem number one you're going to get to the root of it you're going to make sure that the slabs dry enough then you're going to put down an actual a thick layer of water proving membrane on the surface of slab and then you're going to install the hardwood with waterproof adhesive\nYou do all of those things and the next floor will not act like the current slur okay\nAll right hey guess what finally on the weekends we get to give away a thousand dollars to I'm going to give away a thousand dollars\nBefore the end of the show so hang tight with me and also if you've got questions about your home I've got answers eight three three to ask dean is the

themselves are usually only long enough to go in\nThe jam itself which is about three quarters of an inch deep\nAnd over the time the weight of a door can put too much pressure on the gym so you're going to undo the ... the screws of the ... of the door the top inch where it goes into the gym\nThen you're going to fold that hinge plate back so that you can see the exposed little pocket and before you put it back on you're going to get yourself a nice long two or three inches long a would screw\nAnd you're going to screw that in not we're one of the screw holes is\nIn another location in that pocket you're going to screw that in so that goes all the way through the gym into the lumber next to it which is the tremor there is a two by four or to buy six right on the other side there\nAnd you're going to see as as the head of that screw starts to hit the gym you're going to see the whole jam\nKind of pull over a little bit now you don't need to do it much don't go crazy with it you need to probably pull it over about an eighth of an inch or so then fold the hinge played back on pop your normal hinges back in and guess what\nProbably not going to stick anymore because what we've actually done as we stuck to the top of the jam over to the framing a little better than it was before right\nCome on that was worth the price of admission right there okay uh sometime soon very

its own as it were before the break I said that I grew up next to one of the most real haunted places in Southern California it's not a house it's a bridge you know what Bridget is\nAnyone it's\nThe Colorado Street Bridge right on the edge of a Pasadena in eagle rock is first of all a gorgeous\nGorgeous bridge\nOr we should still build bridges it looked like this was built in Nineteen Thirteen but there have been ever since the year it was built well over\nA hundred documented suicides off that bridge\nAnd now I Am told if you go there at night or you sometimes can see a man a jumping off the side and him and people pulled their cars over a out of panic and they run over to the edge and they see him going down but he never hits the ground\nHe never hits the ground also sometimes cars were to avoid a woman who is a crossing a bridge or but then who disappears at the last second so\nI've never seen that then again I've never been on that bridge in the middle of the night because I Am saying okay\nAll right uh let's take a call Jon welcome home\nJohn ... hey buddy how you doing a great show thank you yeah they're waiting\nTo get through a yeah down from construction my show everybody shares right on obviously [laughter] um I live in a hot but when I got a regular home here and then the summertime it gets really warm to our shoulders Latham clashed or with a insulation in the wall\nShow it stays cool do in the day and then at night it gets warm and I was wondering about a real fan\nA whole house fan yeah go on line and I get all these different or a real fan does you're no good no house fan work but it seemed like a whole has fan would pull Erin from um you know from ... in the wall or something I'm not even sure how they\nWould act sharia let me let me explain the difference so that now do you have air conditioning no I Do not\nOkay so you don't uh so ... the uh just actually a common question should I get an addict fan or a whole house fan and which one works better will there actually two completely different animals and they do two completely different things\nAnd addicts fan is a fan that is designed to come on and blow hot air that builds up in the attic out of the addict now that helps keep the house cool\nEr during the day and in the evening day or night just because it's not allowing the addict to build up in a in a inordinate amount of heat\nBut an addict fan works its effectiveness is really completely based on uh how well vented the addict is because not only do you have to have a blowing out of the addict but then you have to have another event somewhere adequate vent square footage to draw air or back into the addict otherwise you're just pulling against a vacuum and it doesn't work", "show_name": "HOME
