Carlos and it's about\nHour and eight minutes before this game get started with go right back out to Cleveland where ... and Daniel are sitting down with a little bit more now\nYeah how about this one of the uh one of the rare occurrences and all the professional football you get a big defensive mind in the booth to analyze loving him and the uh the benefit of of that as us right here at Cleveland as we get ready for chargers and browse to get things going just after ten am\nOur time it is a all packed well a couple of two or three times I think out there at Arizona State then of course with the ramps for a long while it's out of march or letters on the broadcast for the rest of your ideas for CBS\nAdam obvious first question or as a safety and no one would that position\nTo do out there what do you make a during when James start what did you think of him when he was Florida State and and how about this study had his career\nYeah first thing that [noise]\nYou know scheme is so important to a lot of players you know there's very few players that can just go out there and play in any skiing right well what guts Bradley is asking if there are when James fits his skill set\nTo an absolute tyranny tailor made for that strong safety position that the thing that really kind of stands out though is he's a big guy he's great in a box ... but he plays a lot of post safety of it is really good back there he's got great instincts and he's a really good open field tackled so\nYou know he does things that a traditional pure box strong safety doesn't do and I expect to see 'em a lot here in the post safety in this game and oh what a start to a season and he's playing confidently you know to come in here and play confidently be aggressive\nLove to see that from young players haven't played the position and and just looking back in history as anybody you played against her with that he reminds you of just skill set wise he's just he's a unique guy back there um you know I think the the obvious comparison nobody that I really played\nYou know the biggest safety in my day was maybe Roy Williams in Dallas [noise]\nTo say much much different athlete much more diverse you know he's a big boat Bob Sanders who reminds me yeah\nYeah yeah I was a shorter guy be places that same kind of reckless abandon out there running around he got you see him he's just aggressive and he's confident in in I think that's the main thing that it doesn't matter what position you play in the NFL young players\nPlay fast and play competing that's the number one thing and if you can't do that you'll never achieve your full potential and it's fun to see guys like James doing it in a war does another guy and as we all know the hardest position to play confidently in the NFL quarterback and Baker may feel those are the that's why these young guys were having success\nAre you surprised by that at all with Baker and and the start that he's gotten off the\nUm because I just know how hard it is you know we see rookies really struggle\nAnd what I really like about I mean it was from the very first moment he came in the jets game of it's just the concept of letting it rent and having confidence in having conviction in your throat and when I met with huge accident you know there's always this this given take no how do you balance you know being aggressive\nChallenging a defense with not being careless with the football and putting the ball in harm's way and I love choose answer he said you know what I trust him and I'm not going to hold them back\nHe's shown in college she can take care of the ball you could play company I'm not going to do that here with him or this year and so far he's been rewarded I think they're letting them know they're not overloading in there's not a ton of concepts that they're running\nJust going out there and make it plays but his confidence in his conviction is really what stands out sets him apart from not just young quarterbacks but\nThe best ones from the average ones quite honestly you don't have to unload the whole the whole Volpe here but just one key you think one key in this football game today a number one key and what I'm really looking forward to is seen as brown defense against rivers especially if the line of scrimmage in pre snap [noise] um\nAs you guys know you've got to disrupt him\nHe handles pressure better than anybody he has answers they've got a great deeply action game they've got the ... underneath\nHow does Gregg Williams disguise their defense both he and Joe Schober the inside linebacker they're going to be a lot of check with me there's going to be a lot of playing off each other who has the chalk last and then who was able to execute but to me that that's going to be the story this game\nOr should be an exciting one no doubt about it the old man Philip Rivers versus the other young lad Baker made deal making just a third start of his career or at a Marshall that are going to be on the call\nWas spirited us for CBS we appreciate you taking out a couple of minutes in the helping us out here you know prompt Lovett excited for this game there we go and also Chandler

[noise]\n\nI'm Talking about electricity\nThe problem with most online electrical wiring tutorials is that they're all about the wiring and they avoid the subject of electricity itself what is it how does it behave where does it come from where does it want to go\nAnd I could walk you through a step by step tutorial on wiring up a switch but in addition to be a ... uh do you know boring you to death the real problem is when you're all done you're not going to do any more about the electricity itself than when we started and so I don't want to go there\nI Am of the opinion and obviously I consider my opinion the best opinion because it is my opinion but I Am\nDefinitely a faculty member at the teach a man to fish school not the give a man a fish school so when it comes to electrical wiring in your home I Am convinced that if you begin to grasp what electricity is in the first place then suddenly all of the wiring begins to make sense\nSo you're getting a house whisper exclusive hear what you're a science teacher failed to explain effectively obviously because you don't remember it and what very likely even your own electrician cannot explain to you effectively I Will now attempt to do\nIn the next four minutes\nOn the radio so here we go are you ready alright\nElectricity starts with electrons\nFrom when it gets its name\nElectrons are parts of Adam's you know the stuff that everything is made of we've all seen the classic diagram of an Adam where it looks like a little planet the nucleus is being orbited by several little moons or dots those orbiting dots are the electrons\nAnd here's what you need to know they are particles\nThat means that they are things they're not energy everything that exist\nIs made of Adams including you and me and every Adam has its little orbiting electron\nOkay got it just think of that image the classic image of an Adam just luck that in your head okay next step here's where the magic happens\nSome materials hold onto their electrons very selfishly while others are okay sharing the electrons\nWith other Adams so picture a bunch of those Adam images all lined up in a row but instead\nOf the electrons orbiting each individual Adam imagine that there's like a strong wind blowing them all along the row of Adam's from one to another to another almost like water passing over stones\nIn a river when water starts flowing all in one direction we call it\nA current or water current and when a lecture on start flowing all in one direction from Adam to Adam Adam we call it yes\nAnd electrical current boom there you are you are now he physicist\nThe flow of electrons from one Adam to another is an electrical currents\nBut remember this the electrons themselves they are not energy just like in a current of water the water isn't energy but there is energy they're hiding in the motion itself\nSo teen and I just got back from spending some time in northern New England and one of the most romantic images that you'll ever see\nIs the site of an old mill built next to a river with a big water wheel gently turning on the side as the water passes by right we all know that's very pastoral scene\nSo our for our forefathers knew that if you stick a water wheel down into the water with some paddles on it that resist the flow of the current the energy in the current\nSpins the wheel and makes the meal do its work saw mill grain meal whatever kind of militant\nSo picture that likewise if I Know dip\nA light bulb or a motor into an electrical currents I get to take some of that energy that's flowing past to light up the ball or to spin my motor\nMy water meal doesn't consume water does it the water passes on by and my light bulb doesn't consume electron they just pass on by\nAnd what we want out of both is to steal away some of the energy that is moving the current the electrical current or the water current in the first place and this\nIs really important for you to understand I Would say the number one fact about electricity that most people do not understand\nIs that it doesn't flow to our lights and switches an outlet and appliances it flows through them and it continues on its way\nAnd if you can understand that like the water wheel in the middle of a river then you have taken your first step in truly understanding your home wiring\nEvery switch every outlet every appliance the light in your home just like the paddles on the water wheel are referred to as ... and they are all wired\nAlong a circuit a circular path of current that doesn't end at the appliance just like the river doesn't stop at the water wheel but your electrical current comes out of your main panel runs through your appliance and returns to your panel every\nOne of our electrical electrical devices are like middle wheels dipped\nThe river are you with me\nYeah you are and now you're like the smartest person in the room alright couple of more things we've got to explain to complete the picture

insulator so what is the perfect example of each things like copper\nAnd water are excellent conductors they let electrons go they let them slow materials like wood and rubber do not allow their electrons to flow those are insulator so\nAlmost all home electrical wiring is made from copper because it lets slow in order to get these great currents flowing through your house and all of that\nCopper wire is wrapped in rubber inflation so that the current state slowing inside the wire doesn't jump out into other highly conducted materials nearby like you since you are made primarily

home at the heart of your beautiful life uh before the break I asked the question did Benjamin Franklin actually fly a kite in a thunderstorm\nYes or no\nOr we don't actually know for sure this is an issue of ongoing debate or what we do know is that he wrote an article\nAbout\nThe experiment of flying a kite in a thunderstorm and tying a key to the end of the string\nAnd then from that he as a conductor of electricity channeling that down into a capacity jar a so that he could verify that lightning was indeed a form of electricity\nWhether or not he actually did the experiment is a absolutely not clear\nOr some people say yes and that he used his son to hold the string [laughter]\nOr other people say no it was just all theoretical uh but we do know that is that if you had flown to ... ... if he had been holding the string when it actually got hit by lightning or that would have been the end of a Benjamin Franklin's illustrious career so it's good\nThat he did it at least do that part okay to the phones Maryland Welcome home\nMarilyn\n\n\nI tried water water on the ground I see like I Know in my mind around in our house [laughter]\nYou know you know why that is because you do [laughter] sorry how can I help\nYou out right tree lighting\nAnd soccer I struggle with our family socket\nWell honestly I Wonder if you guys get fewer than ... ... ...\nIt really like it or not right for the average price in our area the K are\nA lot [laughter] why we pay every black light yup there but we haven't really found that it might have a problem with direct or it just made it very well are we going very far\nUh you know what this is actually a pretty common issue when people are retrofitting Eli de lights into their homes and I'll tell you what it is not there's nothing wrong with your electricity okay\nAnd there's nothing wrong with the bulbs her say chances are that now is the chances are that the issue is the dimmer okay now oh ... kind of embrace this idea Eli D's\nDraw very very little power very little power over their entire spectrum so you start with a very very small amount of ... and then you didn't that down to almost zero ... when you Jim them right\nHowever incandescent bulbs or halogen bulbs are normal high voltage evolves from the past they draw a lot of watts okay and so ... that are designed for old incandescent systems they have what you ... you might call kind of a\n... of of a gross or the dimming a\nRange in which you know if you knock a hundred watt incandescent bulb and you're only giving it a ten watts of power a then that ball goes out that's a full damn right even though there's power running through it you ... down to the point where it looks like it's not on anymore\nBut a dimmer that on the low end is a at\nTen watts of power\nFor a a four Nelly ... that's like that's [laughter] that's like half the power of the ... and so that's why when you plug your ... into this particular ... ah it's probably like a three hundred vote Democrat\nOr a when you plug the ... into this ... or or I'm Sorry three hundred watt them or\nUm you plug them in and you ... down and they just did a little bit and that's because the dimmer isn't cutting enough of the power out of that bolt and so you you just need to run back to the hardware store\nTell them hey I Need a dimmer that's matched to Eli de bulbs that goes all the way down and you put that went in and uh it's going to do just fine okay Marilyn hey thanks for the call and thanks for the encouragement about ah the electrical show I really appreciate that All right uh let's talk to\nMike Mike welcome home\nYou know going man good good\nA deal so I don't know a whole lot of money but I Do need a\nFairly sizable cage built\nIn my garage and I'm hoping to use the existing structure\nAre just so it's real strong\nIs there a way that I can go about doing that without a you know breaking the piggy bank open\nUh so what are we talking about a ... you have a dog or you're going to farm animals [noise]\nWe're talking about a little bit more than just a couple of beagles here is good and we need to be a pretty big cage in ... just like a real strong\nOkay so is this something that's just getting used every\nDay [noise] no no probably more like once a month or so which is a lot of prep time I'll be able to you know if you need to like ... or something I can probably do that okay Mike\n\nDo we have all I Can't Ripley problem here\n[noise] I didn't want to just you know [laughter]\nThere's someone in your home aware of my\nThree I'm aware of and uh I just ah you know I'm tired of coming home with shredded up jeans and you know somebody else's\nAh you know wallet on me [laughter] ah you know somebody else's blood on\nMe All right Mike I listed I appreciate your transparency and your vulnerability so here's the thing they're not a lot of a wearable rated materials down at the hardware store doing me so [laughter] so I'm going to suggest this uh you you could take a normal cage and put like wolf's being\nAround the outside of it because it even though the bars technically they're only going to resist you when you're in\nFull transformation the wolf Spain's gonna kinda kinda keep you in place but here's my preferred thing or is chains forget about the cage because you know cages only frustrating you're right I mean it's only frustrating your deep animal instinct so how about\nA nice solid chain that you can get at the hardware store you get like a five ton rated toad Shane Shane yourself\nUp since some uh some deep a\nFoundation bolt into the center of your slabs of that chain has got a good anchor point put those rated toe genes in there and it's also you know you can use another when they're only like thirty bucks apiece at home depot and you can also use another one for a you know hanging raw meat rock and like a five\nLocated in your home below five and a half feet off the floor\nIs to be a camper resistant outlet the good news about this is the temper resistant outlets look exactly like regular outlets and you don't have to move the cover and you don't have to take out a little piece of plastic instead it's somewhere and get it last\nTamper resist an outlet all the magic is happening behind the face played there are these two white plastic tabs little shutters that come down and block\nOff each of those

you plug to take the court out\nThe shutters close and now it is tamper resistant once again and again the good news on tap resist an outlet a regular outlet cost about a buck fifty the tapper resistant outlet about two fifty so\nNot a huge investment to change out the outlets in the house and make them child safe\nFifty five hundred outlet related injuries mostly children and this was no surprise sixty nine percent boys happen every year\nBoys just stick and stuff where they don't belong\nOkay that didn't sound right All right we are going to move on in the Eighteen eighties there was

remodeling\nBathrooms and uh my contract or advice that I should break the concrete shower pan and report\nTo ensure that it is a water type in all I Want to do is remove the tile and then the current and then start recalling you know we do tile is it necessary to do that\nOr are there any indications that it's leaking\nUh no it's been there for probably the original bathroom the how the home was built to seven so which dry rotted I broke all the the the wall traveled down dry wall and stuff in the woods fine\nAnd is this upstairs downstairs it are you on a sub floors slap\nIt's downstairs and I'm On a slab\nOn a slab downstairs no sign of the shower pan leaking\nUh no indications of that um and it there's ceramic tile in there right now\nUh yeah okay um [noise]\nI'm not really unless he's got some other concern that you're not expressing to me I'm not really seeing why or to break it all out of the the water proofing for your shower pan is not right under the tile or here's what you've got you've got your you the the the shower\nAnd that was built up in the first place or when the house was first built there was some concrete put in there on a slope and ... was brought up to it and then either a hot mop or PVC if it was done in a while back it was a hot mop layers and layers of hot asphalt an asphalt paper\nAll are making an actual seal there and then on top of that waterproof layer is another whole a layer of mortar to slope to the top of the drained its that mortar that the title is\nIs right on top of so would you carefully ... if your if your shower PIN number one isn't leaking right now we're shows any sign of it\nAnd you carefully or are you carefully demo out the titles so that you're not disturbing much of the concrete underneath it you'll never get anywhere near the waterproof layer and so I don't think there's any reason why you have to mess with it now you could always do this you can test your shower pan\nAnd what you do is you run down to the hardware store and into the plumbing section there they sell these little ... they're basically balloons rubber balloons that are made to block drain lines you take off the drain great stick this thing down in their pump it up with a a like a bicycle pump\nSo that the drain has clogged basically creating a temporary clog and then filled the shower pan up with water\nAnd let it sit there for a day and see if the water in any way shape or form drops down if the water drops in levels significantly you know half an inch or an inch than your shower pan is leaking but if that water stays in there\nThen you you don't have any leak and you can just go right ahead and you know why spend the extra effort has that helped\nOut of that that debate healthy that greasy of your time our borough thank you thank you Bye bye\nOr let's talk two miles smiles welcome home\nHey thanks for taking my call them a a got a bit of a road and problem and I hope you can help young\n[noise] yeah so like you know no matter what
