{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "Yeah about thirty minutes ago or so you had talked about how genius this um if the ticket as being murder and the ... but not in the Bible and I think a seminary student I'm a minister I studied and a couple of different Bible college is and\nIt says very clearly in scripture that genes or a no one could take his life he said that he laid it down willfully he later down voluntarily I think that's why the Bible doesn't ever mentions\nJesus as being murdered because of course he spoke of how that if he wanted to he could have probably jealous of angels that with comic and uh they would have helped him to escape that death that he voluntarily late as life down for I'd like to hear your\nComment on that and I are all early on and off the air\nOr don't don't don't go anywhere I think it's fair let me just say it it's a matter of just how the current depicted in the in the current and it really it's just I'm doing a\nI'm doing essentially a word study right and so I'm looking at the at the Hebrew and looking at the Greek and I'm looking at the Arabic for the word murder or kill ... which is what\nIs implied in some in some stories but they don't actually use the word murder the only reason I brought it up as I thought it was significant that the the ... murder is a very very very big deal in Islam\nIt's not it's just you know people often talk about Islam and the you know they make all these characterizations about Muslims and it's just really unfair because murder any kind of death anytime you're killing something that's a big deal and it's not\nAnd so the fact really the elevation is really my point was that they were elevating the death of Jesus by using the word\nMurder or they weren't pulling a punch and I think that's cool um as for um as for other things you know I think you're you know that's an interesting thought I Can't get in the mind of the\nOf the Bible writers who felt like that was but I I Know that sometimes murder is sold softly in the Bible the word murder exists they exist there Hebrew words for murder but they don't use it all the time and said that you kill a which is more neutral and sounds almost in some cases justifiable let me go to Alex who's in New Hampshire\nUntil she goes to him and I'm afraid I started something Alex it probably [laughter] probably I don't know how he got his start in I'm Sorry I'm dragging everybody into this but I Hope the obits conversation you're enjoying anyway Alex ...\nI I Am enjoying it and I'm like I'm taking my call 'em I spoke with you here to go buy the book I'm interested in or whatever I hear you I'm ... I'm always thinking along the lines that with the decline [noise] um [noise] I I ... I met her through a book called crank awkward Jesus [laughter] I'm\nFrom the from the turn of the last century right yeah\nYeah I think it was published in the like you know eight\nUm apparently with what they pay acquainted with the introduction of like it was has transcribe written transcribed by Levi deli\nRegret scribe it from the uh carsick record off and on his dog for a book or a member of the way of putting it [laughter] I'm fascinated with this book because it is her role in many ways for for for comfortable um\nAnd describing like Jesus and also covered the so called missing here is that it's like a highly ... locked in years or so [noise] um but if they're talking about the different ages and that that they're full of full title of the book is very current gospel of Jesus karma price hike in age\nAnd summer and I'm not I'm not an expert on his work but I'm fascinated with the idea of the return of the Christ and I'm not I'm not a conservative Christian I'm ...\nI'm more in line with the Quakers and I'm back in ... um the beginning of an age where they could be a great age because if they disagree with Iraq\nThat you know yeah ours is that correct I'll go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're bringing I've just come in and your questions you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in or is this just this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and ... you know all we can ever do is the arise\nBecause we can't there's no there's no met a\nData so that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... [noise]\nSo yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history and it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what something that just otherwise would be completely morphing he's way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I mean I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I've looked it up several times and\nAnd it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it and it just sort of Lincoln it's sort of exist up there especially in the part about that period of time the missing so called years um because there's a lot of different books that address that I don't want that they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all those different when I'm familiar with the government or ... years I'm ... I didn't want to a wrap it up quickly are a lot of could go into a bucket for wanting to say um I I agree with that guy for head of what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier with different color you\nI'm Talking about life along the lines of\nIt if you you appreciate the freedom we how are we we all worship something you know whether it's money or ... or whether it's caught him or herself um that we really appreciate that freedom at your church because they can work your way\nI I I appreciate that but I also think there's a there's a downside of the earth sure because I think it's because you know we have the freedom but we don't always use it responsibly oh yeah we have a responsibility not just to ourselves individually but can we collectively\nCouldn't agree more have some kind of shared values every\nBattle yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political here I I think what holds us together as a country is a I\nI don't fixate on borders I understand the importance of security I'm I'm On board with that but when people talk about each the border that makes us a country that's just not true you know it's not the border that makes me in Arizona and write or should it be a a cans and isn't a like didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think what holds together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we don't teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to we aren't philosophy should be where every education starts I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers based the entire country I think\nThat's what we need to always focus on that's the that's the most important thing to other things are also important but that is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot\nAh for people who don't find it interesting pardon the bladder but gosh darn it those great thank you so much for jumping in an open lines and look forward to tomorrow night so the most elusive serial killer\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case let them make the decision I Want to think uh George no recourse boroughs one thing leads to
