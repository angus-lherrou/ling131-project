coast to coast will take your phone calls next ours we talk about this high technology artificial intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age\nIf I were in the long mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence is it that bad\nI I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about was what we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that we don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple\nWe would have never said well what if your cyber all turns on you what if your calculator decides to turn on you then what if your smartphone does so the question\nOr will the machine turn on you we see that in movies a lot right oh yeah and we ... we knew something called reasoning for fictional evidence which says will be seen so many times in movies maybe at what really happened but\nWe know these technologies can do an enormous amount of good they can they can feed the hungry and diagnose illness and do all of these things and I'm not sure that introducing an element of like it may turn on is uh\nThat that may be more that that may do is a lot more harm than than than good if it's ... it's very little suggest the machine what did I Know through through accidents are absolutely you\nKnow you had a rocket blow up because a single one was a transposed with a ... and opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one ... air airplane full of people\nThink you've got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer fly all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack like that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one that they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross in the ... and just really the incredible growth of this kind of technology\n... ... is it the human being\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist to make sure you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that for a very interesting reason which was\nNewt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a bunch of money came and everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took a nap for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it it can it if you out of business it can make public any department in your business than ... percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advanced ... and I ah we probably had twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense has a ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nI just fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said uh it was a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a puppy or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also stiffer gunpowder\nAnd you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to\nUm if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a ton of his killing systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nUm could could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so uh it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're gonna for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a a weapon systems spin out\nWell for for three very easy reasons you could argue that ah they're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are you then argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ... a ... and ... and whatever country you are and and\nThird you know they will they will work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost going to war which uh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nAbsolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapons systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and that you know if if one has no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the day though by run that you know we're coming up to the top of the hour we'll finishing up when we come back next hour but\nYou know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial like cars with driverless cars do you see the day that uh you know all the entire post office system will be done because they'll deliver and with artificial male people for example\nThink about that will be back\nTo find out where George ... speaking ... scroll down to the bottom including George ...\n[noise] I just

a feeling that any job at a machine can do\nWe really want machines to do it I mean 'cause if if the machine can do a job to make a human do that job there's word for that that's called the humanizing mhm because if if you just use a person for staying in\nPoor machine then you're saying nothing about you that makes us human are we interested in we only need you to be a machine that we invented a is delivering the mail\nOr or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine young machine that automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies\nThis country for two hundred and fifty years has ... has had unemployment between five and ten percent all the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years half of the jobs vanish\nAnd so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years\nRight and we had rising wages and because so why are we able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out at everybody sees as it and says I'm going to use this to increase by on productivity so whatever\nIf you can self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city\nIf you are I mean like\nIt it's hard it's hard to necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if it went back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's gonna be this ... billion people are going to use it what do you think there's going to do their jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were gonna vanish she would say well that's going to be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise]\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you when you see at sea air B. and B. Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs are going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEverybody every time technology makes a great job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the later when a lot I don't I don't think a robot can do\nA what a way to do you know you you still a drink\nYou know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThere you have a special order you want you want to send your back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we had this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do with a two year old can do let alone and an adult yeah so\n... correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long\nSo right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nUm people are going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movements you're not going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your well out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets that right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kind of wherever that um but like you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer can\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we have these mines and which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm you've got three hundred and two neurons in his brave they spent Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer just pick a worm that lives in a computer with a brain that three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so there are so many we're we're so\nSpectacularly amazing\nUh beings that that to duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we are able to do\nAnd and\nWe've used it to overcome scarcity\nBecause for law of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was not tourists anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor and the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened uh you invented a nation state and that's why five thousand years ago you can kind of set your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge ... America and just go over the world and so I Do think that\nUm that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we're the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called them robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with the mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast uh\nYou're you're right that sort of fictional intelligent you it is to be frightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how terrifying once that and yet we don't look back and said that was a bad thing do we\nThe stall was working on the beach and they had the boy helping them one of those papers and you know if they're really a reason to be at an all the time and Trump to an office one when

GDP did go up to eight fold just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air

could've machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or what we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human

that\nWe push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate that\nIs allegedly going on is whether are we going to you know make more dead systems that operate completely economists say that you can just\nIn an area and it will go and decided that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but bart I agree with you\nBefore the age

know within the organization thing you know very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories and they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you make this up\nHere that you're that nerd we went and [laughter]\nAnd and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people and have kind of gone with me on the

than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their you know talk about their experiences because\nThere's so many people have had him and I also wanted them to you know what I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happening and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that people are all into the ... like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners and because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go because I you know when this started happening to me um\nI didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit about medium ship just you know some of the things in a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and goes so we're almost the majority\nWere barely a minority and that's grown up\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that would be over fifty percent I I Would think so and the second is that\nI worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get\nThis and every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds\nSomeone in North America is doing the work is\nNot always saying yes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening um but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey\nI had a way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nHave nothing to hide and you have nothing to hide ...\nJourney started for you because of a personal situation\nYes did you did\nThis started from me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey Adderall transformational

everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world and\nNot long after she passed I started seeing ghosts and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I opened a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes world holder guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs with if\nYou have been doing sham me these were kind of camera [laughter]\nAnd I found I use and what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise] um it\nWas I thought I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Samsung camera not found but like a

free this is Henry look authentic for die by\nOn all of them do\nI certainly have a philosophy about that man I don't know if it's true but I kind of have a philosophy and where do you think well\nWhat I think that happens and and Heidi Heidi really covers this so beautifully um because she did she have a lot of people um to me you know email and talk to her about their experiences\nAnd there was an experience where um there was that there was a man who was ... experience they probably actually spoke to that man had men like\nDoesn't really have facial features he where it's like a foot door and sometimes a coat but what people get the feeling they have is just out of fear right because they'll see this kind of a shadowy figure while they are their bodies paralyzed but they're awake and\nAnd one man asked you know who are you and he said they called me scratch and scratches another name for the devil\nBack in the day when he tried to Adam and Eve away from God to okay you get them scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory it's all it's a theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit the spirit goes off and parties and the actual face I'm sure many people have talked about this for planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think that's a little space before it lands properly and you are aligned on is when this can happen\nAgain it's just a theory which are pretty good\nIt's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition that I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have at our bad because you know what\nThe light doesn't need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark but dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I Hope people will read the book I'm\nAt what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to duplicated duplicated that experience yeah yeah I can handle it now you would really yeah I could would you couldn't\n[noise] um it was um oh let me just tell them I just tell your audience what happened\nWhat I'll do it if you want me to George uses like\nAll right I'll tell you we have a couple of minutes yeah owes you use it something about the blackout oh I'm Sorry\nIs when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes Oh yes so I have I but I just tell everybody instead of just the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called in one night and said I saw that happening again\nAnd and he spoke to me and what he said to me was how her my name is Ron and I went he he said what\nHe said how her by name as wrong as I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of I accept that it was not very nice jeeze and I said and he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou say that was him\nI don't think it was my accept that but I think it was that man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare you they're going to find that thing that triggers you right there I find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that\nAnd and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which is now I mean do you ... your in control of what's happening\nI I Am I Am I Am now because I now understand that I Am in charge I completely understand you and I am also I've become fearless\nUse the

or you are these random ...\nUm [noise] I Do have a picture of my mother has passed um I didn't included in the book because it felt a little too sacred to include that in the book or do you um but

more work like this story you know from the four oh five but I think is so I'm profound about that is\nAll the coordination collaboration that had happened on the other side in order for me to still be alive\nYou know my spirit guide you know talking to me and and I had to listen and believe\nToo not just Pam my friend who I who I Believe is actually her sister who is holding her down where she could not answer the phone or the other four people I called that you know their guides or their spirits are there ... somebody was distracting them not to pick up the phone\nAll\nWith the you know chance that I Would hear in less than that is pretty incredible when you think about it from the flip side\nDramatic yeah it is and as I I Believe that's happening every day all day all the time to millions and millions of people\nDoing that used to listen\nDon't you think it's pretty stark if you did not believe in the other side that that's all there is\nYeah I think it makes the world really

know the future how was that the spirit guide know that there was going to be an accident it happening in your future\n[noise] um I've thought about that and I've asked questions about that's a really

you you have you have different views right you know when you're in a body like us\nI'm a big dumb body you know we don't have that capability\nAnd I I I think what happened is the situation started becoming that which an accident was ready to happen right like he didn't tell me this news an hour before he told me sixty seconds before\nSo I don't think that everything is written you know 'cause there's free will there's all those great things that we have the power over but it's like everything all lined up and I think that when he saw it was going to happen\n\nAnd they're doing to protect us\nYes they are that's the important\nThey are there and you know spirit guy is a term I use other people like to use the the you know the the word angel you can use\nAlready named John gurney

I think when you do something like that it's a little more scientific than just having a cat or something that you think the big print but when you start looking at it in the scientific method it just

technology artificial intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age if I were in the long mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence is it that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I'll say this what what they're worried about was what we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on a simple\nA sufficient and that is that people are machines\nIf if you are a machine and your brain as a machine and your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an IQ of a hundred and two hundred the two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nAnd I said well what if your cyber all turns on you what if your calculator decides to turn on you then what if your smartphone does so the the question or will the machine turn on you know we see that in movies a lot right\nOh yeah and we ... we knew something called reasoning from fictional evidence which says will be seen so many times in movies maybe it would really happen\nBut we know these technologies can do an enormous amount of good they can they can feed the hungry and diagnose illness and do all of these things and I'm not sure that introducing an element of like it may turn on us uh\nThat that may be more that that may do is a lot more harm than than than good if it's ... it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because a single one was a transposed with the\nUh Oprah's transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air ... air\nAirplane full of people think you've got the co pilot right there you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack like that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one better they may break in big waves now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross and the ... and just really the incredible gross of this kind of technology\nYou know he he's at the humane\nThe main thing that feels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that were very interesting reason which was\nNewt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find out what the intelligence we didn't\nThat being said people get excited about a bunch of money came and everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took a nap for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up his face up to space up to space it's delivering the goods it can it if you out of business you can make public any department in your business than ten percent faster temperature better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advances and I ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is\nUh they they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode\nThat's a very rudimentary very rudimentary ah yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said um there's a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a peaks or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also stiffer gunpowder and\nYou know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to\nUm if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a ton of his killing systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budget sitter spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nUm could could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so uh it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're gonna for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a a weapon systems it's going to have it\nWell for for three very easy reasons you can argue that ah they're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are you then argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers\n... a ... and ... and whatever country you are and and and third you know they will they will work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost of going to war which uh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nAbsolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and that you know if if he has no cost\nA then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the day though by run that you know we're coming up to the top of the hour we'll finishes up when we come back next hour but you know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial cars with driverless cars do you see the day that uh you know all the entire\nPost office system will be done because

and Reese with us survivor and do you think technology will ever replace pulse to people who deliver the mail to our houses\n[noise] you know um I I had a I have a feeling that\nAny job at a machine can do\nWe really want machines to do it I mean 'cause if if the machine can do a job to make if you do that job there's a word for that that's called the humanizing mhm because if if you just use a person for staying in\nPoor machine then you're saying nothing about you that makes us human are we interested in really need you to be a machine that there'll be invented a is delivering the mail\nOr or building packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine washers windows I can imagine young machine that automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know\nBut but if you take a step back these technologies this country for two hundred and fifty years has ... has had unemployment between five and ten percent\nThe time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years half of the jobs vanish and so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years\nRight and we had rising wages\nAnd because so why are we able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out at everybody sees it and says I'm going to use this to increase my own productivity so whatever if you get self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city\nIf you are I mean like\nIt's hard it's hard necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if it went back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's gonna be this ... billion people are gonna use it what do you think it was going to do their jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were gonna vanish she would say well that's going to be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise]\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you wouldn't have seen at sea air B. and B. Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEverybody every time technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do\nA what a waiter can do you know they ... you you still a drink\nYou know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nDo you have a special order you want you want to send your food back there's something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone and an adult yeah\nSo well correct correct but it's proved very difficult\nLike right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nUh people are going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movements you're not going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your well out to run the wires it's just\nWay beyond you know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I Am happy when it gets that right when it doesn't get a an age and ate all mixed up so that's kind of wherever that um but like you said that you know yet\nUm and that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with\nPhysical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer\nAnd it may be that that you have to experience the world\nIn order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we have these mines are which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons\nBut people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project to try to take this little worm you got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to modeled on the computer just pick a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people who have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we're we're so spectacularly amazing\nAh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know of one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do and and we've used it to overcome scarcity because\nLaw of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff that we're in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate auction\nAnd what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a notch wars anymore 'cause 'cause\nWe could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor and the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies

of ability faster than we have grown our wisdom um\nBut that that cuts kind of out of the bag and so I I think you still ... live in a world where there's a billion people who are are hungry or you've got a lot of people who need to feed you still have the illness that\nKills everybody you start poverty which I think's a technical problem you have all these problems technology can solve why do I say that because\nThey don't have to be that there are there are lots of problems that aren't technical like there's hatred bigotry and all of that but there are certain things we just haven't figured out how old are you in disease how do you so down aging how do you do all of these things and so\nThey're suffering people around the world that just are waiting for technology to come through and\nAnd finally deliver on all the utopias people used to dream about whether it be great if and now finally we've learned district and we can now make enough of all the good stuff for everybody and

know pale blue dot\nIt's going to Ritchie in West Virginia now Ritchie taken away go ahead sir\nThe morning and thanks for having me on the shelves and say ... interesting topic I just wanted to ask your guest there if you think that the way technology is progressing that we may get to that your to your age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings as working alongside with technology\nI Love that question you know Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did go on a fault just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education vacation grow your own food make your own clothes you worked Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty are the people decided they wanted more and so there is no limit to human once it turns out so even in the future people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has\nSo we're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home but not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies\nBut it turns out we've always worked forty hours and we've if if if our productivity goes off we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm\nWith labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now Byron this technology\nUm\nI I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we will have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who to machine\nA fix\nI wrote probably couldn't\nMachine teach kindergarten probably not a ... we wanted to\nAnd so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\nYeah I guess than ... than ... than now and they can pay for it and and ... they're trying to take care of him and\nTell them that any human input and ... it gets half an hour with and now they're talking\nAbout automatic guns\n[noise] well I Know you're you're the guest a guard is entirely right\nUm we are using a columnist weapons we make decisions of course we've done that\nSince landmines we grow up with ... dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is rebuilding machines to kill a so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we don't machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to you don't make more dense systems that operate completely economists say that you can just\nReleased in an area and it will go and decided that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but bart I agree with you\nBefore the age aren't robots conscious computers in the

great stories about him or he just allowed me and to\nUm like the the theater where they record all the music and he said you stand here this is where the director stands and they you know if they stay here you get every beat and I'm like oh I Love this guy you got a great background by the way\nI have an end or are you talking about my elderly written Oklahoma talking about my day job\nYour

first and then made my way to San Francisco\nThen maybe the way down to Los Angeles\nAnd here you are and here I Am talking to you\nWriting stories about ghosts and interesting things\nRight and that the craziest title called their book that goes for target for\nWhat some of your peers about this the fact that I mean here you are you are a corporate executive doing some great work and now you're writing a story about the ghost photographer\n[noise] you know it's it's it's a great question I\nI think because what I Do day in day out is you know rooted and data\nAnd and I'm and I'm now ... you know within the organization thing in a very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories and they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you make this up\nHere that you're that nerd we wouldn't be [laughter]\nAnd and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people and have kind of gone with me on the journey and I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent\nAnd you know they they just they can't make their way over right to our nine that's right and\nBut I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could they interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realize you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they are afraid to tell a story because they're afraid that they're going to sound like a crazy\nWhich is one reason the actual on the right the book was so you know people could feel liberated to tell you have talked about their experiences 'cause\nIt's so many people what Adam and I also want it and I wanted to write it so people say well believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happening not yeah their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this and like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who has gone through the same thing they open up\nMy gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners and because I Am a nerd they've identified roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go ahead because I you know when that started happening to me and I didn't have a lot about it you know I did not\nYou stand on a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit about medium ship just you know some of the things in a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll\nUm that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and goes so we're almost the majority\nAttorneys were barely a minority and that's grown\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second stat um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and every two seconds\nTo say it again for everybody every two seconds\nSomeone in North America is doing the work is\nNot always saying yes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening\nUm but they can also now use some statistics to tell their friends hey I had a way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nHave nothing to hide\nAnd have nothing to hide ...\nJourney shortage for you because of a personal situation\nYes did you did\nThis started for me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey Adderall transformational Journey Through grief\nUm I lost my mother to all timers a and you know
