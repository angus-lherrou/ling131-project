new uh we were talking about the inventory cell and the dreams della right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward\nAnd in the dream still up a top most for says mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ... thinks\nOn his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show like on my news website over a coast to coast am it'll take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side the current neighbor is the one that is on the top now\nWith your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical but the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant\nWhich is is that some of the layers have a different sickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah [noise] um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid you\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the reviewer or who is is very well known a ... a shop here who don't we reviewed my paper\nOr he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by fitness petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but every once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker course\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see those points we peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base some of these peaks\nHave rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty three ... so you found that there are rounds fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for the interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total in in the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and ah originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed there was a they say that we're there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researcher who was proposed this is Robert ... brother John Paul evolve and the papers on I think it's on a Robert ... vaults or\nAcademia a page and it's also in cause me gloom uh his brother wrote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains the theory so there are some people that think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating the ticker layers\n[noise] um ...\nDoes it every ten steps is it every twelve is there some kind of ... you\nI that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately unfortunately no it's not that easy it's\nIt's kind of you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck me when I first saw that I was just struck white it\nThey do this or because you know you were you just you know simple minded the I thought that they were just a light the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian Egyptians designed if your image with something called they called it sit at which is a purely dangle\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how it conceptualize a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's little regularity even to the thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course\nNow I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do is spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen veteran decker yeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides\nYeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which Jimmy I wanted to correct something I said in a state to block interview I I think I said that uh the one to ... a shot a shot to ... and ... published at al ... was disappearing or during\nThe seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it was an arcade in a big dip her it was a star Iraq so it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country\nAnd because of that because that constellation ...\nThe girl is so important to chip shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big paper and we why the pyramid ended up in that in the north south uh orientation\nI gotta jump into right there

[noise]\n[noise]\nI Am I Am forty [noise]\nWelcome\nBack to the coast to coast am I ... church or guessing I'm Manu save Saturday and we're talking about his paper that was published last week and again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is a chi ops pyramid dot com the links are at coast to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you strike three hundred ... a a scrawled on page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers and with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber been descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up a which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this\nBut these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing moment you're right I'm I'm I'm a listing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three fellow these peaks or worse the civically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these route fractures tend to run\nA over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber and\nBased on this ... this observation that there seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know courses that have a surface area that is around a number of fracture of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid what we don't know of any spaces and work but nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that\nThere must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that ... ... exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to a proposed these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right well then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just going here one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nWhy so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... that the which has a surface area that is around fraction of twenty fifth Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... that\nAh that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course on the thirty four also has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nUh then the other courses don't don't have round ... twenty fifth and they're not associated with ceilings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nUh and that goes across the feeling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and ten twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers in fact the tower\nUm and and then the final point I Want to make is that the possible avoid which are marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be real eighty four\nNo roe eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are at the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this scandal that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the hope that the void\nI got it yes yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly which is it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give up off guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy yeah and and he says to a dismal news see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion at go Beckley tabby and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and it's a relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things thrown dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land a

I think he is actually involve a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved or at least not maybe not publicly but ... thinks he's involved the opposite force at by a if you put\n'em you know I think they're sort of a mixed bag here you know there is the public's eye ... you know I was on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientists archeologists loved what he does\nUm you know it's difficult to kind of sort it all out but I think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research done and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects\nThat uh you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being safe in political right now and I I understand that I knew it and I respect that yeah but there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from ... stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that is why are they gonna have to open right are are they going to have to back pedal yeah\nSo it to the to the listener's question I think I forgot than it was that and you I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you you said to talk of and so I think that has something has changed uh they're sort of a you know people are even each opposes that talked to some of some of the scholars local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA Fayette they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGonna be jumping right there I knew I got to take a

time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website\nAnd one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino and do you notice is are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTrade meaning\nThat's just what it says in the winter\nWe don't know yeah um I I\nAssume there would be a couple of things that do you knows referencing here one would be size and orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological uh within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched a documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea when we look at the the tops\nOf the the the\nPyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes\nThat the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is and what do not not the top top two there'd be a chamber or something and the have the upper levels\nYet as well I think so I think that could be that there could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before it's on a\nDrop off ... has proposed that the summit of the great pyramid was not a peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of this year is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory or in others have proposed similar things there's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it's not up to your media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it um\nNow you've got to anomalies in a ... and and one is clearly defined ad row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI acting so how big would it be the way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by ... Hi I'm saying right you know maybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stacked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph guns and bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that ah who Don and buyer investigated it's up on the south it's on the north east side\nOf the northeast corner right in the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers they made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to form these ... studies it seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the blades throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like this\nAnd the excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the place\nAnd then you know you have to pay the people to experiment I'm guessing multiple million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that you do this project um and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you just repeat studies\nUm but I I think if you do any kind of in a fish a project or the project like this you're spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and hope things\nA kind of money that will need for a project like\nThis is coast to coast am host she'll

all of his papers over on his website ... pyramids a dot com and the links to that are over ed coast to coast am now\nMy new before we get back to the calls I have talked to you before and I mentioned this in my opening\nLittle rant here tonight on coast to coast which is and knees you we seem to have amnesia\nAnd it's all over the place but\nIt's it's ... it's not represented any more plainly than what happened in Egypt after Cleopatra and\nWe had that ah example of it but it was going on for a year she was the last pharaoh in Egypt before she committed suicide the amnesia had already set in and what we need to and you mentioned this uh last week on my other show fade to black\nWhich is this that Cleopatra\nIs nearer to us than she is to ancient Egypt there's three thousand years there there's only two thousand years I'm On this side\nOf of Cleopatra and that's an insane amount of time we don't really understand how old the Egypt is until you look at it in those terms right\nRight and then going back to go back to accept the and the time when we think the original thinks was built then you double that entire time period one more time and more\nWhy is it that we we are so quickly to forget the past\nWell I think because a ... a crime and cook a Robert shock I'm Robert Duvall and other office um you know have proposed that there was a catastrophe on earth and it wiped out or the evidence of\nThis uh these earlier people and uh the only thing that survive or if I'm about these monuments\nUm and so uh I think that's probably why we've forgotten I I always remember this great movie planet of the apes the original one which is a you know when he lands on the planet that you think is another planet but it's actually earth\nAnd then you know at the end of the movie he finds out the hard way that ah that this earth has an Asia and the UC the statue of liberty bird in the sand and I just had such a profound impact on me that movie\nUm and I think that's sort of maybe that's the story that we're living in in reality\nLet's let's head back to the phones it's been an incredible night here with a with the audience and\nThey they are just as interested in finding

I'm Sorry it was the question again he's he's asking if the pyramid is actually the tip of the iceberg\nAh okay that's a great question so I'm\nA you know one way to marry the the the theory of a lot civilization starting something ... and then the old kingdom\nAre Egyptians of a you know building on top of it is basically to draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro is your name right yes\nSo um yeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look\nOn on the pyramid itself on the ... on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and you know what that is bad walk that's not humor in stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded to sort of\nYou know allow for stores to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact\nRobert Duvall has in senior ate it is that he things that maybe there were strains on the in the three locations and they were lying to you know the belt stars of a Ryan a dating to step peppy\nAnd then you know in the old kingdom are Egyptians came they basically built their pyramids on top of the shrines\nAnd so uh and the ... so what's under the pyramid also you know the subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks\nMuch older and when you walk into the red pyramid or you walk into the what's called the kings chamber\nThere's also a you feel like you are you are basically in a new phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on top so it's an excellent question um proving it is a little bit difficult of course but uh it's definitely something that's possible\nThank you so much Manu\nJust an absolutely perfect fascinating conversation tonight here on coast yeah I loved\nIt so much to me we've got a twenty seconds left what's next for you\n[noise] um what are your ... one of your listeners out exactly the right question about the connection between Quebec they kept the and in Egypt and that's what's next\nAnd there's no doubt that there's a connection I there's a seven thousand year gap in there and we're going to fill it in and ... with your help thank you so much Manu they safe out there\nWhat a conversation tonight this is what coast to coast is all about for me is being able to come in here and discuss my favorite thing which is loss history and Egypt well of course time travel ghost UFOs all of that stuff counts too but for me it is Egypt and loss history\nAnd with that I got to get out of here\nSo I don't see everybody here in a couple of weeks but before I Do that I've got to think Nathan for running the board of course Donald behind the glass\nChris for being the producer for me here lax Greg Tim Lisa Stephanie George and my beautiful wife Rita with that I Am your host Jimmy church spent coast to coast am I'm signing off go back to lead tabby\nAttention investors diversified to real estate for returns of twenty\nPercent with monthly pass tax advantages had\nOne hundred percent of cash flow paid to investors\nFirst national realty as a proven eleven year track record eight hundred million dollars a realty under management tend to new two hundred million dollar portfolio closing now backing your investment or IRA with multiple cash flowing New York city apartment buildings luxury condos with Hoboken New Jersey water view spent Delray Beach Florida ocean front town homes you were backed by prime\nReal estate these are ... free information you were backed by heart assets in New York Hoboken Philadelphia and Delray Beach gulfstream Florida called two oh one to ten twenty seven twenty seven for these twenty percent return real estate back units for your IRA or cash flow call now two oh one to ten twenty seven twenty seven two oh one to ten twenty seven twenty seven that offer\nTo buy or sell any securities only made by their private placement memory and read it first in the best ways we past performance is no guarantee of future results national as a real estate developer see them in an R.

the inventory Stella and the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward\nAnd in the dream Stella a top most the fourth says mentions and and illustrates two ... thinks is there\nUh without uh destroying the monuments or without hurting them I think that's the right way to go so yes I was I was amazed but what's it MySpace or the question of how can you how can you know without a eventually going in there\nThe pay per that minute published last week is on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show\nLike on my news website over a coast to coast to I'm going to take your street there there are a list of papers on the right hand side the current paper is the one that is on the town\nNow with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant which is is that some of the layers have a different sickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review or a who is it is very well known a job for a job here who don't we were my paper\nOr he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by plane as petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but every once in a while there is a jump so you have a much thicker course\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's ... peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface or at the base some of these peaks\n... rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so you found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for the interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story Great Pyramid how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and ten\nA originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have to\nHave to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed that was that they say there was there was a virtual top so it was actually flat at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know one of the the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... brother ... and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths a\nAcademia a page and it's also in Cosby gloom uh his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains the theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and of course other people say it was and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the uh repeating of the thicker layers\n[noise] um\nIs it every ten steps is it every twelve is there's some kind of ...\nI that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of what you know to me it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I\nI'm I was just struck by when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you were you could just you know simple in mind that I thought each step they were just a applied the ah the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed their appearance with or something called they called ... which is the purely angle\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how they conceptualize a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and ah and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's little regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that uh after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen veteran decker yeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides\nYeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension yeah\nWhich which Jimmy I wanted to correct something I said in the fate to block interview I I think I said that uh the ... to ... um shot a shop to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it was an arcade in a big dip her it was a star Iraq so it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation big tipper was so important to Egypt shows\nThat the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big tipper and why the pyramid ended up in that in the north south uh orientation\nI got a jumping right there this is coast to coast and

that was published last week\nAnd again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is a Chiapas pyramid dot com\nThe links are at coast to coast am and go to the right side scroll down there's a list of publish papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you strike three hundred ... a a scrawled on page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers and with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up a which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this\nBut these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing bowl and you're right I'm I'm On this thing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three fellow these peaks a war specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were round number fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these route fractious tend to run a over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have\nThere seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this this observation that the it seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know courses that have a surface area that is around a number of facts of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and work but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that in fact that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yet you need to have if you are going to a proposed these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right well then you have to have some basis for this and clearly\nWe have a I I'm just looking at one two three four five six seven eight absolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example correspond a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface area that is around fraction of twenty fifth Nineteen twenty fifth that\nAligns with the uh the uh you know the ... that ah that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the ...\nOr so in other words if a soldier with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course on the twenty four also has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the feeling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round facts of twenty fifth and they're not associated with the ring so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nUh and that goes across the feeling of the um off the ground at power\nUm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and ten twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers in fact the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which are marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo roe eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly I\nYeah you are at the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this and that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the hope that the boys\nI got it yes yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly which is it's kind of a the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give up off guard\nI Want to jump back uh\nReally quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from ...\nYeah and and he says to a ... minute see any connection between a dynastic Egyptian use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion at go Beckley tabby and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the uh cataclysmic events the end of the ice age the construction

you\nKnow with this references of course with the lines too as well extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet\nI'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a ...

don't want to cover it up all with you know modern reconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do affection\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched\nSo that's

other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and stuff you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you think that

pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the kings of the old king them I think\nThe first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it's middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appears and that's all I Know about it offhand\nI read I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here a bummer when we're going back\nTo um men as\nA um and\nIn the first and I'm going to say the word they referred to as kings\nYeah right right\nLike ... and men is uh the first uh teams of Egypt could be some are saying\nThe same a menace unarm are may be the same or they could be two different teams they weren't
