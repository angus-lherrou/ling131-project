C. P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company\nWhere his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of\nSecurity Donald Rumsfeld military ... group and his brand new book is called an alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times\nFinally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly uh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty\nDesigned to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place in Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I enough treaty because they have\nA not only build but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that we've tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine or that has um\nYou know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because there's a concern to solve it you know that has cut back dramatically\nA nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threats posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok\nTwenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states well\nIt does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly headed commission on military technology um that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a\nFighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states\nYou know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War when President Reagan had essentially vanquished\nUh when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their their passions for free for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who we would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic\nOf Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nUh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down\nCame to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give him a few crimes we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir putting\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nAn employee with the city of Santa Monica has been arrested for molesting children\n... and public safety systems analyst for the city of Santa Monica is IT department and he volunteered with the city's police activities\nLead it's an

the air and then she suddenly caught sight of a UFO\nShe was clearly amazed by what she was seeing Fernandez quickly pointed out the anomaly to her co host Diego and uh and jelly and the odd object appears to be a silver sphere and they quickly moved across the sky and eventually vanishes when from site when it flies off screen\nWhile we're unable to discern exactly what the anchors are saying it seems clear that Fernandez was stunned by the oddities rapid speed that said one local account of the incident indicates that the duo may not have taken the citing all that seriously has the

satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put us\nSpace station up very shortly now they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're we're talking about I'm beginning to do well there are rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nThe president and the Pentagon\nAnd wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as a true competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's all these other areas that\nShow national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information or appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and is helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they\nCan monitor your own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing a bi oh they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet I'm that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising\nChinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there\nUm and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have a leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I ... to the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder ... with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these from\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nLast few um about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states uh to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm and how that might\nI mean there's there are dominoes at play here obviously\nI'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed ah with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his to Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that their cars so sugary situation is is tragic\nBut if you've been watching Mohammed than psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nThe so called ... and the the desert which uh he was expecting all these uh donors and investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so they can develop a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms that of course now they could go to the Chinese are Russians but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nAnd and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a cry for with then of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians in Chinese or a lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm there were ... they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west where not all excited about uh but the reality is that um\nYou know a friend of my ... you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is it you know my friend or something like that that the idea being that we we have to have partners in that part of the world it's a dangerous\nA game that the airplane we see that evolved over the years in Iraq we see it in Syria you know even you know ... and I would just welcome\nPresident how the sea of Egypt up into Moscow for his fourth visit in the last couple of years and you know they made big arms deals and they're talking nuclear power plant in ... a vote these sorts of issues are on the forefront if we abandon the Saudis now\nUm you know they will run into the arms of putting input and understand that a or into the arms of chi and\nTo a certain degree that's happening I'm you know we have to recognize the dark side of the world very bad things happen uh our our own government has been involved over the you know decades and very bad things we don't publicize like\nBob ... the interruption

affiliate in depth radio news talk ten ten lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis days with is the book is a lines of evil Russia China the United states\nAnd a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived\nThere had been a all obviously some older patients with the Russians are particularly\nUm uh well I wouldn't call them Russian regular troops these are more like mercenaries in Syria the United states has certainly encountered were had heated battles with them or there have been some near collisions in the south China Sea was Chinese vessels how do you see this\nOr what is the the danger of this breaking out into all out war and perhaps as you point out morphing into the unfathomable uh the end and end times scenario\nWell certainly the confrontations or on the uptick current Richard you know we had one here recently with the USS are done Decatur a destroyer\nOr in the grave and reefs in the south China Sea or the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos set it flew over um you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these pilots uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here to fence weapons and [noise]\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from\nThat these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase uh we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air as I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to Ford station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we killed a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we call them and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent a the Assad regime a and of course uh the Russians wife their hands of even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario uh is is is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the Gaga mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president of the sea of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air the one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a seeks to be the collie and\nTo establish a cow fat and his statements have been\nVery very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but you know the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently ah was after great pressure we put on him a air do on a to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA any consistently has had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he is a new Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so\nThat these are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who are of course uh even though there are some friction there they are working together\nAnd of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our allies\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese yes are beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here a confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to one and and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know it's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her ... her to one didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops to see who was up to the Gulf and to uh Kuwait\nUm air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the F for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late a they even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ...\nThe Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to Iran and on the coastline there then you can begin\nPlutonium and that put\nYou on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants to alternately\nWell it's just too rich so the the the turkey is buying um air defense systems that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO offensively used to protect NATO from Russian missile\nYes and that yeah because we will not connect our patriots and other fads to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why yeah there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course are there others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk practice secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islam ec viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nAnd the autocratic rule view of of the removal of when I I think that you find that they're not involved with the Hutus are not involved with a thought ah they're less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia yeah Riyadh and Iran is going to continue um but it ... if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging him off and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a uranium through wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and\nThey have a long history I Would hope that they will replace their autocratic with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another followed from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the ... were sort of seen as a counter measure to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects and in Saudi Arabia is well here's van Morrison taking us into the break with a band low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant colonel

child is young there's no place they could run into a because it's if it's parents abuse and there's a ... and there are circumstances where they live on the most horrendous ... a\nCircumstance is yes it is a tragedy to begin with ... yet what we're learning what were overcoming and that's the whole key here\nIs to overcome those abuses and also it's for the parents if it's apparent abuse or other types of abuse they have the opportunity to overcome that as well and usually if it's a long term relationship they might have agreed to do that both of them\nThat this is the role that they will take\nAnd it's up to those two people to come to some kind of resolution of their behavior that they have to rise above that particular pattern so we can see the negative of it but there are cases where people rise above themselves and they become a heat wave and their own life\nOf the person that they may have been they've been abusing they may educate them somehow so there's always hope here and yes we do have guys and angels that do help us\nIt is up that we is up to the individual to draw upon that help we need to call on that help our angels in guys\nAll right Joe thank you for that a

has the mystery of the end times\nFinally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you I'm doing well Richard thank you for having me feeding\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly are pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty\nDesigned to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians or suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I enough treaty because they have\nA not only build the practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that\nWe've tractor cruise missile we call the nine and seven to nine or that has um you know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of the twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow 'cause it it should concern to solve it\nYou know that his cutting back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want to also dial back to September when Russia began his largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly headed commission on military technology that is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the cold\nWar when President Reagan had essentially vanquished uh when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and\nThen later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their\nTheir passions for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who we would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders and Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call them the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from\nThe republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nUh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down\nCame to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise] we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crimes we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir potent\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nA nationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nWhich ocean and drinking water pollution coming in second and third California

shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we uh\nThe United states we're we're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon\nAnd wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as a true competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's all these other areas that\nShow national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that

Pentagon on you know those types of things um uses the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing ah you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising\nChinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of at a country you\nKnow they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere

affiliate in depth radio news talk ten ten lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis stays with us the book is a lines of evil Russia China the United states\nAnd a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived\nThere had been a I'll obviously some older patients with the Russians are particularly\nUm um well I wouldn't call them Russian regular troops these are more like mercenaries in Syria the United states has certainly encountered were had heated battles with them or there have been some near collisions in the south China Sea was Chinese vessels how do you see this\nOr what is the the danger of this breaking out into all out war and perhaps as you point out morphing into the unfathomable uh the end and then times scenario\nWell certainly the confrontations or on the uptick current Richard you know we had one here recently with the USS a Decatur of destroyer\nA in the grave and reefs and the south China Sea the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it\nAnd just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos flew over um you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here to fence weapons and [noise]\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from\nThat these are claimed by the Vietnamese Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase uh we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air as I indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we kill a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we call them and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent a the Assad regime a and of course uh the Russians wife their hands of even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any end times scenario uh is is is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking uh the the Gaga mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's\nInteresting a friend of mine spoke with a a general now president of the sea of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that\nTo one who is the current president of turkey is really a seeks to be the collie and to establish a cow fat and his statements have been very very um\nConducive to that interpretation not only within the region but\nYou know the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently\nAh was after great pressure we put on him a air do on a to cooperate with us but yet we find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there\nYeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA any consistently has had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so\nThese are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching have collaborating with Russians who are of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nAnd of course they're working against ah the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our lives\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria hoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so\nA lot of players here a confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to one and and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know a fair question I don't think so um my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through Mosul to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her ... her to one didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops through the Suez up through the Gulf into Kuwait um\nOn as not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the F for hundreds of surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or maybe even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ... from the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to Iran\nAnd on the coastline there then you can begin to make a\nPlutonium and that put you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants to Austin in like\n... it's just too rich so the the the turkey is buying um air defense systems that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO extensively used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that yeah because we will not connect our patriots and other fads to a Russian as four hundred a that's why there's a it's a non ... we just won't do it\nUh and that is a major bone of contention and of course there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk practice secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islam ec viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging him off and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that have a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the ... were sort of seen as a counter measure to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects and in Saudi Arabia's well here's ... van Morrison taking is into the break with a band

national health service that overall this study provides no evidence to support the existence of an afterlife merely that people near death may still have memorable experience\nIs\nA common thread
