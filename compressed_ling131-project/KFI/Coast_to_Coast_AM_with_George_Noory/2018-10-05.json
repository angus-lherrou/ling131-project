whether you're telling people to sneak in on the air yeah forget it\nYou know take forget money involved were going to take it you know taste from the mayor de and the doorman I think we all have to have that conversation with him uh about two o'clock tomorrow in ... after ... okay well if we get there yeah we get there early enough on Saturday we can have a conversation set up the parameters you know who gets well actually you know what we need we need a third degree of\nSo obviously the Democrats want to hold up the nomination and the confirmation until after the election they're hoping they can get the Senate mhm and reverse sort of the process of the court moving to Republican tax\nThe reality is instead of deciding to use the truth to to to get Kavanaugh killed they decided to use that which is entertaining\nAnd in the process the violations of due process are just breathtaking when you really feel like from a legal standpoint you're watching the Spanish Inquisition you know in a minor in the big scary thing here\nIs that the population is than being weaponized they're being encouraged to just ignore it due process\nYou know and treat the people involved like the metaphors\nAnd and ... and not based on the law are due process but just on sort of emotional mob being and that's scary because that kind of weaponization of the population can take a very and places you know I had to Lindsey Graham had a ramp during the\nHearing I thought oh my God I'm agreeing with Lindsey Graham is truly frightening [laughter] they you know he basically said he turned to the Democrats and he said you you better not get power because he can't handle it\nSo you know it's pretty scary and I I Will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population and increasingly allowed them to those it'd be weaponized so you know the reality is is is you know these people are not metaphors they're individuals and you have to judge them according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where does this come out I think the capital is going to be confirmed\nAnd ... if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderates pulled out its because if you you know if you do a deep dive into his record\nWhat it says he's he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment and the constitution so I think he's apt to bend the law to help the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go\nAnd that's what's going to get some of the moderates you know problems and so that might get he he's going to be confirmed probably this weekend and what's interesting about this is the impact that will have on the election\nUm and I think one of the things it's done is it's really galvanized the Republican base because there\nAre you know two weeks ago they were concerned about Trump's personality now you know and it tweeting now they're not they're concerned about what would happen is that um you know if the Democrats had the leadership position\nDo we do we all loses people because of all of this\nAny any time any one of the things talk act supports the violation of due process\nUm we we put our whole culture and our whole system in jeopardy and the whole our whole financial markets in jeopardy\nSo you know I think this is we each have a responsibility under the constitution the law to to protect the law and I'll tell you something you know I went through an eleven year highly lawless process where I was targeted and and you know efforts by government people to frame E. mhm and what\nWould have me George was that I literally you know I went to the process and safe\nAnd what happened was there were so many people inside the FBI or the department of justice or the different agencies involved or my attorneys for the general population who really believed in the law and it was their belief in the law that ultimately saved me\nSo we need to believe in it it's every one of us and um you know I think I think that a lot of the people uh you know who is allowed themselves to be weaponized oh oh ah\nOh an apology to to everybody involved or everybody had to give testimony and I certainly think the leadership of the Congress as American apology\nWe shall see how this all unfold caverns website so Larry SOL A.

it was the ... anniversary of the law that we would actually have spoof show in the theater and so we had a you know I uh we basically have swam me bring Bela Lugosi back to life and then we had a\nUh the people dressed as goes so flying through the audience and touching people and and uh\nUh we had um a you know all kinds of the gimmicks the nurses in attendance and uh you know prize giveaways and I'm a ... a lot of corny stuff uh but those shows used to for a while they were traveled\nAnd it pretty much was the birth of the midnight movie because you know the the theaters didn't want to give up their eight o'clock movie or the ten o'clock movie\nAnd so um you know the the the people who are four walling they would they would buy the theater out you know they would they would show up in town with a film under their arm a scary movie and they they they would rent the theater out\nA after hours and they would show these are shows mainly for teenagers are usually teenagers who wanted an a and sometimes rowdy ah rowdy teenagers too\nAnd sometimes they didn't have matinees for kids to 'em but then they would they have these amazing blackouts where they turn the lights out and they would have luminous and goes made out of a mosque that were ... phosphorus and [laughter]\nThey would they would uh you know they would have these chains that would be wrapped through the bleachers and they would react with them back and forth and it would make all the chairs vibrate and they'd all these great uh you know that they would put the they were put weird the strings and ice water and\nThrow them out in the audience and they go down to the back of people shirts and people will be feeling this cold\nGoing down the back of their shirt you know um there was so many fun kind of carnival type gimmicks that these guys did and they would go from town to town town and sometimes the\nThree movies back back um with all these great gimmicks there'd be a magician sideshow act you know people putting nail through their nose and all that stuff\n[noise] what's the appeal of the Rocky Horror picture show remember that\nI firmly absolutely I think that that did have an audience participation aspect to it you know when when they have the host everyone throws a piece of toast at the screen\nOr people have call and response where they're yelling things up at the screen or you know their wife prone during the wedding and I think it's an immersive experience but I also because of the sexuality of the film you know people who are sixteen Seventeen years old and are kind of emerging into their adult life\nIt's kind of a ... thing that they can go into with their friends and you know they might uh\nAccidentally see a little scanner so [laughter] so I think that all that factored in and and you have a you\nKnow people who who met met each other a sixteen year old a Rocky Horror and ended up getting married as adults and I've heard as I think that that I've seen the shadow cast in the age or a performance that goes along with the movie perform and very very different markets all over the country\nAnd over and over again I flew people who were met that show and gotten married so I don't know what it is about that but you definitely find your people if you if you really are into that\nHouston, Texas we go Robert's with us on coast to coast hey Robert go ahead

called Black Christmas or something like that\nThat was Black Christmas a with a that was a Bob Clark who went on to direct a Christmas Story but why Christmas uh there was a a a killer that was terrorizing sorority sisters who all lived in the same house\nAnd she he was calling them from inside the house\nOh wow that's what a repeat that's creepy\nUh and uh but uh there was also yeah it's it's a very creepy film or we well made structured horror film John facts and it's amazing in it and it's um a template for a lot of those kind of movies from the seventies\nAnd like I said that guy went on to make quirky you went on to make a Christmas Story or a lot a lot of other films and different genres\nBut somebody will some of these movies Mr ... are are creepy they're not pure horror

cutting edge how did you end up doing what you're doing how did that I [noise] well it started\nWhen I was a rebellious kid in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world but had no way to do that and uh I had a couple of experiences started with uh being somewhere I shouldn't have been with somebody I shouldn't have been with\nA closing time in the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit by a drunk driver all through my body off the motorcycle and\nUm I had a real physical tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and I think there was something in that moment that suggested anyway that consciousness is more than just our physical bean\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I laid there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware of the tangles up my\nLeg ... you know now I have two sturdy legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience near death experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my cute pink Japanese and being a good and pure assist which means you investigate everything\nYou have those little feet pajamas\nI think so I don't really remember but I've heard tales\nAnd ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on a kitchen table and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense\nDrink I drink it and it\nCauses massive pneumonia and\nI almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand\nConsciousness somebody once you were wrong\nI guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raised there and left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember in town now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then the marsh first places I was in tumor Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis a Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between shambles in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference\nThere family still there I have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my modus motorcycle accident while you're born heights really yeah well he\nTold me where cars you must remember this the the street\nOh I don't I don't know who\nWas ... was it a busy street\nYeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over\nAre we going to I'm gonna I'm gonna close my eyes and yes you'll remote viewing now that you were on telegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear Michigan in viewing skill near Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its roots in your backyard my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach\n... really steer you in the direction where you are now I mean you've got a PHD and social lives were apology you've just been elected a vice president of the psychological ... will get into that but this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which will remember\nI Do and what time of course the Detroit uh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown yeah um well I discovered\nTo books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Kuhn book called the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view a kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen astronaut\nBreak and\nI didn't apply for the job at no attic sciences but it was about ... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe ... university no\nThat's right we're looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of notion\nThat there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right\nIt is and he really really well you know it\nComes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually strollers brewery what she'll remember\nRemember the Troy lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nDo they do they still college which beer\nYou know I don't know I haven't really uh gobbled up it's been a natural Hampshire\nRight over micro breweries have taken over\nWhat what have you know what have you learned about near death experiences above the other side what to do what can you conclude at this point well\nI Know that culture\nTakes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment that the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and paste\nA son that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nAnd if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intention is very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve\nIf something you know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nRight I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was that document tests were the people who really understood and new and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of these things that they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than the bunker\nI think so too and it's a ... I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism is the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulse\nYou got to Maryland to stay with us we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work\nIn our final our next hour we'll take phone calls about this but I also want you when we come back to talk about the story of reincarnation about a little child that was born with three ... of march\nAnd we'll talk about that it's an amazing story so many more Dr Merrill Lynch Schlitz with us or website is her name and we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com that makes it really easy [noise]\nFree zone email newsletters out six days a week and it's a great way to keep up on all things coast\nWe detailed program recaps the fascinating today in St Louis upcoming info and weekly re audio quips it's a must have caused famines re sign up on the coast to coast am dot com home page [noise]\nWhen it breaks [noise]\nI'm Michael procedure live from the KFI twenty four hour news rumor former LAPD cop who says he was abused by a priest has sued the Vatican for the release of all documents relating to the sex abuse scandal many Vegas as he was abused as a ten year old and he should we need to bring out the truth worldwide\nApologies still protect kids action does promises don't protect kids action does pledges don't protect kids action does\nVegas lawyers say the lawsuit is the first\nOf its kind against the Vatican's suit uses a law which allows a foreign country to be sued for damages committed on us soil public health officials in LA county see downtown LA has been hit with an outbreak of type ... which is red to people by infected fleas that this was a the police do not pass the disease to pets or other animals just people\nAnd people cannot pass it to each other\nType of skin cause high fever chills headache and rash it can be treated with antibiotics they head of the Senate Judiciary committee says there's no hint of misconduct in the new FBI\nReport on judge ...

psychology called terra management theory\nThat was developed out of the work of Ernest backer who wrote that great book a denial of death\nAnd they have found that if people are you know functioning in a in a normal way and they get triggered by some reminder of their mortality it can lead to very pathological types of behaviors\nBut if you can bolster their sense of\nA personal worth their ... their value in the world and you you enhanced their self esteem\nYou'll see that when you trigger them they actually become more optimistic they care about other people so I think if we can approach this idea of death and the great mystery of it with an open heart and that kind of skepticism that is productive\nI I think can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no did you did you know he'll gr Mitchell before he passed on\nYeah very well regarded worked with him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with him for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find [laughter]\nUm but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important to live a good life and to be a good citizen\nI'm to be loving inclined toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nUsed their descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death if you were ... ... ... knew this was challenged ducts which challenged could you prove that there's life after death\n[noise] so this would make a great reality show your love Ina courtroom let's do it [laughter]\nSo you have a judge and a jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWith witnesses the common goal\nExactly giving their own um personal testimony based on their experiences\n... put it right here\nAnd then you get into this question of what would shift people's\nMind about that question\nAnd is it the data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch much were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it plays that role but it plays with all of what would you first of all shapes consciousness\nWell I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world of you and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that shapes her experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectations\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them\nAnd I think that that is a remarkable uh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of a functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers us a point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that\nThe consciousness live just outside of the brain\nAnd I think consciousness is something that has intelligent it is self correcting it is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in poor because\nEvery ... is filled with light and when that intention\nTo manage life and so I I Do believe that consciousness or something much bigger than our individual brain\nI don't think it's an ... found that out of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed\nThe conscious or the signal or the signal exactly\nKeeps coming ... exactly you will will science ever meet the spiritual side of all of this\nSo I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I guess at a time when the the uh the Android she's a robot\nYeah Hartford advised her yeah it'd be great for you to

even your storage scale give us some of your favorites you have like tour films since you were a kid haven't you\nWell actually and and and briefly let me just say that William Castle wanted to direct a Rosemary's Baby but he had such a reputation gimmicky movies that they didn't let them do but yet when I was\nA I was terrified of these I mean I I was like in my Spiderman pajamas a you know just sweating under the coffee table\n... year I'd have to go into the other room I was a kid when skipper we yell at Gilligan you're in you're looking to Ireland I Would have to get out of the real you know it was a little too little too hot when skipper with yoga and whether it's you know\nYou know I think they're having a hard time uh I'm\nHolding on to a viewing audience I think that honestly I think we I think that the young women I think are probably but target because you know we've lost all the boys to video games and I and the women the women aren't far behind [laughter]\nBut I think demographic wise you know we're going with stereotype\nYou know I think I think women spend the money so I think that a lot of horror film I think ... has kind of been made and even with this move or a or with this new Halloween movie Jamie Lee Curtis is the hero she's she's going to kill a Michael Meyers when she gets a hold of them she ... she was praying for him to speak that as being asylum so she could blow it brings out\nAnd I think that having heroic women in these movies that evening star wars you know and now the doctor who was a woman I think that you know it's a it's a ... it's a these are women are still spending their money on media physical media on movies and\nThey're they're controlling that dollar and I think we're going to see a lot of horror and five five films with strong female will\nThrow throw out some percentages I'm going to give you some age brackets here among those who are Fifteen Years old to twenty what percent of them do you think go to movies\n[noise] probably none [laughter]\nNot really [laughter] the end of twenty Fifteen to Twenty years old yeah I I I Would I Would say forty percent about ... twenty to thirty\nTwenty to thirty I Would say uh I Would maybe I maybe I skew that little higher maybe maybe fifty percent thirty to forty per se is usually [noise]\nThirty to forty I Would say I would say larger I Would I Would guess maybe sixty five\nReally okay now I think it starts coming down forty to fifty years old\nForty to fifty years old I think it yeah I think it would really come down I Would think the baby baby a twenty percent\nFifty to sixty\nAnd I would probably even less and I don't know maybe the fifth year old might be hanging in there but I think maybe the six year old son and beyond are probably a much much more likely to um enjoy a film in their home and the trouble was going to a theater\nOne of the things we'll do just for fun next hour when we take calls for you is we'll ask the callers if they want to share their age it's up to them\nAnd bone on well and whether they go to movies or not I can't remember the last movie I went to I mean I\nI look at a lot at home on video I ... when you know they come out as a news new release or something I'll watch it um but I I Can't remember the last time I was in an actual really I\nDo enjoy I Do enjoy seeing a film in the theater with an audience but a lot of time\nOn that you ... and that's your ... your business\nSo I I I'm I'm I'm biased because I'm watching the audience I\nThat's what you do so that's one of the things we'll do folks who'd

amputated my leg and I laid there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware of the tangles up my\nLeg you know now I have two sturdy legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience near death experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my ... and being a good NPR assist which means you investigate everything\nYou have those little feet pajamas\nI think so I don't really remember them on it but I've heard tales\nAnd ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on the kitchen table and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense drink\nI drink it and it causes you know massive pneumonia and almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand consciousness\nSomebody once you were wrong\nAnd I guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raise their left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember until now so tell me where was that I was\nBorn in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then um my first places I was until you were Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot in the style Jeff for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference\nThere family still there I have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my motor motorcycle accident airborne heights really yeah well you\nTell me where cars you must remember the the the street oh I Know\nI was ... was it a busy street\nYeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over\nAre we going to I'm gonna I'm gonna close my eyes and yes\nYou'll remote viewing now that you were on telegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear miss viewing skill near Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its roots in your backyard my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I appreciate ...\nReally steer you in the direction where you are now um and you get a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected vice president of the psychological ... will get into that but this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember I Do and\nWhat time of course the Detroit\nA good one oh really so that is right downtown yeah um well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Kuhn book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a worldview kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history and that was a big empowerment\nFor me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen\nAstronaut regard and I didn't apply for the job at no at sciences but it was about ... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe ... university no\nThat's right we're looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in Georgia it's all that\nKind of notion that there\nAre aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right\nIt is and he really really well it's you know it\nComes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually strollers brewery which you'll remember\nRemember the Troy lists\nAnd so\nThe beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nDo they do they still call it ... you know I don't know I haven't really uh gobbled up it's been a yes or Hampshire\nRight over micro breweries have taken over\nWhat would it be you know what have you learned about\nNear death experiences above the other side what do you what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture\nTakes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment that the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and paste\nA son that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nAnd that if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intention is a very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to and you know make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nIncarnation about a little child that was born with three ... of march and we'll talk about that it's an amazing story so many more Dr Merrill Lynch lived with us or website is her name and we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com that makes it really easy\n[noise] [noise] when it breaks [noise]\nI'm Michael ... live from the camp by twenty four hour newsroom demand upstart death row records has been sentenced to twenty eight years in prison for killing a man with his truck in Compton one daughter of the main killed told the court yesterday that what ... did was senseless\nMy dad and my father God [noise] but\nThe adequate picture to grown by\nNight pleaded no contest last month the voluntary manslaughter for the twenty Fifteen incident which happened after an argument on the set of the movie straight ...
