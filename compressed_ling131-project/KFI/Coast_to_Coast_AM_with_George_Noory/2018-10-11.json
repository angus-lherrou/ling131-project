never be pictured with alcohol and your hands and never swear but I'll be mad but I said but I picked up the Bud Light and said this but this is a big ...\n[laughter] and I didn't know it was live on

have the greatest coastline the greatest agriculture and the the uh funniest most creative people in Hollywood and yet as a state with all those things even with high taxes and stuff were broke is not by the state\nHas nine billion dollar surplus which is part of what I said spend that on us again either give us a tax break in reducing the tax right give us some money for homelessness which we did get this year\nUm but they created nine ... well they have a nine billion dollar surplus we created so the state actually finding and credit to Governor Brown he balanced budgets and socket away\nUm but I don't I think in some ways they were almost too greedy with that money when we have things like homelessness on our streets and the state really had been missing in action until this year so the\nPensions are going to catch up to us I mean you got your budget in Los Angeles I but what was the ... century form as it is a\nBig piece when I was council president so we we actually had our employees now I'm In some cases triple or quadruple but at least double what they pay in or their pensions which isn't a hundred percent of the work but maybe Seventy five percent of what we needed to now have among the highest rated pensions in the country we pay our\nHealthcare stuff ahead of time but you're right the state hasn't really owned up I was going to be a disaster and that was really tough I mean we had protestors today some of the city unions were protesting saying a guy said he give us a contract and I'm going to give them a fair contract but we have to live in our means\nDid you catch it from everybody absolutely love Republicans and Democrats into and out of the fun you gotta love from everybody to some time so it's you know I think I liked that accountability Ryan's\nUm when the homeless issue and it's one of the the things that you've decided to to tackle in a in a big way bigger than the and the other mayors but still when the city council decides to put up new

protests Roger peasant west and sat down with folks they moved to three blocks away into resolution and use the old place to build permanent housing for folks have been homeless so we got actually double the number of units after all that right\nBut this one in Sherman Oaks is gonna is really a lot\nThe house member who's not backing down there too and you know I I grew up there are a lot of people say hey would you put it on your block I get that all the time I Would love it had been in my block there was a homeless guy that woke me up last year and a half probably every three nights at four AM during his watching our used to go out there to talk to him and tried to give them some food\nUm and we need to solve it in the neighborhoods where it exists we can't just say hey do there's

I think I'd love to stay here to the last day of being there this is such a privilege to be the mayor\nUm but this is these are kind of dire times too so it's only reason I'm thinking about it and

stimulating talk [noise]\nThan\nWalking back to coast to coast limbic tag or with us Lynn is one of the central voices in the new consciousness movement she's the author of several great books including the field and the intention experiment in her latest the power of eight Lynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect\nOf the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program hey George it's great to be back you two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn in we Jeff calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or they could hit as a category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down and it the it hit a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens it works and\nIt does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep fit uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just courted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now we've run about peace intention experiments trying to lower violence um\nLast September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the most violent place in America which is believe it or not a U.S a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri ...\nAnd we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked at and I had a professor of statistics look at this from University of California and she saw that\nCrime went up in St Louis has a whole property crime went up in St Louis is a whole property crime went up went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on here\nWhat do you think this is what are people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the feel of what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our thought everything is energy and our thoughts are another kind of energy when they're\nAh work together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster to purify water to healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and you\nKnow of those thirty three twenty nine have shown measurable positive significant effect\nDecided to walk into a trend that the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know new pharmaceutical drug has his good record is that in terms of studies so so as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things\nAnd when you get a group of people doing thoughts together\nThere is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things now maybe he'll think\nThe experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I Lived in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I could be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in the Arab countries I was working with a guy like the Deepak of the middle east and also very prominent Israeli\n... a documentary producer so we had eight and Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world so we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence\nWe chose it because it's you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together and what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know\n... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does added to play the ... if you're a beach in positive move that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individual for instance we did an intention once for a kid called Luke who is Fifteen Years old\nWho tried to commit suicide it through and so forth of forty foot structure after is he broke up with this for a serious girlfriend\nAnd he'd broken everything he had brain damage she had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community to start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLuca better in record time the doctors didn't even think it was going to live but\nHe got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid\nHold it worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you ... scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George now I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of Arizona's noted psychologist\nAnd a Jessica us who is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research I worked with the late ... and Roy I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert\nUm I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's miserable\nAnd then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up\nAnd we some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientists didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had it real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my\nReaders all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if

it comes in exactly what they need as a bank refund\nOn in the blue\nOut of the blue another woman over spent and she gets you know she over spent\nOn a holiday or group doesn't intention for she

suddenly here from Lloyd's of London\n... she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue so this happens so

know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all ... state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its\nIdentical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at the immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this [noise]\nUm but one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas near it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is a hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd ... the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we\nWe actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas nerve also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intentioned experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be ... that would be an interesting for\n[laughter] well you know we're doing one this that this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in ... county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence but\nWe've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou were talking about a mirror of what is\nWhat in the mirror affect me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing effects among the receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intentioned experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me was one happens to the participants in these intention experiments\nSo when we started doing these these experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and were they able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked them how it was for them and I was getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek remember these are people who are participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy\nAnd the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful they were making up we've relatives that we're getting along better with their partners they were getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nSo that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful [noise]\nSo in a way that's probably the more the most powerful part of the intention experiment if not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation and what happens to those people need changes their lives being part of it\nWe're gonna come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we talk about the power of aid but we'll\nCalls in just a second I'm coast to coast am Lynn

own life and seen it in in many in many instances but there seems to be some sort of scaling up in a group you know I I wrote about this is my last book the bond about how we are really need to be part of the community George\nAnd you know that is are are kind of birthright it's also are feeling of\nOf coming home in a way you know we were only meant to be in groups we were never\nAnd we were always part is supposed to be part of the greater home we've never supposed to be alone\nAnd I think there's something about that group support that group feeling that you know you got a load of

instance when I cook even group they're total strangers\nAnd they don't meet in person they're meeting virtually you know they're meeting on Skype or sue or conference call or something like that\nMany of them end up feeling like this is a badge of people who are closer to me than my own family never they never unless they've never actually met them in person\nAnd not the incredible thing

coast to coast limbic Tiger Woods Lin is one of the central voices and the new consciousness movement she's the author of several great books including\nThe field and the intention experiment in her latest the power of eight Lynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I get an intentioned a bit when several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas uh the topic could hit as a category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down in the ... hit a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens it work sending\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep fit uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just courted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now we've run about peace intention experiments trying to lower violence\nUm last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence and the violent place in America which is believe it or not a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri yes\nAnd we calculated the result Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor at ... look at it from the University of California\nAnd she saw that crime went up in St Louis has a home property crime went up in St Louis is a whole property crime went out went up in the ground and neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down like forty three percent for before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so it's going on\nHere and what do you think this is what people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the field but what's out there\nBut what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field\nThe ... energy field and what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our thought everything is energy and our thoughts are another kind of energy when they're\nAh worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster to purify water to healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and\nYou know of those thirty three twenty nine have shown measurable positive significant effect\nDoes that as long as the trend of the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that has that kind of track record you know new pharmaceutical drug has his good\nOr record is that in terms of studies so so as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together\nThere is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things now he'll think\nThe experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I could be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries\nI was working with a guy like the Deepak of the middle east and also a very prominent Israeli ... a documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know I'm just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know\nTo end all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play ... in that if you're a beach in positive will\nThat generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we did an intention once for a kid called Luke who is Fifteen Years old\nWho tried to commit suicide through cell fall for forty foot structure after is he broke up with this for a serious girlfriend\nAnd he'd broken everything he had brain damage she had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLuca better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid\nHold it worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I know I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of Arizona the noted psychologist\nAnd a Jessica too is a very well known professor statistics and has been doing working consciousness research I worked with the late ... Roy I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert\nUm I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an odd kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable\nAnd then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up\nAnd we some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientists didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had no real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that\nThey really helped me set up because they're the scientist and then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or on Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results and the reason we wait a while is\nSafe for the peace experiments if you just do it a week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's going on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nTo knock block contractors from donating to the un arranged city already require companies to disclose any work on the border wall to astronauts from the U.S and Russia had made an emergency landing after Russian booster rocket carrying them into orbit to the international space station failed just after one\nNASA astronaut Nick Hagen cosmonauts Alexei ... uh lifted off as scheduled about one forty hour time so just under three hours ago and it was in Kazakhstan using a so use booster rocket they were set the docket the space station six hours later but the booster suffered that failure just minutes after the launch\nThe department of justice has allowed CBS in ... not to move forward with a multibillion dollar merger with some conditions at numbers come up with a plan to sell its prescription drug plan business sense of competes with CBS\nOfficials are concerned a loss of competition would result in higher prices poorer service and decreased innovation\nAnd DNA evidence has found the shark the bit a Thirteen year old boy lobster diving off the coast of San Diego county was a great white the boy was seriously hurt in the attack last month the teen needed surgery for a wound that stretched from his upper back in body to his arm and the size of his face\n[noise] traffic from the ... center of problems in South\nGauge Thomas up inside of the seven tentative Uriel highway two car crash into the eagles and the second leave from the left to see each being into ... senior ride bunch up you're\nProbably wasn't Firestone boulevard just off the wall and the rest of your time travel going Tripoli five hundred five thousand brief give it to be leaving Long Beach shortly after the one of the three the terminal island freeway Pacific coast highway does have a big rig broke down to the right wing just before the PC ...\nSort of a sixty a reservoir records you offer them shut down their crews are on the scene what struck Peter slowing of the main line and distorted in Irvine self and four or five ... to one thirty three for\n... two left lanes off limits could do with just fall off\nThe virus got help get you there faster how ...
