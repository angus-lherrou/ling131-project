I heard radiolab just open the up\nAnd to have fun guy\nEver seen a thousand dollar bill weld thing anymore so you won't even if you want a thousand dollars Monday morning Twain five oh five five point jail by heart radio station\n[noise] and\nIf I Am a secret boyfriend has one last time so I'm I Am a admittedly\nLeaving out some are really really good\nSubmarine movies and and I have to say they uh they tend to happen in World War two the enemy below is a terrific movies he's ever seen it [noise] with courage jargon as the uh the Nazis submarine commander\nPlaying a playing a ... get away with with an American a\nDestroyer anti submarine destroyer and at the end of the movie uh they they changed the ending in the movie originally any of the movie was at the American destroyer\nSinks to the boat and uh and that's it [noise] or we when they lose damn the Nazis the ending of the movie has the American destroyer actually colliding intentionally ramming the surface you boat with Kurt ...\nAnd uh [noise] and uh uh\nBob Mitch I'm Robert mentioned as the American commander and that is a fatal wound to his destroyer so the movie ends with courage Oregon's and Robert ... saluting each other\nFrom the uh common cowards the submarine or from the bridge the destroyer but both ship sink and it it's sort of the honorable enemy you know kind of a kind of in a very good very good I got to say\nUm there's a few science fiction movies that you should really avoid voyage to the bottom of the sea that's another piece of sixties flap trap pure Peru but I Will admit I had that submarine model as a kid a cause that went on to be a TV show that ran for a couple of years which to the bottom of the sea with the glass nosed\nA submarine which I never bought from the beginning because it was what\nA it was the United nations submarine\nOh and then of course a there was a movie where the submarine with Raquel Welch in a a a half a zip down wet suit um the or a fantastic voyage where to clear a brain tumor in a famous scientists had\nThey have to shrink a submarine down microscopically so we can be injected into a human body and it's it's a it's a bunch of crap so don't watch that either um but so anyway hunt for Red October ... October\nUh came out uh\nIt was the tail end of the Cold War a you know let let's be honest here it was a Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen Ninety when it was released and the Soviet Union was circling the drain in fact it wasn't even a Soviet Union anymore\nAnd the novel during the Cold War was a a bit of a sensation that was a photographed on Reagan's desk I have a first edition of hunt for Red October but they're very minimalist a cover I I read it in college when I was a navy r._o._t._c. I I Love that that is great\nAnd the iconic Sean Connery as captain rainiest and Sam Neal the Australian as a sex so\nI remember at the beginning he kills the political officer every Russian submarine used to have a member of the Communist Party called these ...\nAnd he has a purpose was to watch for the [noise] the socialist education and morale of the men and that was a sample it who team if you're a member of the guy he kills is actually named ... another fact a very accurate facts\nAbout the Russian a naval submarine service\nIs that they did have members of the crew\nWho were undercover G R U agents and KGB agents or the KGB was primarily a internal spy agency\nAnd the KGB had a planted agents all through the Russian military and yes in fact at the end of the movie when the when cooks aid Logan of turns out to be a a KGB agent that's very accurate um here's one inaccuracy in the movie\nAnd now let's see if you can pick up on this\nUm this is something I noticed actually first time I saw the movie when when Sam Neal says torpedo impact in twenty seconds so listen to this clip I think you'll know where I'm going with this\nTwenty second [noise] what [noise] what books are direct [noise]\nFive a biography of policy called the fighting sailor about to name a conduct tactics [noise] notice [noise] you know effects conclusions were over all ten seconds soldier\nNine eight seven six\nFive four [noise]\nYeah that was twenty seconds and of course captain ray mia says it very cool conversation with Alec Baldwin I Believe this was the last time Alec Baldwin was watch 'em all but um that\nThat actual time this is what I didn't get about the movie is that if your going to give me a countdown if you're going to tell me that something is going to happen and twenty seconds in movie time\nDoesn't make it happen and twenty second because that entire conversation with Jack Ryan at the helm of the red October and the captain remedies that took twenty seconds on its own\nSo uh that's the ... as far as I Know that's one of the only inaccuracies out here's a quick little known a personal connection with the hunt for Red October\nUm when Sam Tierney the uh when Tierney the the director when he wanted\nHeavy stormy North Atlantic sees for the scene where the crew comes off the rack Tobar and they're rescued by the U.S navy they went up to the Strait of wanting to a few ... which is between the Olympic Peninsula and Vancouver Island uh Canada was where I grew up\nA port Angeles Washington and what they did was they hired a bunch of buddies of mine who are extras as the Russian sailors on the deck of the product over but the problem was promised he virtually guaranteed crappy weather\nWhich normally is a sure thing between November and march uh the Strait of wanting to ... is it looks like it's an army it looks like it looks like a typhoon they never got it and that's why in the movie\nThey have to put up that early CGI I'd have to make it look windy and rainy when in reality it was a beautiful sunny day and it wasn't a wave to be seen so that's a quick little personal note about hunt for Red October it's anyway that's my half assed a review of of a summary movies I probably I probably will see hunter killer\nOr if you have seen it feel free to ... to a tweet me in that dark secret place\nAnd not tell me it's good or whatever we'll we'll wrap it up tomorrow and see how does this box that was All right that is it productive replace ... this week uh October twenty seventh through an Eighteen see tomorrow on

just a castle and the killer full three make sure that\n[laughter] finally over\nNow like silver follow these simple rules Daytona ... further instructions [noise] and I heard a radio station\n[noise]\nFound Michael ... from the KFI twenty four hour newsroom seats in the Amber Alert for a man cops in upland say kidnapped his ex girlfriend in the\nCouple's young son Fifteen month old baby or Alexander authority now say the toddler was found say with his mother after police stopped the vehicle in the Claremont area police fairly arrested the man wanted for the two kidnappings officials say three alarm fire an industry spread from a pallet yard to to nearby warehouses\nWas first reported around eight Fifteen tonight on Salt Lake avenue the fire spread was reported stopped ad about nine ten tonight fire costs and power lines to go down across the railroad tracks used by metro or like when firefighters suffered an ankle injury\nThe FBI has it's going to be working round the clock to find out what led to the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh where eleven people were murdered\nIn the most horrific crime scene I've seen in twenty two years the Federal Bureau of investigation members of the tree of life synagogue conducting a peaceful service in their place of worship for brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith FBI\nSpecial agent Bob Jones says the bureau will look through the suspect's car his social media everything in his life to find the answers\nUs attorney Scott ... says officials have filed twenty nine federal charges against the alleged shooter forty six year old Robert Ballard President Trump is ordered flags at federal buildings across the country to be flown at half staff insulin respect for the shooting victims\nAnd one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment\nYou know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\nThis is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged in allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means\nStories that inflamed the census right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history\nNot even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird or white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law\nAnd journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call and letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because\nOp rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men\nFrom the train [noise] uh but [noise] this is the same reason I Love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to to crime before her death I interviewed I'm a true\nCrime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric\nTo focus on the acts of the killer or a fetish size the details of somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think\nSo I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead in a synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham and not run for your life [noise] ah all because of a\nStory seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine\nWhen we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalist need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's so many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things have ever happen not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about\nMurder whenever you talk about people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStave victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today say a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering\nAmerica's most elusive serial killer that even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to\nGet justice next on coast to

sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day in writing crime at night\nThe the uh uh I was saying that crime stories are packed into it because they they uh come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about and don't normally talk about\nIn the case of the man trying I didn't make a deliberate thoughtful intruding on to the subject I got hooked like a fish or I was I was I saw a documentary about the murders and all those cars are called ... living with a mystery\nIt's an extremely well done\nA documentary and far above them normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing\nWhich is that it's relatively obvious that the ... murders are a part of a serious so I started I was just going to put it on our end to end to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a weak the weak eventually became five or six years\nOr so that I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a a true crime booked sure yes it is\nYeah you know and that's the interesting thing is to is that true crime you know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers who's the circuit riding preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution and they would do a sermon just before the execution\nThat would try to provide the context for why this person was being executed and wide to community overall would benefit from his or her death and it became it became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their execution sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early

sense of some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On a new exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just they pay that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was a a a ... his great great aunt had been was one of the victims of the crime\nEngine and he had always believed that uh uh the man who uh was accused of murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released a hate always believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book that\nIn our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief to where it was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that\nBut it was it was a show he said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a\nA random

people\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in ... a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people have our lives happen to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment for they went to literally every night all of the things that that\nHappened who happen to have happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they let die terrible bath I'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nI think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the tone for the um the things that people age\nOr the way the houses were constructed or their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThe ... and ... there's what is that always sticks with made it okay to party or just back there and that has to do with the the taco in the case of taco invent that it\nUh one of them I think it would suck co ... had an alibi for the time of wandering\nThe crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty four of I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um\n[noise] he had\nA witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering\nA to his neighbors in a tally and community um a pickle deal because trickled deals were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them the a\n... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would write with not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian as a way that the Taliban American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important to them a crime story and that's what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that eliminates the details of uh uh or something with otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us very effectively to ...\nIowa I'm ended the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nOn on a night of a gym and I am Nineteen twelve or the lights were out in Alaska due to a um a dispute between the bullets cause city council and the power company so\nThe um [noise] uh that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial Hi yeah uh I don't know that you raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a\nProper memorial to the victim victims were mostly poor people most people without\nA without one and the more family was very well why they are and the community uh thought well off and the vigorous efforts to solve the crime was a kind of memorial to them but I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers\nIn ... where there is an effort to try to so it doesn't enough to be like a statue\nBut it is interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics piece that explains everything you know that that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um one of the national trade crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder to families and whatnot and joining out the uh uh but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell yeah well that's a house right there um but it still it has not forgotten or many places\nMany places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally I'm absolutely forgotten but at some of it it's still quite well remember [noise]\nSo I Want it you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because\nIt

couldn't tell you what it is\nSo is there is a map fractals theory but there's also the so the theory about um how ... theory relates to us personally and psychologically people will talk about fractals in terms of that we we we have a tendency to replicate\nThe circumstances that are defining experiences in our life because that's how we know ourselves best [noise]\nSo somebody who might have grown up in a very dysfunctional household\nTends to cleave toward dysfunctional relationships not go the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know how to act and so they keep re creating that until they break the habit [noise] um so practical theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and you said\nYou know somebody from being destroyed in the fire so you become a fireman so did you did spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment tend to think so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate by recreating the circumstances all on the various ... of America\nWell ... that there is something odd about him the vet he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was\nOr his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to him and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nAnd some variation but more specimens specificity as it got went along so that you know the ... the early patterns or not that type but the the later patterns get closer and closer to the first crime it's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that's that's who he was a that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt\nThat Mr ... had been the victim of terrible abuse has young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh he had tiny widely spaced teeth or he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look and here that he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd it's a terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that that is in any sense of justification for what he did but I don't doubt that that was true of him\nYou know the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the courts that's what happened um speaks to\nThe age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether and I'm sure you've done and this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know just in barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation in the book because a lot of things we don't know about it you have you you can have no after you can have a speculative answers up to you\nI wouldn't speculate that he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newton family in Eighteen Ninety eight I I Would I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because there's an obvious lack of planning and\nI'm preparation for the event ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I see this very much would suspect that he had been\nAdding inappropriate interactions with young girls that he had a\nA well he had it had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and he says he ... his the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was um it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had a he he carried\nIt carried a banker pretty open by the uh but I so I don't doubt that there were other violent and for them through and about his life\nThe um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that's that's a great point we're headed going into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which he grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year\nThere had been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who is the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse a sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they just you know the ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of relief and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before you came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not um\nIt didn't have any charm it was not even an ours ours is generally as a charming right off and well spoken truly makes a good appearance he didn't do any of that\nMaybe it was it was a true cycle a psychopath have no fear over the norm I Do not have normal fear and one thing with a parrot about this ... who's the back of a trade is that from his crime is it ... it was not\nYou're not acting in fear he was he was calm in the middle of events that\nAre horrific events that anyone else would have been kicking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with this with all\nThis Robert I should have made this this other point first the story of a Paul Miller andme after the trade is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in\nTen years or Fifteen\nAnd going to say well here's what the James's Smith they miss this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the whole story about this crime and when that guy Illinois and the\nThe I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacity so we moved on and part of the book but there is still more story to be discovered there\nYeah it's very

discovering America's most elusive serial killer Bill James is the author and it's a it's just a terrific read very good writer a and a and yet you know the until bill\nThere was not a lot it means he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers it's\nFair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was I tend to rent blogger but his application was definitely somebody who came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know I mean just like even today we don't think about the people just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are they get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through in a couple of weeks I'm\nIll I got a couple of questions first of all I Need you to answer for me again ever seen any evidence from a ... like when the actor\nYeah but I really hate what any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe ah I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the Alaska murders were committed they ah it it's still\nIt's still around and and or has been presented with a guide to the to the murders and the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have a lot of it and so\nAll right you know what this on a dairy by nature\n[noise] no we don't it disappeared ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be but he ... he went back to Europe and continue to murder people bought that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much go at all if your dog or he might have worked for the world road is how he got every place that it did and maybe Sunday night where there's lay overnight or something like that but thank you for being on the air and I appreciate your story\nThat you might like we should that hey you know actually that's a really good question too about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\n... what ... what a in a modern criminal investigation or if a criminal record murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed or if a ... and if it happened a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers who will\nWho read the murders on weekends or the or because they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to\nThe um [noise] ... would have probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working I'm self into the trap stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that it's a lot is talking\nBut the the just working on solving that frame of mind that he get where you needed to be\nA ... the ... do we and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or what do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country\nYou know it was it was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen a ... and ... and he came into town may no contact with anyone spoke to know\nAnd then the lynching piece which is definitely in the book and then the state of the police those were the other questions you have a

the experiments that inspired Frankenstein so as you're heading into the holiday weekend a and getting up to a Halloween on the way this is a it's a fun story to read because it's it goes to show you the science behind what was this since ... science fiction story\nNow people don't think of Frankenstein as science fiction that you know sometimes it's sort of is like a big morality play\nBut it really is in many respects ... one of the first major big selling Science Diction works and that's because um if you really if you think about the ... like it was like a I robot\nBoth the ... version and then the robot that came before as most they're all kind of play on the same themes that are that are explored in Frankenstein\nBetween you know the creator and the creation and in fact in the very first\nVersion of a robot before the asthma version of a robot um the robot that is created\nIn the very first version of I robot which was in the late Nineteen thirties or sits down and read

Juanita\nOn a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this ... this was this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people to come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\nAbout right there are about forty thousand usually um have you on Halloween just telling me that soft about a hundred thousand people um and of course of the month and a quarter million though the massive amount of people that small city to to the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this was one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween in jail as the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really important I mean we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about ... on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\nA ... that there are other places around the world outside of the Salem\nThat had massive\nHanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that film wasn't the first ever which wasn't the last one of the ... the biggest wasn't the strangest for them you know there are you know the first for trout America you'll victim was in Connecticut and Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that lives but still that's an extraordinary number of which is killed\nThan it honestly it's really a problem today even in in those countries

of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment\nYou know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\n[noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means\nStories that inflamed the senses right that sensational journalism\nThe kind of news riding that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way this is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history\nEven a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a mocking bird or white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law\nAnd journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the tree\nUp but this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime\nIs allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime\nBefore her death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be

we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not wading into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest it up so not everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things I've ever happen not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were a conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy level radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you\nWhenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about uh people who you believed to be\nGuilty of some thing\nStay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in

tracking this story then required you to go through a lot of newspaper archives and other things to try to find a lot of these stories which as you point out had been\nA they had the dots on human conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person than ever started putting this this case together in this way\nWell yes we were ... except for the end of the the the the last year the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was on the loose\nFrom Nineteen eleven uh Nineteen twelve which would run around and killing a lot of people but the earlier crimes we what we did was say\nLook this this this murderer is way too experienced to have started this in nine eleven there have to be earlier crime so let's try to find them\nGetting ordered walking back toward the first crime\nThat's when a goodness nobody had wanted back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year so successfully\nDumb luck and it's not all of them\nHave ... I had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that\nBecause I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books with very off of a serial murder when he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all the times he will be ... in seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then we'd be out and start a series of crimes\nAnd he would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd it is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper town for the country where New Yorker and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in death and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the uh with uh with\nThe last ... last murders and the series so are we\nJust luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argue that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the poster type ... he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then excessively after that it is is the years went forward and yet\nThere was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times you were guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about nine to five the uh I think that he while he use an ax to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house\nWas shot before he was hit in the head with a max my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket and his belt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and confronted him but um\nIt was not what are you trying to do but this way we do if you had to do\n[noise] to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next door but before I Do\n... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... to all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\nThe what the general answer the question is a crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our of ourselves\nThat we don't like to talk about a all crime stories are about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are a part of you and me I don't know you but they are part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing\nAnd and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of the uh uh\nThat's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader ... by the way it but last book I read was the real crime but with the real world leader\nA it's a book by 'em back Weinstein's a or leave it Weinstein I could have a last name or uh the uh I\nThink I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you know there should be a it'd be it\nAnd and one of the things I learned from reading that is a white American block of who was a an avid reader of crime stores or Charles Dickens was going to have them at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding was it's it's very common among writers to be avid readers postal I was an avid readers of crime stories\nBecause the ... what I just talked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat\nThe uh you don't get from sports I mean that's what I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what who we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try and do positive things\nHang on hang on to that thought on crime stories as this were picking up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive serial killer and there's one story or

likes to write about crime so ... you want to finish that\nYou're you're waiting out here and I was not able to hear a lot of them\nI'm fading out no Canada that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day and writing crime at night\nThe the thing that crime stories are very good because they they come from the parts of ourselves but we don't like to talk about don't normally talk about\nThe man a crime I didn't make a river I thought oh entered into the subject I got hooked like a a I was I was I saw a documentary about the murders and all those guys were called ...\nIt's an extremely well done\nDocumentary him far above them normal levels of crime talking after\nI was in there then I have and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing\nWith you that it's relatively obvious that the murders are a part of a series so I started going to put an hour into Andhra trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a week and we actually became five or six years\nOr so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a true crime book her yeah\nYeah you know and that's the interesting piece too is that true crime you know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with the ...\nIn journalism I'm accepted in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit writing preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution and\nThey would do a sermon just before the execution that would try to provide the context for why this person was being executed and wide to community overall would benefit from his or her death and it became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their executions sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in even know what your hundred plus years leader in some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of um a a kind of healing anyway not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved\nBut for these communities maybe this just lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On an exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nThe um ... there was an interesting thing that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was\nA a a ... his great great aunt had been was one of the victims of the crime engine that he had always believed that uh uh the man who ah was accused of her murder\nAnd was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released have always believed that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book that in our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what happened was just a tremendous relief correct yeah\nIt was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that\nBut it was it was a he said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime as if this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was ...\nI I don't know why it was important to him too well I understand for the ... understand the sense that was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it unpunished I've I've I don't know that there's a lot of different\nBut are you still have that reaction to it\nYou could go ahead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book and a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all ... all good books or church for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred\nThey hurt a hundred years ago and uh I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these that these murders occurred to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was one of the ... ah what how people live that they they lived rich meaningful live\nA ... people\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people have our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired and they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that\nHappened who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to\nCreate a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they look bad terrible death but also I was trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling a story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the town or the um the things that people age\nOr the way the houses were constructed around your communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism conscious I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nAnd then there's what is it that always sticks with me that illustrates the point you're just back there and that has to do with the the taco and the case of soccer and then that it\nUh one of them I think it was sock co ... had an alibi for the time of one of the crime what are the crime was committed on December twenty fourth\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering\nA to his neighbors and Italian community um a\nPickle deal because pickled deals were a delicacy that weren't even on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them on on ice for a couple of days before you eat\nThem the a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would write\nWith not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true Italian as a way that the Taliban American communities lived a hundred years ago\nThat it's important in a crime story and that's what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that eliminates the details\nOf uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa I'm and did the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are
