O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in those glaciers is there is a north\nAmerican oceans will I bet well\nPlanet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um\nBut yes the waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick sealed to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to breathe the all but\nIf we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be terrified and within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with what country but\nThe Martians\nOh they're going to do with themselves\nYou know when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they want you as soon as I ss and they bring us back a rumble set of tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple of cosmonauts an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm\nThe revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch company is my guest the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they\nMoved away from command economy um but Russia [noise]\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise] and uh the the uh and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin

close the goals Robert Zubrin with us we'll get to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\n[noise] well [noise] I'd say China right now I'm is\nAbout where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven [noise] um I mean in terms of manned space flight a you know they've been to earth orbit they've I mean there are a bit beyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they did launch a small space station which we did not have them\nDo they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon ... um\nThey can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay\nIt's once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and ... these entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't do and they can do the things that those companies can do in one third the time at one tenth the cost\nAnd if uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with understanding that they're going to need to have rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals\nWhole industries for people because um eat no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh solely ... once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power it's right or you have to be first class in space\nUm Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean\nYou know a a a reason is a stick can be in a certain I mean ... ... the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was and the twentieth century you illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James\nBond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I Know I I I don't think\nThey're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nA less we hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the ... states that one\nWeapons okay I mean because what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well ah the presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatize then gee it'll just be a the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise]\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um\nAnd also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working steps walk to go [noise]\nAnd um\nYou know he once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody doesn't\nWhat about propulsion we're we're going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure will um now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those beeps\nOr they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not feel [noise] you get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows or\nThe you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion too are but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel [noise] um [noise]\nWell um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so it sounds like what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen\nTo your show like\nAnyhow I'm enjoying the show the ... and the idea of a question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering I'm going to get there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like America do like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK well there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead Rob a okay All right well here's the thing um [noise] there there\nIsn't intelligent life on Mars now okay they may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people\nRight and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually\nBelieve that while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are no Indians there are no buys in herds there are no red woods there's just a desert with\nMaybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks um nobody be picketing\nColumbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen\nYou know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space X is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of the Japanese blends the mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point\nUh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nUh being launched a ... in the very near future that is because a mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value\nAnd uh and and and the exchange for those claims and people could get a exploration missions finance\nMine the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable\nSo last combined with C. O. two increases\nIn other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and they help us to deal with the potentially back here and also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars\nHow would you profile a potential candidate a travel on a ship tomorrow what type of person always looking for\nAll right let me take the question is one of the first question it the hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you're a far away from the sun it's called\nA and if you're in earth orbit time it depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\nUm but\nUm\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can you can get the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so\nYou kinda have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay hold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit the brake already school by fast with you Robert

they captured some of the to split\nA as did we but I I got to tell you well I mean you know I mean there's no question that von Braun and his team were top notch and and we actually got the real rocket engineers Soviets captured a lot of the two rockets\nBut they they mostly got the second tier kind of people we we got\nWe got the cream of the crop as they say\nYeah we did um but um you know by the sixties we had developed our own rocket engineers although the German team continued to play a role through about the early seventies um I met a few of them\nWhat's amazing to see people who are born in the eighties for example Robert or even the nineties\nNever had a chance to experience what a lot of us went through a lot of people who are listening to the program right now during those

America once again to become a country whose Creigh Deeds are\nTo be found in newspapers and not in museums and ah you know and so you know like the Apollo Thirteen movie or just now the moody last man for not last man first fan\nFirst million while there may be the last of them now would\nHear hear well I think is a pretty good movie by the way I just thought um\nWhat'd you think about the lack of the American flag being in the movie\nWell no they do show the American flag on more on the moon they just don't show them planting it\nOh okay okay\n... this movie some people found it a bit slow 'cause it was a lot in there about you know good Neil Armstrong's relationship with his kids and his wife and so forth but I thought it was pretty strong especially you know the scenes with the ex if teen and the Gemini and Gina flight\nAnd uh the actual moon landing itself I thought were absolutely riveting and they really gave you a sense of of the risks that were taken the courage that was needed and just the and the spectacular nature of of of this thing and this this this\nAnd the daring of America at that time and um but anyway I mean that's that's that's who we are that's who we have to be we can't be these people who you know say well we don't know how to go to the moon I'm you know I mean that'd be like them in the sixties saying we don't know how to fly airplanes\nBut through the day but the Salem mass say David go ahead sir\nI didn't ask you both and thanks for taking my call George sure thing\nI'm OK storm it's interesting to me how what you what you're talking about a few minutes ago it was really played into my question you know we've talked about you know how life could be sustained and the things on Mars and already might stay likely do we have any plans are there any theories on\nPossibly can relating an atmosphere where stimulating a life's just learning environment um I mean drilling holes that were released trapped gases or you can be the atmosphere with anything we have or or any series her\nPlans for that\nWell we discuss that earlier in the show but yes terra forming Mars the idea would be if you warm the planet with greenhouse gases she could form a lot of the costs a lot of atmosphere to help us out of the soil\nI've got a book called the case for Mars which um you can get on Amazon and it talks about how we can send people to Mars how we can settle Mars and how we can terra forming Mars that transform it in the way that you're a suggesting because Mars was once in a warm and wet planet which means by the way it had a thick atmosphere\nAnd um it could be made so again\nAnd you believe we must go to Mars don't you\n[noise] well I\nMust I um I I Believe we should uh I Believe that it's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there's an infinite number of world out there for us if we worked together\nDid point Arnie in Roseville, California go ahead Arnie\nYeah Hi I'm ... and ah I just have a question I thought it'd be leaning towards privatization\nBut are you willing or privatization on the colonization of the ... of the Mars or the planet I mean are you going to just be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can ah are you are you with the government should be some more involved in\nThe dating how a possession of real poverty as it was would be more than we ever got to the point where travel was easy\nAlright go ahead and rubber minute left so\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of government so we could see\nWhich kind of government works the best because that's how we make progress\nOn earth you know America was a noble experiment we threw the value of democracy and human rights and\nPeople all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better well if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government to the Russian government or the Chinese government that they formed their own governments\nDon't go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some won't be good idea from a bad idea and the ones that are bad ideas that are not workable those counties will fail but the ones with good ideas immigrants will walk there those places will grow and become an example to the rest of humanity\nRobert thank you again my front always great talking to you Robert ...

therapist author Paris psychologist residing in the north eastern section of Ohio\nHe has a graduate degree in political constantly from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on EMS environmental sensitivity and ghostly encounters\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy gun shot at a clinical therapist get involved and do studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a go for the parents that college even before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so it it actually I actually got a\nDay job and that I study the psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well\nThat's good well let's see they they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when Tony apple was here in the at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teamed up their sports why\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the ghost studies book would give us an overview of what you've been doing Brandon\n[noise] well um [noise]\nYou know I uh I have a degree in psychology or when I was at University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically the environmental sensitivity and go counter um and then when I got back here to this day I got back into the political part a thing\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in and writing a book and that's when I came out with a goat studies\nAnd you know I'm sure listeners to your show no it's no mystery that scientists sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explain and goes by encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things the way to lose the nation interpretations are overactive imagination which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounter kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just ghost stories tales of locations are outdated views\nUm and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know combine real life goes counters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insight and the causes of these throwing encounters\nUm it the book comes up with concise and competing theory and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years and if and I think we're at the point where there's becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several first hand account of goes the encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting for panic how we're going to anyone he would talk to me about goes yeah an awful conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities\nAnd that's what I came up with somebody maybe theories are and that's why I came out the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research to clinical interviews I witnessed the cows and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories of thought and I also reviewed the right the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters well\nThen you bring a dose of real science to the picture your brand new no I think that's important\n[noise] [noise] yeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder\nUm the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some great you know I'm narrow psychology a fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm In tangle man and non locality\nHow electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find in a hurry to research article it kind of like a boring and I don't know what's going on\nBut I'm a lot of great research is out there are just a matter of finding it\nWould have you concluded to date branded about what this ghostly experience might be for someone real big\nImagination what do you think so\nI actually think a majority of the ghost encountered that that are out there I Believe are there are some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to goes way Connors it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's\nEnvironmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes the one of the\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take the more a sigh based\nView on goes so that's a inside is basically um philosophy extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of ... counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em are coming in or being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on\nMy main theories in the book over um what I call a a tele Patrick distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's collapse of the uh is a real or it was a real important part of it goes way encounter\nHow important than is the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um it's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's\nKind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of it goes link counters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm\nA death or life threatening events\nOr some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters a so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happened after that and one of those things is um\nYou know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening or going to have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these viral energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers\nSort of our innate ability to\nSend a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is that the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these\nThis is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an aberration of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying\nYou know my aunt passed away right on time that I've had that and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying I somehow she sent 'em a tough topic distressing they'll saying to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually\nComes down to something I'm\nPretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are are vying mentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nAre variable line up the habit goes encounter vocation is one person has to\n'em and then there's there's probably other ones that I you know we haven't really identified at this point but the person not only their sensitivity but their internal ... electric\nA consciousness of all this stuff really plays into it and it's really fascinating to me early\nYeah it really is I remember when my dad brought home a better Tv antenna\nAnd it was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears but it had like a little uh knob on it that you clicked in and brought into signals better that way too and I thought for use this technology amazing how times have changed Brenda\n[laughter] I remember those [laughter]\nDo you or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nUh no I haven't and I'm I get that question a lot though the the theme of question seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so I think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great\nUh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the good with the bad weather the positive with that this was at that and I think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's\nDemonic mhm demonic and theme\nIs more of a religious perspective than it is sort of um you know like a scientific perspective so\nUsually whoever classified this is a demon or um you know regular goes\nI think there's more of a religious pills to it um that's why I usually when I meet David knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience\nUm and some people perceive it as good or bad I might receive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience can be terrified and believe it's negative and then kind of you go towards more demonic part a thing [laughter]\nSo I I really just enjoyed not enjoy but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the theme and label on anything well\nWith Brenda ... his book is called the ghost studies ... dot com of course linked up at coast to coast am dot com results show on Facebook and Twitter as well we

know it's okay um ... you know these are positive experiences and their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things and like we talked about before it could have some sort of psychological was unhealthy move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there

[noise]\nYou know the um the question is do you think that there is a subliminal undo channel of communication going on between the go see a permission and the recipient of the ghost experience\nUm maybe perhaps subconsciously is to subliminal um communication to weigh communication going going that precipitate the uh go way up origin appearing\nAnd I had a fool upper recent experience or after

I was seven writer's block on the song and that really destroyed before and coast to coast [laughter] um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm he looks the way he did when he passed away in the

elaborate on what\nCould have precipitated this\nOr does your does your brother pass away or who he was he this was after he passed away\nHow long ago that he passed away a let's see a ... before you go and maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years okay\nRight um well into your second question and we'll get back to the first question one quick so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know with the the husband seeing his wife and then the wife kind of said hey check behind the workbench and he finds a pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is is happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with a complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation the resonate with the consciousness of your brother and I and when you resonate with something it's not just information it's it's visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that I'm unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there's one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night and he has this\nFeeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog you know laying in the water and injured\nAnd you can't communicate with a dog but somehow the dog is trying to communicate with him and had a reading each other's emotions and then he wakes up because the dog that type of thing so\nYou know why there isn't physical communication or words there are some sort of like I'm understanding or reading a mind thing\nWhere did we get the book to go study sprinted\nOr the good at Barnes and noble that Amazon dot com if you like listening to books on radio in the car

you're talking about hotel than a hospitality and meat packing\nAnd farming and it was just goes on and on of industries that hire illegals including the president Donald Trump hires illegal to really help with the maintenance of his property and in the construction trade\nSo the idea you know that this is now become like a great political football forum is the flow of immigrants are not going to

more immigrants coming to the United states but the fact is that we need these people essentially to give the unskilled labor that nobody is willing to do because the industrial section in this country right now\nThat they there's no way that they can build those conditions were just the normal US population\nSo are you just saying let the seven thousand illegals just walk right into the

O. two which is a greenhouse gas and that would warm the planet even more so much\nSo that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much glee freshwater in those glaciers is there is a North American oceans fall I bet well\nPlanet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise]\nUm and the the um [noise] but yes the waters on Mars that's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick sealed to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nIf we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be read the full\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent deficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be terrified and within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do a thorough what country but\nThe Martians\nOr they're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they want you as soon as I ss and they bring us back a well most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm\nThe revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch company is my guest the Chinese though because they've seen the benefit of a of of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy\nUm but Russia [noise]\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government\nUm and because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean ... you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise] and uh the the uh and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing [noise] um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin

talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\n[noise] [noise] well [noise] I'd say China right now I'm is about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven [noise] um I mean in terms of manned space flight a you\nKnow they've been to earth orbit they've I mean there are a bit beyond\nThat I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they did launch a small space station which we did not have them\nDo they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon ... um\nThey can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and ... these entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can do in one third the time at one tenth the cost and if\nUh other countries have gone to uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with\nUnderstanding that they're going to need to have rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so if who wants Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power\nWhat's right or you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a a reason is still could be in a certain I mean ... ... ... the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was in the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to get a launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm all of us who you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well it states that one weapons okay I mean because what after all\nIs a state but it is a a military force that exists well uh did presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force and um\nThe you know um [noise] but no I I don't think that means ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh you know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just the uh the rich they get to go to Mars well [noise]\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um\nAnd also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs walk to go [noise]\nAnd um\nYou know he wants upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds\nA bake launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not feel [noise] you get the oxygen from the air with only a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows uh that you know the next new kid on the block me a ... you know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to orbit\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and uh because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel [noise] um [noise]\nWell um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen\nTo your show like\nAnyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the light as though it and the idea of a question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering will inflate yet there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like America deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead Rob a okay All right well here's the thing um [noise]\nThere there is an intelligent life on Mars now okay they may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people\nRight and\nCan even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and\nAnd we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that law we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nBuys in herds there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with\nSome microbes under the rocks um nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen\nYou know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space X is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese blends the mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um\nFuturistic at this point\nUh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail\nOr that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions are being launched a ... in the very near future that is because\nThe mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value\nAnd uh and and and\nOpen space as opposed to the planet\nAnd what did the advent of kind of go to mercury though with some sort of probes and case back here we have one away a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined with CEO to increases\nIn other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat wave helpless to deal with the potentially back here and also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars\nUh how would you profile a potential candidate a travel on a ship them to Mars what type of person always looking for\nAll right let me take the questions one time or the first question it hot and space if you're close to the sun um if your a far away from the sun it's called uh\nAnd uh if you're in earth orbit time it depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\nUm but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can you can ... the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so\nYou kind of have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people\nOkay hold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit the brake already going by fast with you Robert ... been with us we'll be back will let them finish up Joe's

Braun and some of those incredible mine's\nWell they had some pretty good wants to uh they had ... ah who was a great rocket engineer\nSo as Germans technology that help the Soviets to\nRally they captured some vie to split\nA as did we but I got to tell you well I mean no I mean there's no question that von Braun and his team were top notch and and we actually got the real rocket engineers Soviets captured a lot of the two rockets but they they mostly got the second tier kind of people we we got\nWe got the cream of the crop as they say\nYeah we did um but um you know by the sixties we had developed our own rocket engineers although the German team continued to play a role through about the early seventies um I met a few of them\nWhat's amazing to see people who are born in the eighties for example Robert or even the nineties\nNever had a chance to experience what a lot of us went through a lot of people who are listening to the program right now during those critical time periods I mean the moon landing Sputnik all that stuff was just so historical ah we really live in we have a way you some criminal time several we\nYes but I'd I'd like to see America at once again to become a country whose Creigh Deeds are to be found in newspapers and not in museums and ah you know and so you know like the Apollo Thirteen movie or just now the moody last man for not last man first paying\nRosemary well maybe they'll ask them no one\nHere here well I think it's pretty good movie by the way I just thought um\nWhat'd you think about the lack of the American flag being in the movie\nWell no they do show the American flag on mark on the moon they just don't show than planting it\nOh okay okay\n... this movie some people found it a bit slow because it was a lot in there about you know good Neil Armstrong's relationship with his kids and his wife and so forth but I thought it was pretty strong especially you know the scenes with the ex Fifteen and the Gemini and Gino flight\nAnd uh the actual moon landing itself I thought were absolutely riveting and they really gave you a sense of of the risks that were taken the courage that was needed and just the and the spectacular nature of of this thing and this this this\nAnd the daring of America at that time\nAnd um but anyway I mean that's that's that's who we are that's who we have to be we can't be these people who you know\nSay well we don't know how to go to the moon I'm you know I mean that'd be like them in the sixties saying we don't know how to fly airplanes so\nLet's go to David in Salem mass say David go ahead sir\nI didn't ask you both and thanks for taking my call George sure thing\nUm okay so um it's interesting to me how what you what you're talking about a few minutes ago it was really played into my question we you know we've talked about you know how life could be sustained and things on Mars and already might stay life what do we have any plans are there any theories on\nPossibly humiliating an atmosphere stimulating of life's just learning environment um I mean drilling holes were trapped gases or you can be the atmosphere with anything and we have or or any series her plans for that\nWell we discuss that earlier in the show but yes terra forming Mars the idea would be if you warm the planet with greenhouse gases she could form a lot of the costs a lot of atmosphere to help us out of the soil\nI've got a book called the case for Mars which um you can get on Amazon and it talks about how we can send people to Mars how we can settle Mars and how we can terra forming Mars that transform it in the way that you're a suggesting because Mars with lots of warm and wet planet which means by the way it had a thick atmosphere\nAnd um it could be made so again\nAnd you believe we must go to Mars don't you\n[noise] well [laughter] I\nMust I um I I Believe we should uh I Believe that it's going to be much better future if we do\nI Believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there's an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together the port aren't\nIn Roseville, California go ahead Arnie\nYeah high a night of the fish and I just have a question I thought it'd be leaning towards privatization but are you in Anchorage privatization um the colonization of the ... of the Mars\nOr the planet I mean are you looking at just allowed to be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can or are you are you forget ... government should do some more involved in [noise]\n... how opposition no real property as it was would be if we ever got a point where travel was easy [noise]\nAll right go ahead Robert minute left her\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of corporate so we could see which kind of government works the best because that's how we make progress\nOn earth you know America wasn't noble experiment we proved the value of democracy and human rights and people all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copy that's because it was better\n[noise]\nCamp I Am six forty more stimulating talk [noise]\n\nWelcome back to the coast to coast George ... with you in our desk Brendan to Marcello with us Brandon is a clinical therapist author Paris psychologist residing in the northeastern section of Ohio\nHe has a graduate degree in political counseling from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on EMS environmental sensitivity and ghostly donors\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his ... called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy guy shot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a goes in Paris psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so it it actually I actually got a day job and then I study the Paris psychology and goes\nPart of thing well that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well\nThat's good well let's see they they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when apple was here in the at that time it was just the booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies book would give us an overview of what you've been doing brand\n[noise] well um you know I uh I have a degree in\nPsychology or when I was at University of Edinburgh I've studied or I'm basically the environmental sensitivity and goats countered um and then when I got back here to this day I got back into the clinical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in and writing a book and that's when I came out with a goat studies\nAnd you know I'm sure listeners to your show no it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes by encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away if I lose the nation interpretations are overactive imagination which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than jets ghost stories\nTales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights and the cause of these throwing encounters\nUm it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know ... you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years and if and I think we're at the point where there's becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several first hand account of goes encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting firsthand accounts\nGoing to anyone he would talk to me about goes yeah an awful conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities\nAnd that but I came up with some of these new theories\nAre and that's where I came out of the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research to clinical interviews I witnessed a cow and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories of thought I also reviewed the right the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters above\nWell then you bring a dose of real science to the picture your brand and then I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some great you know I'm narrow psychology of fitness a physics\nThey're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm In tangle man and non locality\nHow electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find in a rate of research I got out of boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there are just a matter of finding it\nWould it be concluded today Brandon about what this grossly experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think a majority of it goes they encountered that that are out there I Believe are there are some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to go on or if it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's\nEnvironmental stuff there's um a internal ... electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them really why did they how\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take the more about five days\nView on goes so that's um inside it's basically um telepathy extra sensory perception those types of things I I really think that a lot it goes way encountered that happen out there um the base of it\nHas to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em are coming in being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on\nMy main theories in the book over um what I call a a tele Patrick distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA start really think that um people's pull up at the uh is a real or it was a real important part of it goes way encounter\nHow important than is the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nKind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to goes land counters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ... counters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm\nA death or life threatening events\nOr some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst that he goes way encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happened after that and one of those things is um\nYou know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening or going to have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these viral energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers\nSort of our innate ability to\nSend a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is that the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these this is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night\nAnd I look to the left and there's a an aberration of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you know my aunt\nPassed away right on time that I had that and I\nAnd I and I think that that you can sort of see there\nWas a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying I somehow she sent 'em a ton of Patrick distressing thing to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and in those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and um you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affects certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nYeah it really is I remember when my dad brought home a better Tv antenna\nAnd it was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears but it had like a little uh knob on it that you clicked in and brought into signals better that way too and I thought for use this technology amazing how times have changed Brenda\n[laughter] I remember the fifth [laughter]\nDo you do or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nUh no I haven't and I get that question a lot of the theme of question seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so I think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great\nUh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the good with the bad with a positive with that this was at that and I think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's\nDemonic ... demonic and\nTheme is more of a religious perspective than it is sort of um you know like a scientific perspective so\nUsually whoever classified this is a demon or\nUm you know regular goes I think there's more of a religious pills to it um\nThat's why I usually when I mean David knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience\nUm and some people perceive it as good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience can be terrified and believe with negative and then kind of you go towards more demonic part of thing\nSo I I really just enjoyed not enjoy but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the theme and label on
