that have solid earnings I'd got money in the bank there she talks could still get hit when everybody else gets hit and they go down but it doesn't mean that company is going to go out of business right\nRight again well any time you get a major downturn in a recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and governments the recession's bad thing\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years the bill but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half\nUp six to seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies will not have well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon it hit upon Amazon there oh my God I was you know like a\nFive and ten years that we used to have both parties used to be more centrist not that far apart now they are extreme far part\nThere's the far right is the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off\nThe far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this I'm much more difficult to social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are polarized this Kavanaugh's thing it was just pure partisan\nYou know the Republicans believed him and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women ... I've never I mean it this there was no common sense no rationality was just political partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats\nHated the Republicans for defending him and in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really I think that that social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis a Republican and say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats who say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate enough and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're going to hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war on the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial an urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue\nThe south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge and I think there's going to be fat I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example of that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd it's hard to argue mid hatred and bitterness on both sides\nAnd even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stuff this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell ya I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kinda like watching on

buy a condo there for a quarter of the price [laughter] and and and and\nBut I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about it the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna it's gonna happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her it's ...\nIt's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover in zero hour\nAnd and are newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes\nAnd this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution cause the greatest boom in global his\nLaw you know Harry I've had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September\nA ... you know there was one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and if I did or didn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position we're coming into a truth out came the marketing gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally comment and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump had that surprise when in the markets were\nHad a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred ... eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so this is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that um\nAnd we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt ... the Democrats did more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest\nAnd that that's not going to win reelection I was just going to last night and\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired up elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or at best Trump holds on and\nNoticed that there were going to peak late next year and see the greatest crashing history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble laughing path next to the end of next year but there there's a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to

spent and when they would stop spending so yeah what we see\nIs it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season it started in two thousand eight will be over a bop bop probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst\nAnd and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next global boom the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics the United states has kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics or we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing with the biggest Boston bubble burst all ready has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bobble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more money there\nSo you could buy these metals and things like that everything from goal\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more on the downside of after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only difference on George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when\nThey die they are literally permanent shelters should want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today massively in Japan and places like Germany there's more people dying and selling homes and young people with the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we just for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sector so it aren't newsletter which by the way people can get\nFree newsletter by just go into Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be ... it'd be in the next year that that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war more what's that going to do to the economy\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting and people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and\nUh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world and makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and and when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nYou know came out a year ago this trade war with China and it is a global thing is well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\nThey ... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to give him too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I was going to Peter and cotton wood Arizona did get things started with assigned Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think ...\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and then that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent\nSo so they're they're at risk or two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a fight ... city tour in Australia is a big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack\nA head of ours this time is it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this\nWe're going to take your deposits and work in a kind of vote them into equity in our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so\nPeople have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your access money other than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I and I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nNext up we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nOr Mr ...

I'm optimistic I'm going to stay on the line because I Know you're going to have questions and I want to get a few legs and because I when I started twenty three sixty thinks the path that I I\nDo think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more flew an account\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and got may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're gonna have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there to owner as we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than health care there on a run and win when that guy too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our public going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens\nIf it makes a changing and the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nIn two thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in a voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWhat will hit the I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly and the great depression but to put it on\nA permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and and the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place\nJust sin if you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they sent everybody at twenty five every household with twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks cause things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger\nOnly made the rich richer is only benefited corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main skill\nOf the reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check you know he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rather than being you\nKnow right if they don't spend it or do they get you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and the have them spend that money to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good to have you\nWell hello there George and now here you have that question for you mentioned earlier about the banks and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I'm placing my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those okay I I Would\nMuch rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems with farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to ... money or pull accounts they're going to do for the more fluent or towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nFor telling here okay thank you\nAnd I think you just answered that part of one of my question but before I asked\nA direct them I guess we can cry you fly a lot of oh I'm In my family I'm lying\nAround yup they play all about timing\nIf all of that time one of my guiding the looming comment on that side of that you just answered my question like\nAbout the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much um I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm a larger account holder is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of off the larger\nAccounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever's scenario and bank insurance agreed that they can insured deposits\nAnd they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are ensure they can't insure everything if you have a major club but the smaller accounts it it'd be spread out and a few accounts and you have more money in your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable than and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounts that those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course\nWhen when things go bad people are gonna hit foreign deposited more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors in foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again I still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans\nBusiness loans go back there going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it\nThey can't they can't\nPledge those reserves and well that's a good thing Harry thank you were at a time here ... website it comes to those damn dot com up next a psychiatrist looks at the journal\n\nIs worse of Orange County near the beach you can find ten percent or higher bill he just hearing you\nKnow two wars I and\nI'm just returned from your local ball team so I Know one thing or two about ensuring a landscaping business Montrose the pros commercial on business and\nHe has had many close brushes with that as well starting in the womb\nYeah you said a number of paranormal or anomalous experiences visions breed cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with message Barry now ... says well welcome to the program Dr many meat is on the coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody would your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\nWell I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders of normal first came out many people asked me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nA doctor is bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he's told by his patience and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nStories from my readers and from my audiences and from family and friends and from my own extensive reading research into the paranormal\nIn terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls with that so many veterans that that [noise] um you know\nThere's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience\nMhm [noise] but the um term near death experience\nYou know it's going back to talk to him in ... in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago I was right now I think he estimated that something like one in thirty Americans that they're headed near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never have the typical near death experience\nBut when I looked at how my close brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had the classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these clothes causes death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism spirituality and then he and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual the first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of ... the mafia\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and when I went to um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic um but at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous\nThemselves don't know it's called an aloe Jeanette transplant mhm was more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer or this worldwide um donor bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nAlthough it's super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um fled transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that fight events that they gave me the transplant huh [noise] now the person who gave me the transplant he lives in an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to be contact mhm and I did back to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the man was a member of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow [noise] so he was flown back into the ... who sent from Washington DC\nAnd the team from the city where I live down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThen I've used to but in touch with him did that happen\nYes um I did actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you save your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and ... here for them you\nKnow he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is that she swab type that's it yeah that that she thought to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor bang\nAnd then I'm ... years later my man came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave me the injection for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live ... yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nAnd Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic realm has that help or hurt your psyche asked your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have no serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to the if the ...\n[noise] however since I had that experience and psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's a fake experience and much of psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference I mean sometimes if a person see something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed that they've lost it on a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of posts death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that\nAnd these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost his I've loved flying will have some type of post death contact with a loved one\nEven if the person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know an atheist and agnostics heaviest experience as well as religious people\nYou see that every one is psyche again I I tend to believe you can agree with you\nOK but\nUh when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or pay cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of visions hundred voices and so on\nDeathbed visions near death experiences so certain types of sake experiences such as ESP\nAnd collect the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh you must be psychic I was just thinking about\nYou right or is that very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or their talent path a fence but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic realm out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they're paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise] um\nThe senators were given invent them images and they told the country it on the images and try to send them to be the fifth and they found that people were more susceptible to let the the when the seat\nAnd it's also true that people are more susceptible to like the when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment fuzzy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happened on ...\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the more Dr ... is with us his book the borders of normal [noise]\nWhen they break [noise]\nI'm Michael grows you're

many let's talk a little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that said a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who's dying to see a deceased friend or relative\nI'm actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he thought his late sister he mentioned oh they're throwing you mentioned her name she was out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWas dying patients and they found\nA lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors and as they got closer to death is visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions rent disturbing at all they were very comforting\nAnd who's giving them the ...\nThat's the question like where's this message coming from you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added we can say it's coming from the spirit world\n[noise] you know but some of these messages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear\nMhm you know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\n... news there was a movie about a government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government leaders to to assassinate them\nAnd you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know when I was dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although\nWe don't really know and and how how did we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable mhm\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um it wasn't a pay cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up this is the message I got I I just said these words that said\nThis is a world of illusion and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition above the\nIdes of march [noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was still she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also says they are told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he ... he ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition still maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the ... after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know\nThat said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregarded things which could be dismissed that superstition is always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride was Richard ... was among horse racing and ... one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse\nOn something else some lost in ... in the movie screaming in you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fair I think people they don't believe in\nThey don't believe in and also they're afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients for being blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery and then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up evil to tell the doctors and nurses\nUm what they thought what they heard while they were out of their bodies with one patient with blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the patent on his docket high\nAnd of course the doctor was astounded there was another case for the blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and he was ... everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put his dentures\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right\nBack but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough\nThere they were they were wild yeah it works it works yeah\nWhat ... what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component like I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's pure normal\nWell I think it's related to the I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual\nI mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences of these phenomena some people call them fake kick some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or Mr polar mysterious Israel different words are being used to describe the same event\nBut I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component\nYeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the Christmas having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\n[noise] do you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] [noise] oh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live in nine to five eight and a day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know\nAbout and I think it should be explored\nUp

psychiatrist in you do have to decide whether a person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference Manny\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone hearing voices certain qualities that would distinguish the fake it from a psychotic experience for example if someone here the voice\nI'm a psychotic ... nation tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nIt could be found if machinery and in\nFact it may be more than one voice to hear the voices talking to each other about the person\nThe voices might be a accusatory or threatening where I'm psychic hallucinations and to be ... feet when\nThey may occur only once or twice in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and climbing the other thing is with fake ...\nYou can't just look at when symptoms that says hearing the voice you have to look at the whole person\nBecause they ... the major mental disorder which affects the ability to function in society whether that person as a student or whether they're going to work\nOr within the family if then if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other him aside from the of the nation from some thought to order or paranoid idea ...\nOr you know feeling so ...\nYou played talking about and that type of thing so that more than just one thinking that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nCan you make a misdiagnosis is that conceivable\n[noise] yes in fact it had happened and this is a psychologist that did it and they ... where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had to each one of them go to a different emergency room and different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patient while they were patients they were actors pretending to be patient\nAhah but they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... they're admitted to the war they were giving medication they didn't take medication and once they got the word the the patients that they were taking so they were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how did they know\nWell because if people were otherwise normal the facts and the fact that they had they were hearing voices and came to their appearance their behavior the conversation that way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything out the vote them completely normal for that fight they can make a diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come to the doctors couldn't figure that out well unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes wow that's true but but but the patients didn't\nEffect because well the patients live with it they they know the honest so well\nThey know the symptoms and everything okay\nAll right let's take some calls for your duty in the Ozarks in

and time\nUh right now it doesn't seem to a law information flow backward in time so I thought I Would make myself an experimental subject and I tried for a year to a record my dream\nAnd at first I tried a member of the seven days a portable tape recorders are kind of clunky mhm and uh and to record you'd have to have two buttons I think like recording play at the same time right right yeah so it turns out that was a nightmare like getting up at three in the morning and trying to hit those buttons\nSo I went back to just writing things down on paper\nAnd of course then the problem is uh getting yourself up out of a dream I figured that method for that that took me some a reliable\nAnd the one I had I had a very unusual dream a and it doesn't seem unusual in that I cited but what happened ... thanks ... is a I was in a situation where I'm sitting with two other people and we're sitting outside it's some kind of a table\nAnd we're enjoying ourselves having like lunch or something\nAnd the one person in the mail and I feel very very close to him I'm comfortable with him and then there's a woman and I don't know her and uh at one point\nThe the nail says uh and we're outside some kind of a format outside or you know couldn't figure out a ...\nBut anyway he says a [noise] a very I have to go to the bathroom you know where it is and I said no you know I Do too we were had been drinking a cup of Vermont I ...

I've never I mean if this there was no common sense no rationality it was just\nPolitical partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attack and this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him in and installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really I think that that social unrest and this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs in soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republicans going to say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate enough and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're going to hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time in the civil war I compare this more of the civil war\nOn the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial an urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's got to be ... I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument in its argument in hatred and bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost the salt and you know ... senators and in the elevator and stuff this every body yeah

and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about the next year also George's this is this is when it's going to you know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her as well\nIt's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover and zero our\nIn our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened\nEvery Ninety years since the industrial revolution cause the greatest boom and global his\nLawn you know here you had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September a you know there was one fellow was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ... meter ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and if you didn't happen it didn't happen then but you could happen now you're saying\nWell you know I mean we we were in the same position we're coming into a\nTwo thousand sixteen the marketing gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally Tom and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turn boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprise when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred ... up a loving hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nUm and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nThat way as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest\nAnd that's that's not going to win reelection I was just ...\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and Trump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking\nNow or best Trump polls on and\nNo disaster we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble lasting pass next to the end of next year but there there's a fifty fifty chance of happening now and you don't want to get hit by that\nFor forty pursue we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what could happen when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes uh China went down a little bit and China made the biggest one was the only stock market that

back to close to grocery done with us we'll get to your calls as well area within that can you predict out five years from now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe troubling economy starting in two thousand a factor in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation when they were predictably spent and when they would stop spent ... what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season it started in two thousand\nWill be over about probably about two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a goal\nWell again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next global boom the differences George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been this far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics in the United states is kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more of their money and\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only the\nOrange or does it real estate has a new factor there's never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent sellers if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan and places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people of the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and then of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be best place to be in the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be the\nNext global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery one happens we have a regional war more what's that going to do to the economy\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting and people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and\nAh the great depression was followed by World War two\nThe disruption a around the world and makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and and when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book came out a year ago\nThis trade war with China and it is a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from Alibaba came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\nThat and they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to give him too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for war is around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona did get things started with a sign Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and then that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging and they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk it too but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a fight city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack\nAhead of ours this time is it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this\nWe're gonna take your deposits and worked in a kind of vote them into equity in our dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that\nHave have it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen to people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens in in in in the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nNext up we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nOr Mr that I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars in for the hurricanes struck and because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why the recovery has been slow the\nFormer New York governor George Pataki is having to head a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in Rochester here where a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower skilled workers who are not finding work enough tax payer for having to pay for their relief\nAnd the you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people laugh not happening up here uh in New York the former Empire State and secondly California which is not friendly to business when people bleed state they insist on taking their\nShort sighted left wing politics with them they go some place like\nTexas formerly all red state which is now only purple or to sum this up uh these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nUh anti five the extreme left wing organization is taken over Portland Ore than the official there are ... anti five run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I'm saying flat out we're facing civil war\nAnd us conservatives are ready to

you're going to ask questions and I want to get a few leg than because Alan HR twenty three sixty six to pass\nBut I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly started swiping money out of ... flew an account\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured um except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have access loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nIn two thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in a voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWhat will hit the I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\n... or ... you know permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nIn the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they just sent everybody at twenty ... every household what twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have help people\nInstead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer as only benefit of corporate including these tax cuts\nAnd has not benefited main still\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend the red line you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or just the you're right that that's much better way to the point is to get every day people some relief and and to have them spend that money to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good that\nWell hello there George and that area that question for you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I'm placing my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage has been it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems was farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center banks thing\nAnd and also when you do with bank if governments have to explore create money or pull accounts they're going to do for the more fluent or towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThen you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or a city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara in North Carolina\nTell yeah okay thank you\nAnd I think here I just think that part of one of my questions but before I ask that\nA direct them I guess one of the crime was fine I'm not oh my God I'm lying\nRight yup play all about timing\nIf all of that time one of my guiding looming comic I'm tired of that you just answered my question like\nAbout the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much um I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm as a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nI mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of off the larger accounts and more affluent people first\nI mean the everyday person is going to be more protected in whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured they can ensure everything if you have a major class but the smaller account it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get out\nYes you're going to be weightless all of that and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting those were the biggest losers those were the ones they and of course when when things go bad people going to hit for the positives more Iceland\nHe has had many close brushes with that as well starting in the womb\nYeah you said a number of paranormal or anomalous experiences visions breed cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with message burying operations is well welcome to the program Dr many meat is on the coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that will happen for you was it the near death experiences that started it\nWell I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders for normal first came out many people asked me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me that my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nA doctor's bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be paid anything he's told by patience and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nStories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and some I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls with that so many veterans that that [noise] um you know\nIt's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience mhm\n[noise] but the um term near death experience\nYou know it's going back Dr vehement moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right I think he estimated at something like one in thirty Americans that had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I looked at how my close brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of the things\nAfter effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these clothes causes death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found get myself a shift from materialism spirituality and then they and an increase need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual the first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of ... the ... yeah I just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because\nI didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well yeah that was that was quite dramatic um but at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it that the the um anonymous themselves don't know it's called an aloe Jeanette ... ... was more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nI just look like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOr the super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um fled transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said we can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing tremendous damage to your body\nYeah was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be in the mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having lapses and that fight against that they gave me the ... ah\n[noise] now the person who gave me the ... he was an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed the contact mhm and I did back him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow [noise] so he was flown back into that don't you send for Washington DC and the team from the city where I live down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back my city\nAnd that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fine of ...\nHave you still in touch with him just did that that are happening\nYes um I did actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you save your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and they hear altruism you know he said the way it came about was um they were having donated drive and one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is a cheek swab Tyson that's it\nYeah that that she fought to get the DNA that's when his name entered the donor bang\nAnd then I'm ... years later my name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know ... we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stems house\nAnd they gave me from Jackson for five days and then he had produce enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to ...\nSo it's not what it's worth but was brought back to where I live ... yes we've become friends and I just I'm not too long ago\nDr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psyche grown has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\nWell I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have no serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see if the ...\n[noise] however since I have that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed that they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of whole staff contact with the deceased loved fun so\nLet's say a widow might see her deceased husband in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post staff\nContact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\n[noise] um and in fact you know atheist and agnostics have this experience as well as religious people\nYou see that every one is psyche again I I tend to believe you can agree with you\nOK but\nUh when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or\nTelepathy or the cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of visions hundred voices and so on that that vision is near death experiences so certain types of sake experiences such as ESP and collect the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you were thinking about that person then you say oh it must be ... that was just thinking about\nIt right or is that very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic realm out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they're paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise] um yeah that's true\nAnd BBC rates were in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to the teeth I'm Deedee could measure what we call them sleep rapid eye movement and then once the ... state\nThe Senate if we'd given invent them images and they were told to concentrate on the images and try to send them to be the face and they found that people were more susceptible to let the when the state\nAnd it's also true that people are more susceptible to a lot of the when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case in most people's cases it just happened on any asleep\n[noise] do
