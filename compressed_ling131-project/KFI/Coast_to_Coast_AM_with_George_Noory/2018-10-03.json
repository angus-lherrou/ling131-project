I mean I think\nA lot of agents you pay something as well I mean a service fee or whatever is that right I mean there might be a I'm sure the origins to do both you know my big get paid by the\nHotels and by the airlines but I I guess what I'm saying is I don't mind paying something for the service somebody's gonna wait that's about all that stuff and actually if they've been there and if they know the territory that's particularly helpful you know\nWell we had a we went to a wedding in Hawaii went to Hawaii for a wedding about eight years ago and we went through a travel agent and because that travel agent does so much business at the Hyatt hotel when we got to the highest they upgraded our room for free\n... back is well that's clearly where the money\nIsn't that great I mean we had we were supposed to be me and my wife my daughter in a in a tiny little\nUm you know a hotel room with two queen beds and they upgraded as to what a living room and it and an adjoining bedroom oh that's terrific and I thought wow that's that's worth\nEverything to go through a drought ladies that agents do in business\nI'd like to try to leverage you probably know what I could look that up for you that's the only time I use them but there was a there really cool they're really great so tomorrow at nine o'clock will uh have a a good travel expert come on and tell us the best time to travel and and like Mark for instance is going on you're going on a cruise right\nIt's starches a cruise and then we go to Morocco and we're just going to go without the crews are trying out it's going to be there'll be tours organized but as you say we we kind of shut up towards but the trip is not gonna be a cruise ship members were in Morocco and we're just\nGoing you're going on on crystal oh that's beautiful yeah it's really when my dad was went on yeah it's it's eight or nine they limit how many people go on and so on Jim\nIt's crazy great it ... it really hits our big splurge for the year\nAnd is there a casino and board there is and um we rushed around a lot of\nTime [laughter] how many how many miles which will be offshore\nI uh well I don't know that you have to be offshore at all in\nOh I don't like it either and and you're in Europe I don't know the United states I think it's twelve miles yeah I'd like that I don't because I took the way I first was acquainted with them is that I took the Alaskan tour of all American yeah and then I Am after and I'm not a big cruise drive and I'm not going to like it but they said well you can go you know you want to ... or\nSo I sort of electric cars I think that's the best way to see it go news to people mentioned that as a great way to see it so I went and I'm telling you is three days and it was so good just like you said to him it was so amazing that beautiful I was already planning the next ...\nAnd then you get when you go back and see like in the islands off the off Victoria\nAnd the islands off British Columbia there how they navigate through those islands how how beautiful the waters I'm sure you saw killer whales yeah I and that's that is you're never going to be able to see that part of America without being on a cruise ship attract so I've been reading just\nThe idea that uh like went on vacation one of the things that is the most annoying about vacations okay where do I eat and you know what am I Do that's taking care of\nLike running for hours of it yeah on it and re packing you know and again you\nKind of took your hotel room where the which is nice yeah\nNow the the only downside is that you can't sneak\nYour own booze on board no that's no that's that's not true most of the ships will allow or an allotment\n[laughter] what I just think it's funny I mean it's such a like you know what there is booze on board though right but you gotta get your you got to bring your own why because\nBecause there are nine dollars nine hole knows who writes too expensive yet you're usually allowed like a a six pack per person the way I rang Bible guy to bring my own yes I cannot afford their drink [laughter] I mean even though they can't sneak anymore than the allotment oh is that right\nCan [laughter]\nI Will [laughter] are you what are what are struggling with what it was on board you didn't break yeah oh yeah every every time a six pack per person wow yeah\nYou're ... somebody in the audience could help me because I'm struggling with my CDs which I now have found helpful for my aches and pains but I Need to take them every day and there I don't think you can bring 'em over there

first of all you can you know those the dogs can smell it and I don't want to do anything that's not permitted I don't want to break the law I'm not trying to sneak it in if it's not all out I don't want to bring it in right so what ... if somebody can hit me on Twitter let me know and I'll go with whatever you say\nYou can look it up I mean go look up like when we\nWent to the Bahamas and they said if you bring your own we'd dad you could be thrown in jail for five years and I'm thinking myself ... you bring your own weed and then we've gotten a cab to the airport and the guy offered us a hundred times to the airport if we wanted to buy we'd for him he knows that connection\nActually that's the other thing I could just get it over there I think they just want to use their own we'd guy in the comments that al ... and John as you\nSaid it went you taking it so that you buy it when you get there that's right yeah that's right I'd done what what's the what's\nThe what where are you going again mark to Spain Portugal and Morocco a wrong maybe I actually don't want to bring it\nYeah yeah definitely in Morocco but I got to wonder like Spain a marijuana rule why are you going to Morocco did\nPick Morocco is exciting rockers are really a jot a cool place over there\nThat terrorist accident or the terrorist attack a\nI'm sure every place is that a terrorist attack but I don't think that there is a particularly dangerous players you\nYou might be able to because they just you're flying out of LAX yeah yeah they were just a story last week of the week before long at a ban on

you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box tell me about the title first of all\n... this is a book that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for a general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over his think outside the box so the\nSo I round the world you see a lot of a nation's now pushing back it's not only Mr Trump it's a number of others as well\nAre the ice caps melting or not\n[noise] what we've had a gentle warming again we've had a degree in the last hundred and Thirty years and so there's a little bit of ... at the north pole and I'd Greenland but the amazing thing is the ah the south pole ISIS getting thicker I Love the show a picture of the Amundson Scott station\nIn in my presentations that I say this is the uh the third station the United states is man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody to come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nUp and they knew\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is in the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice falling off the shelves melting away and everything else yeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheets so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have a big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about cities now want renewal energy [noise] plus or minus you\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't ... if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional a nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind a you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries so this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure\nOr some of the studies\nSay that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the cost of a wholesale electricity\nAnd that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about on my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess\nAnd now they are all modern landfills and in Europe in the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room in or out of the way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty are six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide\nOur water is is a is not where it ought to be but the the Great Lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe the ... the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is making a comeback as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use is a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state so it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more\nOh the and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so busy or as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming matches\nYeah it is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at the grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October it a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite\nA climate skeptic took climate discussion I'm so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible and man made climate change and we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate\nUm and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of age cycles which are uh\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages then we have medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago and it was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were which isn't there causing the

a hundred and Ninety were leaders of signed up to this uh the uh most of them signed the Kyoto Protocol in Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd um it was I was at a conference at the University of Chicago and they mentioned it all the nations of signed up to the Paris accords even\nEven though President Trump has said he's going to withdraw\n... a lot of it is kind of a universal thing\nUm but uh you know the uh the members are not living up to their to their a commitment it's very very tough when you need to uh\nTo impose a things on your nation and you and you uh\nUh have to impose costs on renewable energy and also there's there was this big demand that the world set up to the United nations they wanted a hundred billion dollar annual climate payment to go from the wealthy nations to the\nDeveloping nations a hundred billion annually quite a big amount and a year and\nHas that has completely collapsed a matter of fact the guy who was ahead of that just resigned this last summer and with the ... with uh the United states cutting its commitment or they're nowhere near that they're down about four or five billion dollars a year\nWasn't there a scandal among some of the scientists who were ... you know pro man made climate change with the emails and things like that\nYeah the east the climate gate was called the University of east East Anglia back in two thousand nine\nOr they don't know who ... somebody released thousands of emails either end in sight or or a hacker and these emails showed some very bad a behavior uh there were a a guy that uh\nUh we're saying I'm a don't tell anyone that the United kingdom has a freedom of Information Act or there are people are racing emails uh there were people a trunk hating or data\nOr there were people trying to interview a to influence the peer review process [noise] [noise] I'm\nJust I'm just not a tough situation you know and and my thought is by interpretation is that that the scientists that he's saying and by the way this was a this was the primary mentioned before the climate research unit which is the primary keeper of the world's temperatures\nAre these folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and convince the world if you think the world is going down the wrong track\nOf they were pulling any means to try and do that but they were they were following very very poor a scientific or procedures\nOkay let's go to the phones now Eric truck driving in Indiana hello Eric\nUrge I heard is that the macho guy has everybody doing the ... you just scared the heck out of my guests\nIraq as to hey buddy a many many years ago the founder of coast to coast art bell and his buddy Whitley Streever wrote a book\nCalled the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and what I was wondering was\nOr is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with Yellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming into Kentucky or is it very possible that the fans in both of those movies that very well happen\nYeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that folks can although I understand there's a big went under their young to call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that\nUm manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slowed down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water or the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sink Senate it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian and the Pacific\nThe the theory basically was that are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down and it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this is an actual thing right\nLet's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAnd they'll make it\nStill doing its thing well okay go ahead John\nYeah ah my dad who ah who quiet down I just want to stay you we're\nWe're talking about wind field ... when I when I was living in Oregon\nOkay and\nI used to drive by the wind you know that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and it was about twenty four foot booth flame\nYou know they were were burning off that methane\nGas or where he now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know Chris city now\nCome back and they said no no no it's going to cost whom I Can't have anything out now that can't be the only way you know in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Want to know why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext on let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having Steve von Loor

had all forests and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to to NASA or their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age\nNo scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician hotels you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nWould obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there are\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm\nUh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast but the store called accounts peace it used to be a big court or a big uh port on in in a northwest Italy an\nExcuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise will matter what they what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I I I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like to mention I perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and Don what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections\nThey're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this a lot of ... Sandler\nHeart technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it\nFirst of all any time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real ... weather satellite maps that we used to the many years ago where see an animated cartoon\nThere's a site I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologists she keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone\nComing directly into California and they're being blocked and it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power\nAnd can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricanes they can fall hurricanes\nThey can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not\nAn act of nature it's an act of the military industrial complex would have in our with our weather\n... when I hear about it in the new\nOnes can Steve's reaction to that Bruce like you\nSaid some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that's something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he did go ahead [laughter]\nWell go ahead man just did it exactly right I'm One of these conservatives it happens to believe\nThat the way to Adam is Gail engineered the came trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently at gentleman on his show talking about came to really put out a video called Franken's guys\nAnd the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the body now son well people are so much heck shoes were hit\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said that are going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to its science I mean it's to the point now you can go to a street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want hurricanes that they want to intensify the hurricane through the park\nAnd on top of that then you got the geo engineering of the show on the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything\nNow I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was foolish idea didn't man ever come up with man is not smart enough to harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing\nThat I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord that it's a sham meant that what they were doing stripping the oil um industrial nations away distributing it into the pockets of the little league\nAnd meanwhile China to do with their sky completely with pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to play you know I don't know I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody

have a lot of wilderness in may and we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine\nOr the money was right the property was right the people who had lived there before them we're gardeners they will gardeners this was like a match made in heaven\nWell as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of using the gardening cool the wife is saying that I was going with a shovel wisdom break was so finally the husband get the idea\nThat they're going to gather together with the tools they have ... inventory and then they were going to keep the mole locked up with the exception of two small hand spades\nSo having to accomplish that they realize they were missing some tools\nAnd they started they left\nTo hand spades on what she called the the wife pulled the heat stroke table on the patio and they were using them for plotting plants\nAnd no sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hand spades withdrawn they actually called the police report depth on the property of you know tools and this and that\nNumber could understand who would come on their land and the tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel you gonna run the place Rob the place well crash [laughter] bright he ... and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods [noise]\nThey found one of your shovels leaning under a tree and the wife scope out nine feet off the ground one of the one

they brought a ladder out the husband couldn't Bush just staying it was buried under a tree several inches thick couldn't budget [noise]\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about finding the shovel in the woods showed the cop to shovel in the ... everybody was baffled by you know this turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was\nThe capital look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives\nWell\nAs I said the long and short of it was a couple of days later they came outside and the

messing around with some trees\nAre in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ... and the professor said that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with now this is a Russian speaking immigrant\nSaying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with\nSo when you talk about the the ... or the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was one step above the Bering Sea\nAnd did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice is I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they parked on a\nPulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought it looked clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while and they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and a Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the uh the F ... any abominable below snowman I have no idea\nUh I have a Sanders since book the abominable a snowman come to life and uh you know

got while working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being paid so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words help and SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green\nA green vows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike to see what it was like a navigating around in the dark ...\nAre now during the day they had climbed up the sides of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area right night for the ICC\nBut when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision or by knock you lose your own monarch yellow\nOr that he had bought a law now when they get up into the trail\nOne of the kid says hey what's that and they noticed in the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a battery operated lantern but then they realize that this thing started ... daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them there's just no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAnd they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around and the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they were trying to get closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it\nFinally they got to a place where they

different views Steve the book outside the green box told me about the title first of all\n[noise] sure well that's this is a book that tells you what's your green consult doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over and think outside the box so the title was think outside the green box\nSo it round the world you see a lot of a nation's now pushing back it's not only Mr Trump it's a number of others as well\nAre the ice caps melting or not\n[noise] what we've had a gentle warming again we've had a degree in the last hundred and Thirty years and so there's a little bit of ... at the north pole and I'd Greenland but the amazing thing is the uh the south pole ISIS getting thicker I Love the show a picture of the Amundson Scott station\nIn in my presentations that I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nAnd they leave new\nThey built this last station on stilts at southern modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's\nIt is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole but Annette we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice and falling off the shelves are melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they ...\nAt Arctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about cities that want renewable energy [noise] plus or minus you\nYeah this hundred percent renewable thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional a nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind\nA you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system so if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of batteries so this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure\nOr some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the cost of their whole so electricity\nAnd that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution out there\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about on my book you know I talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes\nAnd now they uh all modern landfills and in Europe in the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another vermin or out of the way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide our water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers as me come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bizarre as opposed to dialogue and he this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is\nYeah yeah it is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to climate discussion so it has become very polarized them\nDo you get booted no\nI've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate\nUm and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are of\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm\nThe little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather and our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in their regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and let people participate with you\nSign up now for ...

about climate change\n[noise] well they uh the world leaders have pretty much signed up to this more than a hundred and Ninety world leaders of a a signed up to this ah the ah ah most of them signed the Kyoto Protocol and Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd um it was I was at a conference at the University of Chicago today and they mentioned that all the nations of signed up to the Paris accords even\nEven though President Trump has said he's going to withdraw you know a lot of\nIt is kind of a universal thing um but uh you know the uh the members are not living up to their to their uh commitments it's very very tough when you need to uh\nTo impose a things on your nation and you and you are\nUh have to impose costs on renewable energy and also there's there was this big demand that the world set up the United nations they wanted a hundred billion dollar annual climate payment to go from the wealthy nations to the developing nations a hundred billion annually quite a big amount\nAnd a year and has that has completely collapsed a matter of fact the guy who was head of that just resigned this last summer and with the ... with the United states cutting its commitment or they're nowhere near that they're down about four or five billion dollars a year\nWasn't there a scandal amongst some of the scientists who were ... you know pro man made climate change with the emails and things like that\nYeah the east the climate gate what's called the University of East Anglia back in two thousand nine\nOr they don't know who ... somebody released thousands of emails either end in sight or or a hacker and these emails showed some very bad behavior uh there were a a guy that uh\nUh we're saying I'm a don't tell anyone that the United kingdom has a freedom of Information Act or there are people are racing emails uh there were people a trunk hating or data or there were people trying to interview a to influence the peer review process [noise]\n[noise] I'm just I'm just not a tough situation you know and and my thought is by interpretation is that that the scientists that he's saying and by the way this was a this was the primary I mentioned before the climate research unit which is the primary keeper of the world's temperatures\nAre these folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and convince the world if you think the world is going down the wrong track\nUh they were pulling any means to try and do that but they were they were following very very poor a scientific or procedures\nOkay let's go to the phones now Eric truck driving in Indiana hello Eric\nUrge either right or is that my child guy as everybody do you just scared the heck out of my guests [laughter] Iraq\nTo hey buddy or many many years ago the founder of coast to coast art bell and his buddy ... Streever wrote a book\nCalled the coming global superstar and that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow I well I was wondering was\nOr is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with Yellowstone popping the cork in law and Wyoming in Kentucky or is it very possible that the ban in both of those movies could very well happen\n[noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that folks Cain although I understand there's a big went under their\nYoung they call during the day after\nTomorrow is based on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slowed down in the Gulf Stream which is part of a the a a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water or the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sink Senate it flows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic Indian on the Pacific the\nThe theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us in the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise]\nYeah okay this whole thing right\nLet's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll act and they'll make it\nStill doing the whole thing well okay go ahead John\nYeah ah my dad who ah who quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're\nTalking about wind field ... when I when I was living in\nOregon okay\nAnd I used to drive by the wind feels that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and there was plenty for black blue flame\nYou know they were were voting off the methane\nGas known for where he now why go to put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know Chris city they'll\nCome back and they said no no no it's going to cost to my kid have anything out now that can't be the only land you know in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Want to go why hasn't been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some places matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nOh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills\nA but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext on let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having Steve von Loor\nSpoken to spoken to him several times are\nHurting on many shows and he has a breath of fresh air and inside and that accuracy or there is one point that the other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends Steve\nNot to make the same mistake that these are climate gain hope servers are are using a ...

I'm Sorry two billion Peebles it's quite a few of those are those are United Nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using one point three billion a papal so two

know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a dimension or perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware is a\nGlobal elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and dumb what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations a news article scientists\nThat is not the proper word the word is abrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years this is the aerosol injections\nThey're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this a lot of\nGeneral assembly heart technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it\nFirst of all any time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite maps that we used to the many years ago we're seeing an animated cartoon but\nThere's a site I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm friends hurricanes tropical storms low pressure is on coming directly into California and they're being blocked and is being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up\nThey're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power\nAnd can hit the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricanes they can stall hurricanes\nThey can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex what's having our with our weather\nLook when only hear about it in the news Luhansk in Steve's reaction Bruce\nBruce said something I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge or has not been anything done on a large scale that's something I'd have to look look into it further\nLet's take one more call or maybe two if we have some time in and tell ... go ahead [laughter]\nOh well let's go higher that man just said is exactly right I'm One of these conservatives it happens to believe that the weather pattern is being Gail engineered the camp trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George shit recently at gentleman on his show\nTalking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guys and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the earth blotting out son well people have race so much heck issues ward heck\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the game trails well now the weather's going to get real radical now they have the they had the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's it's to the point now you can go to Wall Street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want hurricanes if they want to intensify the hurricane through the eight of heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geoengineering of the soil and the crops which is in destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct\nAnd if they go away you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea didn't man ever come up with man is not smart enough to harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing\nDonald Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham men they want they were doing stripping away all of them industrial nations away distributing it into the pockets of the global elites\nAnd meanwhile China said so they're with their skies completely with pollution not paying a dime into it either is Russia but the United states of America was going to play the whole to pay a whole tab now I don't blame a Trump one bit I agree with that I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he's somebody had to wear out of time Steve and ed

had an encounter with big foot uh my first ah\nA realization of the character came with um the Patty film probably somewhere in the late sixties early seventies ha ha and um I've had other encounters in my life but not with the ah the hairy men\nAnd after I saw that I said to myself oh my God this type of thing is roaming around North America and uh I'm like other people who thought it was a hoax and still do to this day\nI was a I was sold on it from the beginning I just said to myself this thing is real it's out there and are these fellows or have seen it and got in on film\nYou convince people William are seen something very strange and unusual they're not making up these stories something out there and there's some kind of creature\nI have no doubt about it George and based on um the encounters and the testimonies\nIf you think about it what would make a husband and wife Silber home that day love if they hadn't had something that scared the multiple ... uh what makes a hunter gun collection and vowed that he'll never enter into the woods again\nAfter having encountered a something in the forest [noise] uh to me is everybody lying is everybody out of their minds I don't think so I think these people are having real uh encounters or in most cases they've been frightened half out of there were [noise]\nAnd uh for as far as everybody else is concerned everything's a hoax right from the get go\nWell will come up with a number of different theories on what we all think big foot might be we'll take calls next hour I've got to ask you this because I was raised Catholic what is a Catholic blogger where do you do\n[noise] well basically I uh talk about the things that I Believe a troubling mankind and uh try to get to the bottom of the heart of the matter if

too volumes of books on amazing but I was afraid that you sent me you're originals\nWell here's what happened in Georgia in this kind of humor is um when you produce had contacted me uh I had an order in four foot they're actually made to order on Amazon\nAnd I had given all of the copies out I had and I had I mean I I had it in order and fruit punch bowl [laughter] either that or I have nothing to

do you think\n[noise] well [noise] ah my my own personal theories are on that or to fold\nA number one in the physical realm this is a creation this is a creature that's out there uh how many of them all day or we don't know nobody knows\nBut based on the fact that they leave prints from both hands in the seat\nA according to some testimonies they bleed having been shot\nA and they die as well getting into a little later on a which to me makes him a living breathing entity like any other creature a B the greater small on the planet\nA I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart any way that they do exist and that people have every walk of life or in countering them\nUh having said that\nUh we will get into a little story later that out of hand picked for the coast audience\nA and I have a
