announce narrative caught to production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely not nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nSolar in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J.

A. dot com or call one eight six\nSix eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five [noise]\nCan't buy a um six forty more stimulating talk [noise]\n\nWe are back with Joyce color will take your calls this hour questions and readings Joyce do you see or ... or on people quote Casey did\nNot always sometimes yes if I'm stressed I probably will not see them the best way to learn to see or is this just look beyond the person or in a dimly lit room he'll say something and then over a period of time increase\nBut ours are very very important and understanding what they mean if the colors and the\nShaped very very important charge so can you see our insurance you\nKnow I I Can't do the do you remember the under Casey story where he was getting on an elevator he could see or as and he looked at all these people in the elevator he couldn't see any or is it scared the heck out about how she didn't go in the elevator and the elevators the cable stamped on the people died\nYeah you gotta look Casey [laughter] oh my God [laughter] absolutely George George reminder as a psychic\nWhere do you get your I'll call the power where'd you get it from\nI don't think it's powered I oh God that we're really trying to think a lot of people say that and I think on the God as the ultimate power but the rest of us tune in and I tried to help people I've had a radio show four more years I can remember\nAnd it's actually afraid to call in I'm very happy to it and that's the question whether we have the power from we all get our energy from life for us we get it from God at the moment we take our first trip to retake last breath so the energy for the youth and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people listen to the show love animals joys and many of them owned them what happens when that pet that animal passes on\nA great question our so connected to our animals [noise]\nWell when my cat died we were so close they came to me that night and he said you know mom I'm fine I don't want you to worry about me\nWhen I lost my dog he came to me and a little hospital bed the night he died he was lying on his side I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I pass but I'm okay now I Know it's so crazy they called me mom they really think that your mother\nSo animals and that's to your question George Will either go to a dimension of all animals all the years go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really cut and dried rules about where animals go\nBut they do have a relief as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but\nAs I I don't want people to think that suicide is that right you're supposed to go when you're supposed to go and you know so a suicides are all different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicides\nGeorge Burns\nYes don't do it [laughter]\nNo you'd asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or Joyce I Do have that ability to feel\nSad if feeling is it's like Claire than you a sense and you're feeling that's very intuitive so you can feel it presses or like when you're with and there are fields of is that what you mean George\nYes oh wow that's impressive\nSo if you're with the press and who's not that good to step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I call psyche a\nVampire shy or but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I Try to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories\nWhere they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but I get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of healing and that's terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates or the ... billion a year and then I just want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate Joyce\nSure that'll be grave however you run a judge I think\nThat's the one that started with Christian Tampa Bay Florida Christians are born on October ten on October sixteen Nineteen Seventy October sixteen Nineteen Seventy Hey Chris welcome\nOh thank you happy birthday [laughter] I don't have much more than one\nOkay so ... ten sixteen so you have a really wonderful news cycle beginning but it has to do with creativity you have a question Chris\nOh I'm very much a creature routine and I just wanted to give their routines no break his routine get boring after a while\nYeah but here in Tampa that area is not boring it all to shift their and Tampa is a terrific area and do you ever do any kind of painting or art work\nI'm I'm a I used to I I Do some writing now\nYes well you have Martin guard go at the time you were born and that tells me that your your extremely intuitive and you're very caught up with details when you paint you shouldn't be painting again that's very therapeutic pie crust\nAnd that'll bring and wonderful spirit energy as well so you have a lot of intuitive abilities you have enough note in ... so I Know you can read people very quickly so I thank you very much for calling it if you have a question\nNo that was there but thank you very much\nThan okay Thanks Chris Russia last year and there's nothing wrong with being in a routine is their Joyce\nNo but you know I sometimes have become really really discouraged and you say they have to be something else so at that point you have to it's very very hard to get out of Iraq really difficult for the most difficult things on the planet at that point you have to force yourself to do something you really don't want it to like whatever that might be\nA ... you know just just do it and go out and you said your energy will change change your energy though and change your life and tried prayer and meditation they know what God I'm stuck\nAnd bring me something fresh and somebody know spirit will work with you\nDo you work with people teaching them a psychic abilities\nTrue or not only that but with the new website was starting which I mentioned before which is on my website we're going to be training people going to be helping them and uh in in all my books I say the same thing you don't have to pay a psychic or anything you can do this yourself\nIt's a God given talent that we all have just pay attention to your feelings listen to what you're hearing and stop doubting yourself and stopped saying if my imagination\nYou know when you get that late night phone number going you're going to get a lot of insomniacs calling you\n[laughter] well that's okay [laughter] I'm probably up [laughter] to me I Hope it's twenty four seven lines so you can call in\nTo the ... got a question

to coast to coast George ... with you Robert boss was with us almost three years to the ... the day Robert Moss has been a dream traveler since doctors pronounced him politically dead in a hospital in test mania when he was three years old\nFrom his experiences and many worlds he created his school back to dreaming his original\nSince this is a modern dream work with the ancient some Monica and mystical practices war you're into the realms beyond the physical though he leads popular workshops all over the planet including three you're training for teachers of active dreaming an online courses for the shift network\nA noted the author he's got a number of books the most recent mysterious realities Robert welcome back my friend\nGood to be a dream and were waving with George Foy\nLooking forward to this would this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nWell first of all my mother took me from Melbourne, Australia where we live in West distributed to see her on the opera singer and the psychic medium of known mean caliber\nAnd she looked in the tea leaves the old fashioned way and she saw might that she didn't tell us she went out and came back like face well she was right that went to in ... Maine yet when my father had being censored than the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died in hospital the doctor told my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that\nThat is a lot of the first experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books I must tell you George I don't remember anything not sure what happened when I was out of my body age three members rather hot living on this afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\nWas I died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions and the sister appendectomy in an operating room in that time I remember what happened it sounds like the classic and the to begin with I found that the feel they're looking at the the the the scalp all of the surgeons not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to loosen up talk a fountain pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate wanted to do with an old marine nine year old kid would want to do go on the ride for could go into some addresses\nSo I got into Luna Park age nine in my Astros body and I'm drawn into I didn't know that goes straight and maybe\nI'm drawn into another world and where I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that right and I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bed back eventually out the seeming to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked\nTo find myself in the body of a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding their worlds beyond the physical you know nine years old who do you talk about is you try to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something like this person who could explain\nTo me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same\nAnd sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings Michael dissociation was an ability to travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily and an understanding that there will be on the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army and moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you all the things that kept me going is it amongst mine this book companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and a face\nTo come and sit on my dad and say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know go and they'll like you and one day all day you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubbing younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe're time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious or active treat me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to her why it's a self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nIt means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled Paolo will for example\nBut we're leading parallel live this isn't as weird as at some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from other living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams of venting conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding that solar consciousness survived physical test so this is a pretty pretty important area\nAh so the idea of dreaming travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as they'll bubble up from the U.S no subconscious and that's all that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my enclosed glued but loving family members are ancestors of spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind science tells us about we get into the condom information field to get into\nThe ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also proud of this is that we are definitely a time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes them down will notice that they dream events before they happen and one function of time travel we see the possible future we can ... the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we also traveled into the past from this my mother lives you learned about connections with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods in\nThe multi dimensional universe so this is the key to the U.S and understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experience as pop and freedom travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely Furman experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who work with me and they're giving me permission to use this story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of so since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect this to the source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like\nYou can talk to the nature of the ancestors with the big self all the highest cells so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience because dreams\nCan be the voice of conscience and dreams can be a ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions in attitudes from the data and more objective perspective than we can manage for ourselves an indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your ...\nOh your dream sold in fact has gone missing and probably the scariest story of my book mysterious reality is that the one code dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what it might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience I've lost the sense of a deep up ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning a Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step persist the sharing a dream of a story that makes it sound you can get it done in minutes you get some help with feedback and you're guided tours action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our opinions I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it let out so the rushed out sleep by the alarm clock but then he kept job of deal with the family\nWe think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention to those in between ... states of consciousness you between sleep in the wake\nThat's a good time to catch it means good time to talk on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed to 'cause they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that cutters\nSometimes we close off our dreams because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slam the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nFrom which we can access time passed future or power low so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences of what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we're leading a power live this come very interesting when you begin to look at\nGive some lessons you might have been in power little life that you can apply and you present my and how to avoid things went wrong and not at all the power alone I\nThink it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you love the best time will be a guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the life situations the people in far flung places feel proud of your multi dimensional family\nI'm a bit of a an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience\nBut we are connected to dramas being lived in other places in time and that for certain point of view it's\nAll going on now I wouldn't be doing what I I'm not doing not found myself connected with an Anglo Irish men who came to the American colonies\nSeventeen hundred ... Indian very well I found myself dreaming into his life that I had to study his life\nAnd hold on for a second Robert we're at the break but we'll be back with more in a moment of coast to coast they\nPass on that when they break [noise]\nI'm Michael ... lie but from the ... twenty four hour news you're on the wrong changes made his regular saying this season debut as of late her in a game against the Portland TrailBlazers James May not sound like it but he said he was ... before the game the\n... mall is excited about playing a game you know love and ah [noise] the opportunity for ... is a very\nJames has been done a four year a hundred and fifty four million dollar deal with the Lakers is regular season staples Centre day do you will be Saturday against the Houston Rockets oh the game tonight\nLike his last the national institutes of health has sent half of its remaining researched Jim store retreat in Louisiana to relax in retirement and I aged director Dr Francis Collins says the gyms were important participants and HIV and hepatitis research studies\nWe owe it to them to give them a chance to live out their final years in a place that's really supportive of the kinds of things that chimps value which is social groupings and being outside and being able to climb\nAllen says each of the two hundred gyms left will be evaluated to make sure it's healthy enough to travel to the sanctuary the end I H A\nDecided stopped using chimpanzees worth researching twenty fifth teach political experts say famous pimp Dennis Hopper as expected to win and about assembly race in a few weeks despite the fact that he's dead of night Tuesday at Seventy two and a handful of Brussels including the famous ... does need when the ... county will nominate another Republican\nTo fill the vacancy mega millions jackpot I surpassed expectations that had been predicted the prize might reach nine hundred million bucks but it's already reached nine hundred Seventy which makes it the second largest jackpot in history next drawing is tonight traffic from the uncles Ocala hundreds have extended working in Burbank\nSouth Bend side of the far western into the one's thirty four three left lanes coming off as soon as going to wrap up as late as five you're bunch stuff through there on the north on fire leaving Griffith Park cutting into that were being stretched by both once every four to Alameda to left wing shut down\nThat's going into five you're slowing down coming off of Colorado will lesion parts south side of the one tenant academy road you've a brush fire on the right children fire crews actually block the academy's offer ever tried to put this out that's definitely causing a little\nGolfers lock as you move to on the main line and it costs a gym on the Ralph seven you time traffic lines ... five hundred five thousand three give us a good news in Ontario sixty ...

I\nDon't you at lunchtime I sit down at the airport by have a beer on the straight and I have a beer when I can see how many red faced man next to me as you looked like a fellow you'd like to hear a story and I look at the interest he introduces himself he's a former cop he's a former detective from the East Bay area all interesting\nHe looks at me and he says Robert he's let my name I have to share this with someone I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nAnd I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it's her but I cold\nShe'd never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head thing he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story it's a very great story I mean that introduces whole themes about going to the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my call them to something\nCalled us to a certain place might even be an age of the sudden 'cause that's what he but\nAs I'm telling you that it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and that these examples proliferate so\n... you know what it how it works is that the the the attitude of the energy you are carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life shaping wanted waking for waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life\nTo pause and check your attitude check or to play you know when you're in a soundtrack\nCheck what you're saying to yourself drop the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nIs there anything physical about this I mean I Know you need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think there's a good body is very important that the first of all I mean scientists are telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to math uh into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter of reality as a dense of consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is\nGoing on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time\nMy blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it's surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hits a gosh are my blood is boat again that's why you're living in pants\nAnd after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen ... the white queen screams\nBefore she picks her finger says she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the forward took place and the doctor said my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating symptoms because but I couldn't possibly reporter people think I was looted you well you know I think so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know thing\nWe know what the bleep we don't know that we know you're not Bobby outside medic response was me pick up things from a distance from other people and we feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's part of the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nActed dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way you're going to take action that will impact\nYour life and bring some elite energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it it's almost the method of loose the dreaming you called a ... medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of ... will do to dream adventure is to start out loose that didn't stay lose what does that need it means that we use shut medic coming in the workshop\nOr we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay the romance an adventure steel industry let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stop the stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's grandma or someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream yet another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try like state\nTreated sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images that rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the themes that will come to you the pool to footloose and dreaming and finally\nActive agreement with the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we ... how to look for the outlook for signs of both in the world around you so this is also a program on a method all attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams and film the misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think that don't think the dreams in themselves to ever deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems that are floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to is that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on its own round you might find the behind something that's scaring worrying\nYou and your dream is a power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not the ... but a rush to interpret according to narrow understanding what dreams is about can be very misleading\nYou got to Robert we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and take phone calls and continue chatting about your latest work mysterious realities\nFind out more about tonight's

deposit the shape your view of reality and he was one of those are always understood the one of the key things about dreaming is that it gives the U.S had the ability to understand what happens to

briefly one more thing about him\nAnd his relevance to this book in my approach to everything\nHe came late in his life to the conclusion that one of the things going on in dreams is that we live I'm

hundred dollar silver production nuts I'd got Kevin dumb ever to blur capital with me today so let's ask him Kevin how are ya\nGreat George thanks yeah in two thousand and two silver was four dollars announced narrative caught to production we predicted she'll would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely not nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nWith the times silver was trading near its production costs and industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nAnd why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nSolar in fact China alone it expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the place to go down\nYou know I guess not but could super reach higher than a hundred dollars announced\nOr if you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announce to reach us all time high so we think is a one hundred dollars is well within reach\nOne could that happen over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential and silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything that you can set out to listeners so they can find out more about a hundred dollar sober\nWe do George when I make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar and why experts these over rising to a hundred dollars and out the report the twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even for just came out with a report saying China was leading the way with solar and that in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip coal gas in nuclear combined\nLet's get Lee or sky high silver report in some fascinating report and don't miss out on the ... revolution call not to get your copy it's a twenty dollar value free with no obligation call one eight hundred\nTo nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\nOh I went to a place called camp film about clothes in the nineties and they had material than says that we're absolutely mind blowing and those people have since they're no longer with us for people who conduct a than says but I don't materials ... than says that we're just unbelievable\nThing how do you know the real joy as opposed to being some some ...\nYeah but you know it's very very hard to tell the difference it's very strange I Can't really differentiate what's real and what this and\nBecause the the the frauds are very good at what they do\nThat's the thing is you know what I watch shows on TV about uh how magicians are flowing in public and I say this is so bad because it's so good at this and it makes all of us who are legitimate look really really bad\nAnd it looks like we're all doing trickery of some ... I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not you should not ask the president who's receiving reading\nAny questions I mean it shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that why you're here you're able to tell them that's the first ... the legitimacy of what you are we saving\nI Am I an orange yellow or on a few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers who are others who are critical of him say that he's just a great magician and and I told him I says hurry I got to tell you if you're a magician\nAnd you're doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons a magically you if you're a magician I Can't see the trick\nOr you know we're we're you do to switch or anything like that ah I've looked at videos I've slowed him down a gun frame by frame\nYou can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he's probably the real deal I Believe he started out doing magic trick that many of these wonderful psychic do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there\nAs a they're six cents kicks in and they start to a legitimately and then it kind of well close together you can't tell the difference but it's wonderful that you're you're falling down frames and did you learn anything from that we were able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and blocks haven't started in years\n[laughter] trying to say that when you were growing up you didn't magic trick or you're involved with magic\nAnd did a little magic when I was a kid I mean I wasn't I was really good at that but uh you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven\nUh which really I think steered me into the field that I mean now I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce [laughter]\nYes I Know but you you're really amazing because\nI find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be um crafts and I'll say well I was a trick I was visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific and\nThere there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking so restrictive limiting to higher consciousness go into fourth dimension and be on let's all move forward\nAnd it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and other financial interests are very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because we're supposed to be in growing in a consciousness that I kind of a\nDigging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah you do now Georgia we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers and listeners your birth month ... days I\nHave a birthday and at first name possible shortly thereafter they about I'm a fellow man a lot about love and loss\nOf ... and trying to keep each call to about a minute nap for ... if you can talk to him out his because so many were cut it short would try to get right in there as quickly as you believe in reincarnation\n[noise] I don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly have the experience as we have\nIf we weren't more and more than one time and either on the earth or another dimension I think people can be here the first time because they've been in other dimensions other\nPlanets I I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say try believe in reincarnation as say a variation of it and other churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and the disorders\nA psychic is there anything out there that bothers you the the the you feel very strange about\nWhat you see a very strange about like um\nAre you picking on them or you picking up weird feelings or anything like that\nBut I don't like going to cemeteries I don't like the energy there and people who lose loved ones and they go to the cemetery frequently are pulling that person back to their grave site and they they really want to go into like they want to be elevated themselves\nAnd yet the grieving process is really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know that grief\nBut you don't dwell on it you said you know I Love this person and good luck God Bless you and try to release them and\nAnd I always think about them right here and\nThink about them because we're still well it's like I Want to like God Bless you I Love you thank you for what we had together and let them go I'm going to the cemetery is very bad ah you know my my parents were big cemetery ... hours as I was growing up is that a good we're going [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like funerals\nExactly but my parents were part of the generation that went to the cemetery it's a lot you know and I found myself a cemetery is a great deal growing up and at one point my parents were pointing to a Muslim as we were driving through Greenwood cemetery and my mom said she I think we should get one of\nThose and I think they were well at the time yeah I I'm thinking to myself I really don't want to live here don't play no they're not going to stay here in back\nOf the thing is I started crying and I think what's wrong with you I I don't want to live here and they said no no no for my mother explain more about that to me and that was very enlightening\nAnd I thought it was like a house on the I thought they were going crazy people identify with my dog and my bike\nI Love it there are a joy to stay with us we'll come back and we'll take phone calls questions rejoice Keller the psychic and if you want to reading we will

best way to learn to see or is it just looked beyond the person or in a dimly lit room you'll see something and then over a period of time it will increase\nBut are as a very very important and understanding what they mean is the colors and the\nShape are all very very important in charge so can you see our history\nNo I Can't do the do you remember the Casey story where he was getting on an elevator yeah he could see ... and he looked at all these people in this elevator he couldn't see any ... scared and they haven't caught about how he didn't go in the elevator and the elevators the cable snapping the people died\nYeah you gotta love case the bad guy so absolutely jerk reminder\nAs a psychic where do you get your I'll call it power where you get it from\nI I don't think it's powered a guy that ... where it really is they're trying to think a lot of people say that and I think on the guy has the ultimate power but the rest of us tune in and I tried to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's absolutely free to call in I'm very happy to her\nAnd that's why she went and got the power from we all get our energy from its ally for us we get it from God at the moment we take our first breath until we take out last breath so the energy is after all of us to use and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people who listen to the show love animals joys in many of them owned them what happens when that pets that animal passes on\nThat's a great question our connected to our animals [noise]\nWell you know when my cat died we were so close they came to me is that night and he said you know mom I'm fine [laughter] and I don't want you to worry about me\nAnd when I lost my dog he came to me and a little hospital bed the night he died and he was lying on his side he said I I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I pass but I'm okay now I Know it's so crazy they call me mom they really think that your mother\nSo animals and that's your question try to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go but they\nDo have a relief as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but as I I don't want people to think that two sides that right you're supposed to go and you're supposed to go\nAnd you know so a suicides are all different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicides\n... very sad\nYes don't do it [laughter] I\nKnow you asked me if I see or is and I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have done ... ...\nIs feeling the threat class sent you a sense and you're feeling that's very intuitive so you can feel presses or like when you're with in there or field is that what you mean George\nYes oh wow that's impressive\nSo if you're with the person who is not that good to step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I called psyche a\nVampire ... but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I Try to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories\nWhere they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but I get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary [noise] so that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... a month and year and then if they want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate Joyce\nSure that'll be grave however you run a judge that's that's\nThe one that started with Christian Tampa Bay Florida Chris is ah the born on October ten on October sixteen Nineteen

understanding\nThere will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about this you try to talk it out that the\nMedication you're hallucinating or something that could explain to me what

remember of childhood was the big man and a lot of white hair and a face\nTo come and sit on my that is a backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and one day all day you can't kill your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older brother younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe're time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the out of conscious or active treat me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleaders counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to her why it's a self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities of dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nIt means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond out often read dimension of reality in two of them will we traveled a pillow will for example\nBut we're leading parallel live this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis for you and I live in right now it was a medic parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find out so for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from Rockville living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams of venting conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solar consciousness survived physical depth and it was a pretty pretty important area\nAh so the idea of dreaming travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up\nSnow subconscious and that's all that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my enclosed cleared the loving family members are ancestors a spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body and the brain we get into that whole field of non local mine but science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely a time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes them down will notice that they dream events before they happen as one function of time travel we see the possible future we couldn't read hosts the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we also traveled into the past from this life and promote the lives you've learned about our connections with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods in\nThe multi dimensional universe so this is the key to the U.S hand understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experience as pop and freedom travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who work with me and they're giving me permission to use their story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers them but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect this to a deep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream of St believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest soul so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams\nCan be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions in attitudes from a better and more objective perspective than we can manage for ourselves\nAn indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing and probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities local unquote agreement takers\nAnd which takes a look at what they might begin to meet and if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience\nHave lost the sense of a deep up ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive you know I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding our son to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we remember something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about is how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially or what he can bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step process to sharing a dream of a story that makes it sound you can get it done and minutes you get some help with feedback in your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our opinions I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get jobs do deal with the family we think that we should lie in nothing bad and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness between sleep and wake that's a good time to catch it means is a good time to talk on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dreams because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams tell sometimes this is very interesting\nBut we are connected to dramas being lived in other places in time I look for certain point\nOf view it's all going on now I wouldn't be doing what I I'm not doing but I'm not found myself connect with an Anglo Irish men who came to the American colonies\nIn the Seventeen hundreds ...
