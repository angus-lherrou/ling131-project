is coming okay ... thanks George George nor next\nWhen we continue after ten o'clock by the way we mentioned a another high speed chase this one with the DUI suspect and the cops actually called off that pursuit\nJust to update you and once that pursuit was called off them a DUI suspect actually stopped at a McDonald's\nGot some food and then went to a motel six and that was the last place that he was when I say you know it's not like there was a standoff in the parking lot he literally walked into a motel six and\nIs presumably you know in his room at the motel six now and you'll see their overhead shots of the cops now looking at his car\nThey're looking at different cars in the parking lot looks to me like they're trying to identify the cars in\nBurbank or or north of Burbank where is this is a I think it's in Sylmar Sylmar out there that Iraq's for oh rex ... products for and\nSo they seem to have found his car and others found as location and the motel six is right next to the McDonalds so he did all of this and like you know one clean block and he's\nHe's not there with the vehicle anymore so you've just got the cops they're sort of circulating and trying to figure out what to do next now I think one of them is going into the motel six\nAnd again this is a DUI suspect I presume if they want to take it for you know that's a felony evading isn't it when you're a when you're avoiding the cops like that\nAnd I I don't know if you decide you see a that this was also a ride share vehicle\nWas it really is that it's a lift All right [laughter]\n... what is it likely as a a Toyota Camry yeah [laughter] oh oh okay oh oh got older and got a bit down for the night or the motel say 'cause yeah making their Monday if it was good [laughter] I think the cops are are I Know you wouldn't believe what happened to me\nYeah yeah this this may not a I think micro should pay will be updating this as the next hour show goes by I just can't believe the cops are going to leave this alone primarily because they're around his car right now\nSo I mean why would they be spending so much time around the car where if it weren't for the fact that they plan on following up and now they're three black and white there yeah\nI wanted to mention that this kid who was Thirteen Years old\nAnd he's an ... a young man young man from ... he's Thirteen year old a bitten by a shark in that San Diego area\nHe is expected to make a full recovery and I wanted to share that good news with you they say that\nThis there's Thirteen year old who was airlifted to a hospital he was attacked by and eleven foot shark\nAt a beach in San Diego over the weekend he was diving for lobsters when he was bitten multiple times by an approximately eleven for chart so he was looking to\nGrab some lobsters and he got grabbed by another predator\nAnd we always forget as human beings we're not the only other were not the only predators out there right I'm\nThree good Samaritans rushed to the injured boys aid transport him to the shore on a kayak he was airlifted to the hospital and he's in serious condition but he is expected to make a full recovery so that is the word\nOn the Thirteen year old who was bitten and attacked by a shark in the San Diego area\nI uh\nI'm open for questions here at the very end of the show I'd like to begin a new segment where I take questions to stab anybody have any thing John do you have anything everything okay how's began life [laughter]\n\n[noise] well I wasn't expecting that but uh it's great I Love it I recommend it I don't push it but\nI Would really it's it's a really great thing once you get rid of the dairy\nReally man it just yeah it sets you free was that the hardest to to go I think it's the heart of it not because it's hard to give it up because there's so many substitutes but it's just in so many things that you know what I mean so it's just like all these cream sauces and all the rest is like\nIn you know you're talking about butter and ... you think about all things in a butter so it's just harder to avoid that's all\nI'm but I don't miss it no because they're just too many substitutes show\nOr a top speed of a wild

the humans\nBecause of this heavy ion radiation in space we've known this for a long time but NASA conducted a recent experiment George talking about what might happen when mice were inducted with heavy doses of radiation simply\nYeah potentially could cause cancer and the G I tracked but not to sound depressing the human factors is obviously so important not just the propulsion system\nAnd continuing George with what's going on in space the first interstellar asteroid about a year ago we reported here on the radio [noise]\nThis is an object is about eight hundred feet in diameter it's officially known as over more mullah Hawaiian for scout what has this object supposedly George comes from another star system strong and those are seeing it moving away from us now in the good thing I gather\nBut it almost looks flat like a pancake it rotates in about eight and a half hours but it's one of his are actually tracking its path and here's what they think they know it may have come from a red dwarf star simply known as a starting the catalog very complicated name called H.

I Want to tell people it's affecting anyone who's born around November second or third\nOf any year so those people are going to get an extra dose of Venus over the next several weeks which is focus on love relationship creative artist street social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sense it does\nFeel that way um well you know part of it might be one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there they're they're amazed because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information\nAnd so from the political realm it when people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports and need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they are being reported like liquor these split hour after hour\nAnd I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had this whole thing about social networking we're you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there and so\nIt's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere and I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me are back in July and you're always popping in on New Year's day with us and right can you chat to chart the rest of the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] [noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today is October one\nAnd you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you can take a look at the whole month of November by looking at midnight in in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nAll be on the air with everybody\nWell yeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always a rising and the sun isn't Capricorn at the bottom of the charge because it's midnight and so\nThere you have to feed and all the other plants like for instance midnight New Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional positive war will go into its own fine actually late on December thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars\nAnd um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects that are more marshal the son with Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations lotta blocks coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand nine team for the world\nWhy does it work mark why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this was what the old idea exactly and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness the pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words\nEverything depends on something being born at a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb\nIf the indoor court still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that it's free they taking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually used to leave America's Choice because it was a first breath\nWere were saying the gift wedding when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that chart but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon and the various planet it's not that they're making things happen from outer space\nIt's that whatever is born a person\nA president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time uh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what does that say about the potential\nOf my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers ... new one great bear enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com and we come back in the moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do we want some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month day in your birth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nJust the time making more accurate you are you\nWell look I could ... if somebody said to me I Know one on board month a in here you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month and year I could do anything for that person not as exactly among do it\nBecause timing allows us all kinds of things is a sunrise birth is is it near new and his son said is it\nA midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because in twenty four hours most of the pilots are gonna be in the ... they're going to be in the same signs with the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go\nHalf of the time and so the moon has a lot to do with our instincts are moods even reincarnation and looking back who may have been ordered the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has a lot to do with personality the sun is more of the character and kind of a life force\nAnd a connection and a little bit more spirituality but so polarizing sign which is the sunrise in the east\nThat as the window to the world kind of on the highest level of spirituality\nIn and tell me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done\nEver yeah in this field well unfortunately I well there's two things I'm studying the chart for when President Kennedy died okay because I learned so much about astrology and I was there well I wasn't there I was there when it happened twenty two when I got into you know the other is on the nuclear and an Atomic Energy area\nLet's talk more about that and take phone calls in just a moment right here on the

yeah\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd Georgian already back could you hear more to learn or the astrologer with us mark how long would it take someone just study astrology if they wanted to become an astrologer\nWell I\nOkay it took me one year was kind of like my graduate school where I was twenty two I was studying metaphysics people like Rudolph Steiner George ... G of a a spends the ... the ... Ellis Bailey teachings and so on\n'em and I found my mentor Dane Roger who is one of the great astrologers of twenty century and he had studied not just the strategy but philosophy psychology and metaphysics of thought so I read\nAll of his books and kind of memorized everything and the reason which if their students out there\nUh the planet mercury which who've mind thinking communication at the time of his birth and Pisces was exactly at the same spot where mine was and I knew what his shirt was and when I started reading this book that you asked me that psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and off and underrated was in the same spot at any rate I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than just an astrology charts they could they have to learn what's called transits of progression with a plan to keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince you since you've been doing this ... and ... what was it that got you interested in it and invent something happened\nUm I started going medical to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have\nStudied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into ah all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh which is part of a psychic we're thing that you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home and just before getting home I stopped in the book store and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned TV for astrology the space age science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo\nPredicates all these great physicist and all these people have studied\nA more of a straw tummy telescope scale layer and so on they were all ... but when the biographers would write about is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault the world's going to the\nPhony thing of astrology because the the biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand you know why why was the greatest scientists before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nNow how could that possibly be what what's wrong with a guy\nBut what they didn't realize is who is the science it was taught in the universities of Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations perjure Egypt realm great you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're\nGoing to make it work this hour mark so let's go under the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's birth the December twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay born at one forty two in the afternoon\nIn Jersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know what I'm doing is just for people out there are not putting in my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of get that information pretty quick in\nAnd you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean ah if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell that we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\nYou're good welcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay thank you okay great you you're on with Mark Warner of given mark your birthday to you know your time go ahead mark\nWell if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say\nA lot of court this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an aries moon and tours rising and he's born very close to her first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour\nPeople don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an aries moon\nComing from other lives and like instinctively this individual has a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in other lives particularly in the last life and now with the sun and Capricorn kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of\nA this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and he should be make sure\nUh he's strengthens his immune system and stays healthy but that um he doesn't become pessimistic about things um but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\n... you have a question to\nUh yeah well what if I'm not I don't know [laughter] well if you're not held on now\nAgain you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on and other people didn't good on um go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics\nAstrology but the power of numbers numerology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I study that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing we're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess how it would work out of why we with the like an Einstein or Gandhi are different people and mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there's a whole field of esoteric astrology there's a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the Nostradamus clock trains and Edgar Casey\nThere's a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep\nPsychic lead people who who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else\nSo that's all part of things and definitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and\nOur incarnations like in the chart we're looking at that like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan a higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun million the planets and the configuration that we have\n... ... reincarnation I asked her logically speaking yeah we're the born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that will who they born during the same time period\nOh no no no ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing you know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought\nPeople would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I have read my life [noise]\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the

I thought it was and this was a pie and Marie I'm Carla yeah yeah oh sorry well that's okay\nNo hair bear with me Carla finally you got something wrong [laughter] yeah I didn't hear one and then ah that's okay but Capricorn you know this is\nI Know so many people born with Capricorn so um my mother was a January eleventh baby so uh [noise] anyone born around ... eleven January twelve you know so you know a lot about that that vibration so one of the things\nFor Capricorn again a Saturn is there okay uh do you know anything much about astrology yourself myth or a little bit\nWell okay so ... I've been saying a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in that camp because then you're going to have once in a lifetime Pluto\nA movement toward your son and the next like year or two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that sign and fatter will then contact your son and then between two the Nineteen two thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force\nKind of a link to hire spirit so what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy authors or ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be art it could be music anything a hobby a craft an activity though that has deep and significant\nSo that you don't get down on yourself are worried or stressed out and so on that you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo and on the line with hold the trial which is flowing to your son to be an organizer this is what you've you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes where you've been nurse or a doctor or poor student or you\nKnow a libraries or things like that learning languages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong from other allies but the big things next couple of years\nSo it kind of deep seeded study penetrating into some kind of mysteries or involvements that like you stay really focused and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to your car loan next one may fourth Nineteen sixty nine may fourth Nineteen\nSixty nine or going out to California so who is with us welcome to the program so good\nYeah I think you are my question is about Korea or money and should I moved to a different state um uh when I was born in a quick city court\nYou know where are you okay ... what's the city how do you spell it who weighed city oh okay in Kuwait a scholarship and he's a well I'm just\nPutting six AM hairless he'd give me another time I'll put around sunrise ... do you know your time birth or no oh no okay no problem okay you said money where what state to live in\nWhich they deliver using Kelly right now\nOkay well first of all there is an even my website it's called global hotspots ... where I Do is part of mundane astrology but it's also individuals [noise]\nWe've there's been a science for forty plus years in astrology\nIt was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around from like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere on the planet to understand what's good and what isn't a California is\nAnd this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union has a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as a son signed Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tourist son signed tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where your earth wind and California's earth science\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you of mercury with Vesta\nWhich is one of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to do something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that\nAnd you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationery in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lima to NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously okay in in the near future um and because you're ... and it's home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection\nBut you want to learn more about mercury its retrograde the power of Venus which is your son signed ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there's a planet X out there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nIn fact uh see I have a whole thing about here is which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle which is on said no when President Trump took office that's an article on earth Aquarius news\nIt was very strong at his inauguration and has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half and therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto\nHave are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids and little plants like higher on the truck it's overpopulated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously not overwhelming

already back would you hear more Lerner the astrologer with us mark how long would it take someone to study astrology if they wanted to become an astrologer\nWill I\nOkay it took me one year was kind of like my graduate school where I was twenty two I was studying metaphysics people like root of Steiner George ... G of a a ... ... the Alice Bailey teachings and so on\n'em and I found my mentor Dane Roger who is one of the great astrologers of twenty century and he had studied not just the strategy but philosophy psychology and metaphysics thought so I read all of his books and kind of memorize everything and the reason which if their students out there\nOf the planet mercury which rules mind thinking communication at the time of his birth and Pisces was exactly the same spot where mine was and I knew what his shirt was when I started reading this book that you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and often underrated within the same spot but any rate I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than just an astrology charts they ... they have to learn what's called transits of progression where the planets keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince since you've been doing this and what was the ... got you interested in it and invent something happened\nUm I started going medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have\nStudied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into a all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of a psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home\nAnd just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned TV for astrology the basic science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo credit because all these great physicist and all these people that studied\nA more of astronomy telescope scale layer and so on they were all ... but when the biographers would write about is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault they were all went to the phony thing of astrology because the the biographers just thought it was\nFoolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand you know why why was the greatest scientists before noon and tries to Newton studying astrology\nNow how could that possibly be what what's wrong with the guy\nWith what they didn't realize is who is the science was taught in the universities of Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations perjure Egypt Rome great you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's birth the December twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay born at one forty two in the afternoon\nIn Jersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know what I'm doing is just for people out there are not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of get that information pretty quickly\nIn them and you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean ah if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell when we go Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\n... is good\nWelcome to the pro western your radio down a little bit okay thank\nYou okay great you you're on with mark Lerner of given mark your birth date you know your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say\nAh of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas man and tours rising and he's born very close to her first quarter of a I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour\nPeople don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an ... million coming from other lives and like instinctual early this individual has a lot of assertiveness and forceful and this and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in other allies particularly in the last life and now with the sun and Capricorn it's kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise up the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual sons so it's an extra kind of\nA this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and\nHe should be make sure he's strengthens his immune system and stays healthy that um he doesn't become pessimistic about things\nUm but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and [noise] uh has a good attitude about things\nDo you have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not healthy now well if you're not held on\nNow again you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on and other people didn't good on um go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics\nAstrology that the power of numbers in neurology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can you know make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I study that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess uh how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people in mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there's a whole field of esoteric astrology there's a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the ... trains and Edgar Casey\nThere's a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep\nPsychic lead people who who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else\nSo that's all part of things and definitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and sold and\nOr incarnations like in the chart we're looking at the like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of water a game plan a higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun moon and the planets and the configuration that we have\n... under ... reincarnation astrological you speaking yeah we're the born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that will were they born during the same time period\nOh no no no ... ... ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing you know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought people would reincarnate slowly like maybe once\nEvery century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had my life [noise]\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light worker kind of work at this stage um twenty first century\nMight come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from from a man and a woman that really being able to come into the world as north ... time to take advantage of astrological vibrations they're to me absolutely in\nOther words the sold the spirit comes in and chooses parents and family based on family karma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing went to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bring in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nPublic

I've been saying a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in that camp because then you're going to have once in a lifetime Pluto\nA movement towards your son and the next like year or two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that Simon Saturn will then contact your son and then between two the Nineteen two thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of linked to higher spirit so what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy authors or ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be art it could be music anything a hobby a craft and activity though that is deep in significant\nSo that you don't get down on yourself are worried or stressed out and so on that you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo in on the line called the trying which is flowing to your son so being an organizer this is what you you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes where you've been nurse or doctor were were a student or you know a libraries or things like that learning languages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong from other allies but the big things next couple of years\nSo it kind of deep seated study penetrating into some kind of mysteries or involvements that like you stay really focused and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to your Carlos next one may for Nineteen sixty nine may fourth Nineteen sixty nine or going out to California so\nWho is with us welcome to the program so good\nYeah I think you are my question is about Korea or money or should I moved to a different state um uh when I was born in a quick city court\nYou know were you okay ... what's the city how do you spell it who wait city oh okay in Kuwait a scholarship and he's a well I'm just\nPutting six AM here unless you give me another time I'll put around sunrise ... do you know your time birth or not I don't know okay no problem okay you said money\nYeah where what state to live and what's neat to the movies in Kelly right now\nOkay well first of all there is an even in my Web site it's called global hotspots ... where I Do this is\nPart of mundane astrology but it's also individuals'\nWe've there's been a science for forty plus years and astrology\nIt was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around from like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere on the planet to understand what's good and what isn't now California is\nAnd this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union has a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as a son signed Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tourist son signed tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where your earth wind and California's earth science\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you of mercury with Vesta which is one of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to you know something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that and you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have\nA a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationery in retrograde on friday in Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lyme into NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously\nOkay in in the near future um and because you're ... and it's home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection but you want to learn more about mercury its retrograde the power of Venus which is your son signed ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there's a planet X. out there in the solar system somewhere
