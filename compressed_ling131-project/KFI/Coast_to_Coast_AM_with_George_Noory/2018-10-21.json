{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "... to me well your own thousand dollars so when he starts back up Monday morning between five oh five at five twenty five KFI [noise]\nI Am more stimulating talked to didn't start seeing place friendships in here [noise]\nWhat last time solving a a naval mystery from Nineteen forty two twenty seven march Nineteen forty two and a Thirteen ship\nUS Navy convoy in the north Atlantic um the battleship Washington the aircraft carrier USS Wasp and others are speeding as fast as they can go\nTo Scott a flow of Scotland where they're going to begin European operations for World War two the call was made at ten thirty one in the morning there was a man overboard ships maneuver around the man is seen\nBy lookouts on various ships the last ship spotted the man solve the man's face down in the water and the task force was not turned around to recover his body because it was war time they had to keep going so what they can do is at least must her an account for who it is it's missing\nSo the ships do one count every ship comes up a hundred percent except for one\nThe battleship ... Washington now the the commander of the task force admiral John de Wilcox\nUm uh uh probably one of the most mortal sins rather a mortal sin of a commander is to lose accountability of their men or the other one would be to lose his ship because of incompetence or or a boom tactical ah laziness or or whatever\nSo they're not even in combat you there in a combat zone but they haven't even heard a shot fired and anger and there was a man missing so surely they can accomplish as this easy task well the first count comes up on the U.S has Washington and there are too short so this this took nearly forty five minutes to come up with that count\nSo they're going to recount\nAnd this time the officers are ordered in their workstations to\nAh to physically call out the name of each man and have that man report back in his own voice so this is going to take about another forty five minutes maybe an hour or they need to get this report to the old man to the amoral uh because uh you know they they have to account for the man or come up with the reason why\nSo the count is done this is the captain's job but the U.S is Washington the task force commander he's commander of all Thirteen ships this is not his gig so the captain orders\nAll the officers caught your men's names and your different divisions in engineering or in weapons you know everything so they they go about doing this\nAnd this time they don't come out to men short now they're only one man short\nAnd so they report up to the captain of the U.S is Washington and they say yeah we uh we have a count we're short one man we cannot account for one man you want us to count to get\nThe captain of the Washington the battleship captain Benson says now\nThat'll do it we're not gonna you know we're in a combat zone we can't we can't sit here ah counting noses all day long we've done it twice a week correct in our mistakes were up or down to one man missing okay I'm going to send this report down in the old man\nThe uh the monster is written down and it sent down by a marine century there was a marine on the bridge and there was a marine\nAt the admirals door at the emerald said room or the or notifications given to the marine on the bridge he goes down to the to the task force commanders state room and gives it to the ... century guarding the state run the ... century knocks on the door\nThere is no answer\nHe knocks on the door again there is no answer a second time the Marines century calls for admiral Wilcox there is no answer the marine century enters admiral John de Wilcox estate room and it's empty\nThey search the state room he's not in there\nThen they report back to the captain the only person not accounted for on the U.S is Washington is a task force commander rear admiral John de Wilcox\nUm at that point the ... the uh the men who were on the deck watch our interview by the officer of the day after the day and\nSome of the report seeing admiral Wilcox\nUm a little after ten am that he was walking that one man report said he looked a pale and a bit confused or another says that he seemed a little out of sorts of little out of place but others report that they saw him on the deck just simply walking the deck\nWell now the admirals gone\nAnd so rear admiral John de Wilcox to this day or is\nThe highest ranking US Navy sailors you ever go overboard\nUm nobody to this day knows why there are a series of the obvious theory based on the man who said that he looked a action face and a little confused\nWas that there was a medical issue or at rear admiral Wilcox was in the sixties he was World War one veteran um and uh he seemed eccentric even it but no more so than the average uh admiral or or general\nUm and so the working theory was something medical happened he slipped\nUm another ah most recent theory is that in all likelihood because there's a very very rough seas\nVery well might have been seasick and he might have come up for some fresh air you might have gone to a deck railing again this is a huge battleship us as Washington was an enormous ship and they didn't have men ringing the ship at the railing if you had any common sense you were inside having coffee\nUm I Am in the middle of march to ten thirty in the morning\nWell admiral Wilcox was walking the deck\nAnd if he vomited or he went to the rain like for the reason he very well could have slipped in the ISIS of right off the railing\nHowever those are just theories because nobody will now ever know what happened to rear admiral John de Wilcox his body was never recovered and uh the maximum number of people who saw him last year saw him alive numbered about seven\nThere were six people who saw him in the water and the last you saw him in the water so that he was face down and not moving so it can be reasonably positively assured that he was dead and his body was lost of deceit rear admiral John de Wilcox the\nHighest ranking US Navy sailors ever go overboard anti I should say All right that's what our favorite place will be back tomorrow foresee of right below goes Sunday PM ah thanks actor thanks to join her on a thanks to Josh earlier and

substantiate the same thing so it wasn't a matter of if it was just a matter of one it had to happen\nAnd so again or or did he let it happen did eat while in part I suppose he was sort of and they

know the aircraft carriers mysteriously went out of Pearl Harbor\nSo they were not it Pearl Harbor when the attack happened which is a little sister suspicious you know aircraft carriers tend to be a pretty\n... pretty unnecessary commodity in a word like that and every word actually so you know they had to spare them so they left the harbor if I'm wrong sorry\nBut I mean I I Can't imagine a situation where you would be taking aircraft carriers and ordering them away from a place that you're supposed to be protecting\nSo it was a pretty good evidence to support that uh you know the same

Mussolini at first it was an author of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but you know that again I'm history books being what they are that tends to get the last\nUm [noise] so America gets\nInto the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Burma and she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham a very interesting stuff so um I was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nUm anyway ah we get into the war and we're really have anything to do is down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close England came to losing the right one they were lined up\nOn the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this was what their MO was they used to go in late on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just tape around your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially to France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain and of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill\nSo we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits now all of a sudden\nWe get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them I'm of course to have met previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church who is\nThe one who got the two together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans because they were so similar at the time\nThat Stalin in America and the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be friends\nSo you know to answer your question around about fashion um church elected for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely he was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great birds I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on he wouldn't have been his friend but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful\nSure what I mean isn't that there's still a communist newspapers as far as I'm concerned

completely unstoppable so of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the\nTime he was on like thirty some odd different drugs so he was such\nA delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch horses in midstream and go toward style and read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and he'll just says well I don't care\nI Want to do it so Stalin is already

[laughter] and here's some people who have actually tried to poison other people throughout history\nOr you know it sounds outlandish that our president can be a poison this way but it's it's actually quite a kind of thing the emperor Claudio us Napoleon Mark Anthony field Petra Queen Elizabeth King Henry the eighth Abraham Lincoln these people all were so worried about poison ivy head foods officers\nSo they were a little bit more sophisticated about this\nWe actually have um\nIn America we have the presidential food safety theme and there's\nA set up a security zone where the first

war two is concerned how\nThey tried to get rid of each other there were forty two attempts on Hitler's life from Nineteen thirty three to Nineteen forty four and even Irwin rom all they knew Hitler

that's\nWhere allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the stock market was not as big as it is today and there are only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly\nAnd Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else to do that and they started the SEC the security Exchange Commission and FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote it takes a correct to crush across\n[laughter] really interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I Love to hear it but there were there when he came from Denver\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family are probably it's old money so you know just kind of keep the Toomey elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all my\nI'd also hurt and I don't know this is true but that that's FDR's mother to Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those they used to call them the Boston bringing those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be on that as well\nYeah I had heard that\nAbout the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging these guys are never written a book let me tell you what\nIf I was paid a penny an hour I'd be lucky [laughter]\nTime you research and dig and dig and dig because if you ask your name so he wants to be as best they can you know for them as far as like the I I still get fascinated by stuff

lifelong learning he's spoken publicly numerous times both in personnel on the radio and then September twenty twelve you spoke to the prestigious lecture series mind and super mind which is run by yes BCC\nGraham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the month for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty fourteen years the author of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAnd his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to coast to coast am how are you I'm\nRichard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease\nUm how should we just practice I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he\nWas an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen happened to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her\nThrough some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so we have an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake\nPsychics or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little\nBit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might spend some money to get that um that young student\nWho had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean what happened him come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma into his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh hell he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he would even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nMagician would be in the middle of his you know if a on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer would take a picture and\nAnd ah you know the fake medium would be totally surprise you and you say I'm Harry Houdini me pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah\nThis rumbling on beating on Harry right under\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything right anyway\nI thought it was ... I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circle sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yeah it's a ... was a prominent spiritual so how did that how did that friendship survive\nAs the fact that Harry was such an avowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes this was movement is not exactly a ... in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nA matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise]\n... signing\nPresident Trump says he will uphold the U.S out of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia Trump says Moscow has violated the agreement Russia has said the United states is in violation of Nineteen eighty seven packed helps protect the security of the U.S and its European and far east allies ...\nShopping center a new problem in Baldwin park that's all they can watch just before plenty hill the mold the car crashes only stop so you're pretty backed up from the ... avenue\nThat's because of a heart fire them for about seven to right wing taken away and he ... he'll side south out whether you're tell ... has\nBeen ... blow for some bread were so some delays starting from Beverly east LA seven ten south out what are your motorcycles has only stuff there so you're pretty damn from surgery\nPalmer's on the seven ten now from Washington just give us Paul Ralph anytime traffic lines ... five hundred and five thousand and three to let us none of the ... are pretty low stand on that looks like they're going to wrap that up around nine pretty backed up from Whittier can't find the guy gets you there faster I'm ...

said something like that to Mrs Houdini want to be a NATO or something like that it's not on the online version but um but anyway I think she just got tired of arguing with anybody and wanted to be with the people that she's been with her whole life and be accepted by them there's also a lot of confusion and we should touch on this because I think we should go into everything\nArthur Ford himself shortly after I think it was about\nA couple of years after the say on\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his sister ... ties with his car accident and his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with bike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James hike up yes it was up here on on I'm In Canada upon are now a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah yeah yeah and\nI think it's an I'm looking at a Nineteen sixty seven Ford how let's say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide the year before\nNow what Ford did for this high profile say on what he did with all the secret do little things that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on us Thomas a I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak\nMaybe OK I'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better it is okay\nI'm James ... this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV yes\nAnd and he does a little upfront research brings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people\nSo this is another black mark against Arthur board and it's again muddy the water for this case Houdini case as fun as it is and as exciting as it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on a Houdini case\nYeah that's that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just that it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best as a re catching and\nYou know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these say officers high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nShe did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and it was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight\nOnly once a year for one night to do the Santa and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down in the building but then they said let's get back on the top one will be higher closer to God and the spirits anyway\nI think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail so she can say that statement at the end you know and yours is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut your inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that you wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex you're being a spirit guide in Fort at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nTell the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and they will prove it a thousand time and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to prove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick the prove my point for the simple reason that I could not believe communication was possible\nI Am now and here in my desire to undo this mistake how all those lost faith because of my mistake to lay a whole again of hope and to live with the knowledge that vice is continuing\nThat is my message to the world through my wife and through this psychic media are those are the were\nFantastic Thomas how do people get a hold of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAmazon dot com is both a paperback and e book

you know people are\nThey're flying off the the bookshelves people are buying them but do you get also some pushback because you're you're this is kind of uncomfortable for some people you're you're pulling their their reality out from under them\nYeah I'm really I'm playing with people's normalcy bias and they don't like it [laughter] you know people like it um you know\nPeople always tend to believe the first story we're told you know\nI'm only some of the stories that were first told them I was born in one of your work to record this but\nUm you know a lot of history as ... or you know and people don't like it when you re investigates things in a in the capital the lookout for among them\nAll in the case of the things that I write I as I've saturated by history and I just moved back

fall into that because\nOut of every four or five books that I start to look into that one might make it will be information that I find so it's not like I say well that's right that's a much smaller [laughter] it's\nNot worth it leaving it all makes it makes you have to go so\nFar right now in the case of FDR um you know this is [laughter] Seventy almost Seventy five years ago three quarters of a

he's a posted that there are many countries for example including Russia and Canada are are not nearly as big as we think\nAnd the problem is it's very difficult to portray the reality of a skeptical world and a flat map and so you get this distortion\nIt's called the Mercator projection map of the most commonly seen hanging in classrooms in textbooks it was created back in Fifteen Ninety six I think it's maybe time we have and what was it was designed to help sailors navigate the world the ... the Mercator projection buddy distorts seriously distorts the size of land masses\nSo for example you may have noticed that a while Africa is around fourteen times larger than Greenland and yet on the map\nBoth are almost the same size Greenland is huge on these maps Brazil another example Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska yet Alaska is much larger than Brazil on the map much larger\nThe map also suggested Scandinavian countries are larger than India whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together\nLooks like Europe is larger than North America on on these old maps but in reality the reverse is true\nRussia is the largest it's

Mussolini at first he was an all Mussolini so Mussolini actually started\nThe whole thing but you know again I'm history books being what they are that tendency over the last um [noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more\nThan a month every night um people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\nOn coverage of entry and in Birmingham a very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way um anyway\nAh we get into the war and we're really have anything to do is down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea\nAccording to my end it was there how close\nEngland cans are losing their island they were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this is what their MO was they used to go in the late on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just tape around your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially with France\nAnd they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get their rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them\nI'm of course that who had met previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest\nWith the church shows the one who got the two together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans because they were so similar at the time\nThat Stalin in America and the the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we went in with your friends\nSo you know the answer your question around about fashion um church elected for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great birds I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on he wouldn't have been his fan but of course we weren't getting that\nUntil decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times where they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure communism he wasn't\nThere's still a communist newspapers as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ... billion\nFDR it seemed a bit from reading your book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns as Donald was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we needed style and Stalin didn't need us\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and it's and Stalin had to pack well Hitler violated the pack and went after style in which completely blues silence mind\nAnd they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then you know it was ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now it was leaving under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course in midstream and go towards styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and they were just says well I don't care I Wanna do it so\nStyle is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever and here he has the opportunity to play a little a little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's dollars table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later to Iran I think in a was Turan in Nineteen forty three and again for forty three correct\nThey have at even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world ah and still at this point you know I I the patriots Roosevelt still looks pretty robust or you know he\nYou know by by the standards in Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I Want to back up with a minute and talk about the assassination squads hitting that we're
