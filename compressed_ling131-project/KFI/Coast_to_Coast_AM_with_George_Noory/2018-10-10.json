here\nAre not on the individual size when you're talking about it and understand the ... was oh\nAbsolutely and so what we have done is taking so what would happen so what we have done is as soon as

least impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nMugele has announced then it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus accounts let's\nCheck in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lauren\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so\nNow what is Google Plus from silver ...\nIs Google's a social networking platform as it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter in the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um there's going to be missed\nWas if he had to be missed by millions of people ... this is the story that's been going on for ages all with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy ... book [noise]\nSo there was no separate income stream coming from it\nIn the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's been going on\nBut sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\n... of the right at the top uh they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly announced that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't is they found that in a during ... as I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it was a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that were that were um theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers of financial information nothing like that a lot of stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation\nAnd they kind of fat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting a demotion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about ten months but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place you know um and uh it would have been a lot better all around if they had\nIn the meantime all of us who have been using Google Plus all these years or try to find other places to go where experimenting with other things and I mentioned that there the Google commercial version of Google Plus\nWhich operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you have a five bucks a month or per head using it that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially\nUh and and we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably not a good idea in the first place\nThat's a time at ... at the end at the time well it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that an enormous growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question I hear Snapchat is going broke who do you hear\nA apparently Snapchat having all kinds of all kinds of problems um I guess their stock has been a walloped yeah that's a very well uh their their founder has been sending out there or you know kind of\nMessages to the troops to kind of ... credit cheer them up uh it it it appears that some pretty serious mistakes were made along the way when they when they tried to grow\nA that's you know that can happen when you're trying to grow rapidly you know ... you can live off the ball and you and you can really uh fall flat later on whether or not that ... that that will be able to pull out of this I I don't know but right now that they're not they're certainly not the uh uh the star of of the moment like they were some time ago\nPoint thanks Lorna appreciated up next an end to

right now is we talk about his work in in the upside down thinking\nWhat the pre sentiment creek cognition studies have done it to reverse order\nWhere the body is measured before the picture is shown and no one knows what picture will be shown because it's randomly generated by a computer\nSo the computer will vary the picture shown sometimes it and violent picture sometimes at the picture of a peaceful landscape like a mountain or river want something that wouldn't arouse the body\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect think Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is ...\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would ... audience members to and then they chew videotapes of various anchor people and the the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in present meant experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no psycho Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you uncover their\nRights again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true\nAnd I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is this ability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and one in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent one overtime\nWhat the experiment does is asked people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more once as heroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd in people do people have that ability or have\nThat's right George ... those me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which wasn't offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nAre set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines where they're\nGenerating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world around event that we know are produced heightened emotions and nine eleven as one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a concentrate basically at a at a single moment that\nWe can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events what do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers\nBefore the event yeah before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nFor a yellow her you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for ... she had the ability to use a bench booms and keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who say dollars trickery its magic\nBut do you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught can cycle can ... be taught\nWell I've heard of of spoon bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nBending metal for example and early ... as an example\nWhere many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw\nKeller than there are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gallery very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I clued in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons ending\nIn the context of remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say in the direct quote from a classified document where\nHe was he was put under very I mean they were watching it closely what the documents that is as a result of Keller except in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated paranormal perceptual ability and convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo yeah there has been a lot about him but the documents suggest that studies were run and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the ability that maybe he was

about whether the brain hallucinates shows that light that everybody seems to see going into that tunnel or whether something is really\nGoing on here it is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up short this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was the nation perhaps it gives us into a window into a reality that we typically don't eat with our eyes\nThat I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are the cardiac arrest studies known at\n... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have their in cardiac arrest ever sat potatoes and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to see after they've had the experience rather than asking people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nSo these are cardiologist for example Dr ... and ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in\nCardiac arrest severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning so if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences\nThat are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is\nFrom doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen\nOne of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room\nIt was later found to be the difficulty later and we know that that's happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the time were being stamp and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinct gets down and yet this person came back in described to sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body\nThe seeds and nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body\nIntel's the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make that according to this material is perspective that we need you know brain in order to have conscious experience memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this point and apple the University of Virginia the division of perceptual study that the med school had looked at the very closely and Dr Bruce scraping his one person in particular\nWe looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off\nAnd they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not it was the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities in markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see but they're out there\nThat's such an important point I think we tend to be biased by\nWhat are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes ... a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us that are this thing but we just don't perceive them All right let's\nSome calls here for you as they begin to line up enough to get a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot of damage you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut Connecticut bill by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist and a materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah there is this phenomena going I just think regarding and these\nAh where where the mind I Would use the word mine not sold but mine are conscious just goes uh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious and she was like there is no God or no devil\nI Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be\nSeeing you ... you know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically ah I like it\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about psych medications all explained psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded Xanax her aunt antidepressants or major tranquilizers or electronics\nTheft chemically the brain and their work they do affect chemical you the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain is true that headaches\nThe going back to ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and fix the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain it does affect the conscious of the minds it does seem to show it here's my question for your doesn't that show that if\nThe mine in the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the mine is connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that\nCorrelation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another we can't automatically concluded that one causes the other so here's a simplistic example\nFrom Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise]\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up a very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with a grain of highly related to consciousness you damage the brain you you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhat ... what do you think mark of reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence\nFor it we we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out\nThere's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it ... it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall things that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified my medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nYes and in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drowning let's say\nArea where the incident occurred was a non ... area\n... Scott Johnson says some passengers were able to take other trains to get around the stoppage but there was no bus service between Union Station in the area near Cal State\nThe challenge with that is we don't have enough trains on the other side of the incident to provide enough connections\nHe says five to seven thousand people use the San Bernardino line every afternoon hurricane Michael's now a category ... storm it's closing in on the Florida Panhandle hurricane\nMichael is going to be a devastating storm that to a part of Florida is not seen a storm of this magnitude in quite some time\nFEMA associate administrator Jeff ... says a huge storm surge is expected perhaps a size twelve feet\nMichael's expected to make landfall tomorrow at least a hundred and twenty thousand people in the panhandle in order to get out forecasters say the hurricane could also dumps several inches of rain in Georgia and Virginia and the Carolinas the British Parliament has invited a robot to become the first non human to appear as a witness before the legislative body the robot named pepper\nLives in middle six university and we'll get a hearing next week it will give be at a hearing next week an artificial intelligence robotics and the fourth industrial revolution\nPeppers equipped with two H.

sound like you're open to the possibility that there's something very unusual going on\nYes I'm In my work it might work out too often not often but several times over my career I had the opportunity to accompany a rural folks farm folks on doubting with water which in yes okay I've seen it work the at work and then seeing the drillers calm\nAnd drill right to that same to adapt and there it is

tortoise in the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior to when the rain\nComes out within within you know maybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure and they know that feeling yeah they can feel it it's their reading something but to the to the to to to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time just clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin say the things Steven just said we're on our way isn't it\nYeah even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's\nA academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\n[noise] mhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field the physics\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements and the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest than anything the travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between distant particles\nSo there are things in the fat fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do tactically this is opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion of interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which if we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that it has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank

with the ... the age of Fifteen she was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which of Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and we used to not only understand but also control the gift of the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult shelters\nShe's practice studied instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and it was a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nOh thank you so much for having me we could afford to the point of Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yes uh I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right [laughter] tell me about\nLori Cabot the official which I'm sure they will\n[noise] you know he's very a a wonderful\nWoman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was barely renowned and the city and she still is\nUm she's known as you know the high priest is in Salem and feel often when I was younger see her walking around town you know dressed in her her job and very regal looking very um you know she's ... big presents\nNo person and ... at\nThe time to people welcome or with open arms you did they go oh my God there's er which\nYeah that's a great question see you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but let's just say the town in Salem not necessarily [laughter] so it always seemed to be at those days\nIt was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right for the type of season and it's you know go to Sam I'm so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about we back to your family you said the stability what year are who do the start with\nNo my um\n[noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you want to scare me she just you know my father though he thought just those girls insane [laughter] um but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by\nUm and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to you know she'd tell my father she is normal um\nBut she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still you know involved let's say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was with talking you know in their sixties she finally told me that he is you don't want Maureen\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and\nReading to them and she said you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio so would\nYou see that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight\nSo I never really knew her\nUm but my great grand right grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted\nIn her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed dome stories from one to the other the the you could carry through\nYou know the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and uh she was maybe maybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you had a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy\nUm and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true so she was very unique that's what she said so then the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm above the earth's anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England it goes project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me to tell the story but he started this story after I'm\nA near death experience um and he had to you know work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took to try to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing on goes that his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus on but it's a team of individuals that\nYou know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for the things that go on for the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nSee one look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain\nAnd people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help um\nHow many people are just a off the wall when you go to their house and then you're just losing it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred and investigations um\nI Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we are big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it\nUm so if you say how many people I say good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street you get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their life\nWhat have you concluded about what this may be I mean a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think they are\nWell I think there are varying degrees\nOf what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know and love one another okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they passed\nOn but then you know you're called out to some locations where you know things aren't really going while someone's gotten\nDown the stairs items and being tossed around the house um there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a balanced or from the stairs on you know all these\nOne is looking at me and we get in the house and he said I think I have a little girl in spirit and you look around and Marron shattered glass table can buy it and it just looked like kind of went to the house with that\nUm it was just on a pond and they were terrified and he said you know my phone's been ringing with arrows on it and my wallet went missing and\nHe's telling me all the things they can paint I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick out\nSo after a few minutes and thinking oh my God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know scared of a man very angry I'm trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this is a man now it's not and he was getting adamant that you know it wasn't and I can talk to\nYou and ran out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right I'm really run up at the top of the driveway with the guy knew any rags me down on the driveway and he said I Want you to come back here tonight by yourself and I said\nWell you know I really don't feel it's a little girl you gotta be careful you know you don't want to welcome as something that you don't know it's there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nMy best friend she said and I'm telling you right now that with him and it's got to be a little girl and I want to hear and I thought oh God I just have to get out of here so that\nThat is scary hey we'll be back in the moment with more on coast to coast than\nWhen they break [noise]\nI'm Michael crows your live from the KFI

or I or whatever\nBut you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by audio than you would bring

about halfway down the law the side of the wall you know it's going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself and she came and then they didn't want her to miss anything so I stopped and waited for ... I saw her I continually walk all await towards the door and I waited\nAnd waited and yet\nNobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just now this there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my spiel to wait for her to walk in\nAnd yet there was no one here and oddly enough that said location is where the coast guard 'cause it's on the coast guard base a coast guard reported seeing women walking on the wall in that same location so it's that was kind of intriguing\nAn I'm perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public a ghost town on a road island light hosts and benefit\nPool meals main we're in the White House ah keep his house it was on the\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on the picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen I serve dog all across the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the yeah yeah the the there was no\nSounded outside jumped up and meal you know ran for the kitchen and the dog to the door was closed so I came back and spoke to the woman and she says right when you see it I just actually\nOr dog she says described sure absolutely absurd squares that described it should just\nShook smiled at me and she says well you know run there was a White House keeper here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved them leave the island\nOr the dog will go with the White House keepers afterward took care of them to a dog actually died and I don't she says the dog you describe pretty much mattresses because she has a dog a dog and like the ship picture it looked like it but can I say that was what do I know\nBut so I mean it's two things that I'm really not looking for goes\nBut certainly saw it would appear to me at the upper Russia\nWhen it's still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back and both of you are old will take phone calls next on coast to coast am runs website of course is linked up at ... dot com and their latest book is called more ghost chronicles\nShall I put out comes on I think you said I never get out their sales email for credit card to get used to do identity to stay safe secure and download my you know a lot store today and get one you're free\nMethod you ... if you are considering going back to school I guess also following questions do you need the flexibility to take classes on your schedule he left college credit teeny transferred to earn a quality degree from a world renowned university if you answered yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school for you\nArizona State university authors over a hundred and fifty highly ranked degree programs a hundred percent on line to learn the same degree as you would on campus from wherever you are on your schedule\nPlus assay one line except most transfer credits for information tax base to three five ... learned for yourself by the wall Street Journal ranks asked you stay in the nation from producing the best qualified graduates and white eighty seven percent of ask you grab recruited within Ninety Days have graduation\nLearn to grow learn to succeed and learn to thrive at Arizona State university to learn more about ASU one line degrees tax base to three five five one seven that's S.

ah influence\nI I have to note somewhat about it for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to do a where the costs of trade your your investigative for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of tickle area you might want to concentrate your audio recording Syria\nIf for a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you kinda you have to have a little bit of it I tried to get too much into the details with whoever the the quietness for lack of it or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for strictly investigate\nThat the popular question 'cause that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know\nYou know what were they doing you know they're not going to release his parents and you know those are things you hear from people but you know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know that they want help to move on and that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want that go started there\nI always ask them and you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect from us and I very at the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house cleanse is something we're not going to do it without you know or are we from someone else\nBut they wanted to investigate to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls free both to view let's go to brandy and granted bay California Welcome to the program I brandy\nHer hey thank you for taking my call

old I've been told stories all my wife\nAnd most of the goes things have been around tragedies that happen to people who are trapped in clean\nI go uh towards the matrix\nThat oh I think the people who are experiencing with ... and I don't take that away from him when I Believe that ... ... euros into wars and the Jews to nine or some time interfere with and we see will we see me feel good we filmed themes ... they moved but this is my question\nMy questions and all the tragedy that don't happen on this planet and and that's not excluding things have happened right here in this country if\nThe protocol the goals would be because you have had tragedies or on in your life that took away your life then there would be more goes on this planet any will be people\nAnd just let's just deal with the United states itself I mean uh I Am part Cherokee and so I'm just saying the tragedy happened in them in all the people Jews all over the world what is the protocol to be a goal and if you believe in their\n... if it's not the matrix\nOr could you ever considered this being the matrix and the numbers you just not calculating that these are the way it should be\nThat is my question thank you for your joined or music or their George I love all your music all the way from bluegrass dude sold to everything from the years you've been play you a number one when it comes to that\nAll right my friend more to come so what what what is the definition Ron oh what a ghost becomes why does it become a ghost\nYou're not the sixty four thousand dollar question Georgian\nEnvy honestly we really don't know exactly what a ghost is I mean ah when I first started doing this I used to work with a Franciscan monks and we had a cause a religious aspects of it\nAnd we come up with the feeling that maybe some of this is the perfect terrific not like it's a punishment but rather\nIts place it's a temporal thing versus the and the thing so I mean that's they're just going on during their time basically but that's I mean that's the only one theory there are many three shifts the tragedy thing is when I always heard about\nIn Gettysburg was always supposed to be the most part it then that's why it's the most thing but there are there are battles I mean Nagasaki ... I mean thousands of people will tell like that why are we seeing like\nAlmost goes further out so there's got to be certain aspects of that we were unaware of or or have yet to determine and a ... and really be quite honestly nobody knows exactly\nFor sure we have our theories and that's all it is\nAre there any friendly ghosts like Casper or are they all tied the evil [laughter]\nWell well yeah I mean what's what's the guardian angel what's a you know spirit guide I I'm a you know the ghost to maybe\nI guess it depends on what a definition of the ghost might be I mean if someone\nIt sees their

is and have you\nHave you felt that you had something following you\nOh my entire life you have come from very early childhood vote there's something following me I had an experience when I was about seven years old\nMy backyard my parents were both inside the house and I came in screaming because some some things that my name into my ear and it made my ear vibrate why that bringing out now have you ever felt voice\nHave you felt threatened or do you feel secure with whatever entity is doing this\nYou know it's kind of a mix of airing you here and then there are times when I feel like it I don't ever feel like it's trying to hurt me but I Do feel like there's certain people in my life but it goes into effect in wave\nAnd interesting what let me tell you in the in the short time we have left my experience is\nThat if these entities aren't hurting you uh the the I don't think you have much to worry about Maureen we've only got about thirty seconds left would you agree with that if he's not being heard that the these entities aren't out to really hurt him\nAbsolutely and I was gonna say George you get a great job because that was the same thing I Would ask because typically I don't think it's a who I mean am what something is following I think that if someone\nUm and I think it's more of a relative it's like a guide and all that is looking over you know maybe there will be watching out for you and sometimes not as ... when they speak with you but I don't think they're there to harm you\nAll right both of you thank you so much for being on the program the name of the

social networking platform it if if the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um is going to be missed\nWhat it's going to be missed by millions of people you know this is the story of going on for ages all with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put in the ads on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy bonds or post right these are both things that drives people crazy or his book\nSo there was no separate income stream coming from it\nIn the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have the ads you gotta have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's been going on\nBut sizes everything with social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\nBlew up the right at the top uh they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't is they found that in a during ... as I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it's ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers of financial information nothing like that law that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation\nAnd they kind of fat on it and write and now of course it kind of makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first

the phenomenon of the brain that comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true\nAnd I think the most compelling studies that have been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators these machines\nSpit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent zeros and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more once as heroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen what they felt something was going on because these random generators more just went ballistic\nAnd in people people have that ability or have\nThat's right George those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is looked at the behavior of the machines around the world\nAround events that we know are produced heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant trick basically at a at a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike\nHappened before the plane hit the towers before the event yeah before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nFor a yellow her you know that name of course an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for ... she had the

well this hour mark the near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the\nBrain hallucinates shows that light that everybody seems to see going into that tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up short this is a really really important one because if if there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was an Asian perhaps they give them into a window into\nA reality that we typically don't be with her eyes that I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling evidence are the cardiac arrest studies known at ... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people had\nTheir in cardiac arrest ... hated and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to say after they've had the experience rather than at any people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nOn back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the rain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is\nFrom doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen\nOne of the patients in particular had a very vivid out of body experience ... where he heard something in the room it was later found to be the difficulty later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the time were being stamp and we know when that hit ... later went off and it made it very distinct it down\nAnd yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when the brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever\nThen they come the person comes back into his body Intel's the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make that according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have a conscious experience memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this point and apple the University of Virginia the division of perceptual study that the med school had looked at the very closely and Dr Bruce scraping his one person in particular\nWe look at these phenomenon and it's finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities in markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see but they're out there\nThat's such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us that are existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I still get a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you doing an incredible drama on this topic you've learned a lot haven't you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nWhat's going to build from West Hartford Connecticut Kenneth Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist than a materialist however I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and the ease\nUh where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious has goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there's no God or no devil I Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be\nSeeing you ... you know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically ah I like it\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about psych medications all explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers neural ethics\nTheft chemically the brain and their work they do affect chemical you the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that for headaches [laughter]\nThe going back to psych ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain or does it affect the conscious as the mines does seem to show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that\nIf the mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there's a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another we can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example\nFrom Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness you damage the brain if you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen what do you think mark of reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's the chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nYes and in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified

his amazing assistance in putting this altogether\nSong well grounded in the materialistic as parents of the world\nYet there's something going on here that we can't quite put our fingers on is it that the more the field that Rupert shell break shelves right mhm wrote about or is there some very very subtle\nElectro mechanical field that surrounds us all I mean we are electric chemical beings but at the physical level we have iron molecules moving through an electric\nFeel our nervous system that's magnetism okay Beth electricity stiffed the same thing when you were in fifth grade and you

earth which you know is is thinner than the skin of an orange on an orange\nOr is some old you know the whole guy is a whole you know very complex very very huge being that exists it's on its own timescale show our lifetime of Seventy eight years but but what a breath of year\nWhich you know again if everything derived from consciousness that's the same thing that Michael ... talks about right with consciousness\nWas sound like you're open to the possibility that there's something very unusual going on\nYes I'm In my work and my work I've often not often but several times over my career I had the opportunity to accompany a rural folks farm folks on ... with water which in yes okay I've seen it work the at work and then seeing the drillers calm\nAnd drill right to that same to adapt\nAnd there it is ... and ... you know again I'm a scientist okay so it's not that that there is this something there that we don't fully understand\nThen can we say that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's suppose that um the Dow is her\nAnd I've seen it with three different methods brass rods willow sticks and tendons over a map mhm okay I'll watch pendulum over a map which was the most strangest one of all that somebody could could could find water and yet there it is up comes to water [laughter] so\nAre is the Dow is there a particularly sensitive to the electromagnetic rocks in the earth caused by the water moving through various layers of conducting semi conducting insulating properties\nWho knows what I had to fight this we need to we in science\nCommodity lord ... cannot ignore going all the way back your your your guest mentioned William James\nOkay all that whole period we went all of this a lot of his early early research started\nInto shall we say five to ... and other other sorts of things and I I I I've never seen a U.S I never see what I could call a UFO the night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw it when I never did before but I saw two\nYeah so I can put up all this stuff that has to do for instance a desert tortoises will show up at the mud hole the desert tortoise in the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior to\nWhen the rain\nComes out within with things you know maybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure and they know that feeling yeah they can feel it it's it's they're reading something but to the to the to the to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time just clicking by here no there's no question that if science can see the things Steven just said we're on our way isn't it\nYeah even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's\nA academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field a physics that has been around for over a hundred years\nIs accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counterintuitive there's a phenomenon known as entanglements and the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now I Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest that anything could travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between distant articles\nThat there are things in the fat and the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do psychic ... this is opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which if we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that this this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend

of year where we talk about those stories that we're going to talk about them now the name of the book by wrong collecting Maureen would more goals chronicles stories from the wrong with the young known the unexplained the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic trench medium for as far back as she can remember\nChoose communicated with the ... the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with Maureen Cabot\nWas the official which of Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and we used to not only understand but also control the gift of the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult ...\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more has been with the New England goes project since two thousand one and it was a company to group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nOh thank you so much for having me we could afford to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yes uh I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right [laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which I'm sure they will\nKnow he's very a a wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was barely renowned and the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest is in Salem and he'll often when I was younger see her walking around town you know dressed in her\nHer job and very regal looking very um you know she's ... big presents\nFor a person and ... at\nThe time did people welcome or with open arms you did they go oh my God there's er which\nYeah that's a great question see you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but\nLet's just say the town and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seem to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and\nUm so basically she did you know she really changed the whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism writes Adele type of these and then it's you know go to Sam I'm so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a fifth generation psyche trance medium that means we're talking about we back to your family you said the stability what year are who did it start with\nNo my um [noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my father though he thought just those girls insane\n[laughter] um but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to you know she told my father she is normal um\nBut she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still you know involved let's say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in their sixties she finally told me that he is you don't want Maureen\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and\nReading for them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio so\nWould you see that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so I\nNever really knew her um but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted\nIn her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed dome stories from one to the other the the you could carry through\nYou know the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and she was maybe maybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy\nUm and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true so she was very unique that what you said so then the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about the earth's anyway you\nKnow you've been with the New England new goes project Maureen since two thousand one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me to tell the story but he started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special courts a class that he took\nTo try to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing it on goes set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus on but it's a team of individual that\nYou know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody\nIs really you know it's a great scene with people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for things that go on for the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nSee one look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run and the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain\nAnd people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just a off the wall when you go to their house and then you're just losing it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] terrified as birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred investigations\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in a while isn't good reason why you don't see it um so if\nYou say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street you'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their life\nWhat have you concluded about what this may be I mean a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think they are\nWell I think there are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience and my experience over the years has been you know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I\nMore of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and let their loved one though they're okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house um there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them\nUm we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs or you know all these\nWe we get there and if that meant to guys there one day this was really rough and tumble you know and this one guy you know like one I think his name was ... and the big big guy haven't had to get credit you know just\nOverwhelming right here in San Juan is looking at me and we could in the house and he said I think I have a little girl in spirit and you look around and then there is a shattered glass table by it and it just looked like him and went through the house with that\nUm it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know my phone's been ringing without arrows on it and my wallet went missing and now he's telling me all the things they can and I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick out\nSo after a few minutes and thinking oh my God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know scared of him and very angry and very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this is a man now it's not and he was getting adamant that you know it wasn't and I talked to\nUse and brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right I'm Ilene run up at the top of the driveway with the guy knew any dragged me down on the driveway and he said I Want you to come back here tonight by yourself and I said\nWell you know I really don't feel it's a little girl and you got to be careful you know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know is there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nMy best friend she said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want to hear and I thought oh God I just have to get out of here so that\nThat is scary hey we'll be back in the moment with more on coast to coast than\nWhen they break
