dong Mike ear on KFI\nOr to pay no sure\nI own a delivery service your ranch or could come on you're we deliver medical marijuana\nLaw ... man after my hard\nWell to me you know I see the flip side of marijuana does to people just flip to soak you sure about eighty percent of our customers are single young man living in smelly apartments\n[laughter] what you do start their way to say that again what what percentage\nEighty percent of the guys of the people that we're doing what we're used to live\nIn rancho cook among your rights\nAre single men living in ... apartment\nSingle white men no no all races all races okay\nThe only time we do nice houses is when the ... somebody have my mom cheer kind of come outside to meet you I'm not the only time we really get Mike nice houses but most of the time it's apartments\nAll do you want so what you're saying is perhaps smoking too much weed and being lazy to the point where you are you having a delivered a might reduce your motivation in life\nWell let me tell you what the cheaper gets the more so who's going to Rob ... coming from a guy who smokes twenty joined today\nWow I 'cause anybody know when you say you know you have you gone to a long you been smoking\nThat much we twenty nine twenty nine when I first started in the next day it changed my life\nI quit my job within a year holy smokes and your ... joined today minimum and have you gone through a depression phase\n... everything anybody who says marijuana does not have withdrawals yeah I've never smoked enough marijuana\nI also heard that uh if you smoke on a regular basis you will go through a radical depression at one point\nOh what you wouldn't believe headaches oh boy in the whole thing it is for me it's become a drug in my life and I walk I got a God that I have to smoke in the morning\nI listen I I understand it you know a reality socks and if if you can do something you\nKnow every day to distance yourself from reality I should understand doing that\nYou owe ... or moving totally of denial I'm actually kind of having fun but\nYeah so that when we used to do it with everything\nBut you know the the flip side to it no voters have voted to have their marijuana\nI mean you see people die in the trash can save a nickel who's going to go pay fifty five dollars a day plus how sort of a black market is just for a sure\nBet oh the effects would go into court shows are so happy 'cause now they could parts or their products in California\nRight now it's legal to have it but you're right on the black market is you know look if I don't smoke on a regular basis I might I might hit it once or twice a year if that wide I if I were to be a regular smoker I Would never go to one of those pot shops\nYou know they have cops outside writing down your your licenses and you know they're just it's like a liquor store that you know they always have their eye out on\nIt and and by the way with the stroke of a pen and I don't even think he has to sign

there are so busy case by case they're chased far with this ridiculous\nOh my congratulations man one more call here Jim you're on camp on\nTo me\nHey anytime somebody has said they have a good embarrassing story I'd like to hear that\nOkay uh with the church about a week or two ago and I was a we're just kind of sitting there and I was in the early server and kinda nodding off a little bit in the past we're talking about uh getting into the Bible and eat it out\nAnd I went\nOff [laughter] holy crap [laughter] teen people looking at me going what was that that is great man that is that [laughter] so\nThat the the the worst part is that\nWhen I go back a church now um I spit on the opposite side right because everything's I'm afraid\nBut I ... I can top your embarrassing church story I was at a at a at a church in Dearborn onto Dearborn, Michigan and it was as\nBig as St Patrick's cathedral it's a huge huge old beautiful church and we're there on a Wednesday with my mom and then whenever we drove through town my mom would make us go to church no matter what day it was and light a candle and say your prayers all six kids were kneeling in the front of the church\nAnd you could hear a pin drop there's nobody in their seats for thousands of people and you couldn't hear a beep so we all kneel down\nAnd I started really loud and I looked to my sister and I go Kelly and my mom's smacked during the back of the head\nI mean there's so much wrong with that you know doing it in church blaming your sister having your mom's macaroni\nI'm at his news from the frontiers of science a couple of quick hits on what's coming up later on for open lines and Michael Steele and coming up next on coast to coast am in for George

we will not disappoint both tomorrow night and tonight or coming up uh again tomorrow night the uh the book that I think you will love hear the story of the men from the train\nAs scary as that story is um it's still not as scary in some respects that some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael dealing with Glenn joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd\nIf you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunted place in America\nAnd uh and when cameras captured ghosts all of those stories are in the news segment and coast to coast am dot com but there's also this other story on the top of the fold right in the carousel\nOn the top of the website it goes to ... am dot com and that this string of play a little bit of it here give you a heads up on it because I Love to get back to this coming up later on in the show wrote in\nDowntown Oregon City there are there it's just like at least that's the theory behind paranormal activity\nWitness that science hero treat a candidate dispensary\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy ... next to it I said oh capitals over\nPositive here and we'll just get back to that later on but you can go see the whole story at ... am to come\nAnd look at the video and then try to explain that coming up later on okay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencils I I don't know\nYour ... believe me there there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell ah you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked ... uh uh\nUh later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are\nAmongst I think in the elite group of science reporters\nPeople who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way um I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing terrific tell me and I know she's a she's a frequent guest year and they're very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she left to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and wish she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list them urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you'll pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... but I mean I what what\nIs the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I bet fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America on including Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook\nBasically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that as far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the story\nThe Walt Disney had his head a frozen and uh with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth what and saw it more likely that um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nOh and I was reading some of those sanctions in I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not that big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their actions and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut do we how realistic is it ever in the near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really\nAbout what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world\nI tell for example the story of Iran mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got his finger in this whole neural net\nChapter and I thought you know I Can't just\nServe this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so\nHere you're my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise]\nUm I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are really in a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this\nBut then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise] what I think we need now because we are at the threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim or great\nAnd so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA\nWith the dream of becoming a scientist since second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where it caught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started at myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be an export into wisdom and Buddhism and Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism\nAnd finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life\nAnd she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith I'm a\nChristian and I take my my face very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist phase system there are some innovations in this book\nThat I think um we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should\nWe then that's where we go with the next pitch the classic study so much so that the pope rodents fetus at ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael Guillen list next on coast to coast am\n[noise] [noise] and when they break [noise]\nI'm ready for their life and they can find plenty

DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and\nThere is an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering what we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're drawing a traits in other words we are flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure\nWe're defining the natural flow were to find the natural order of things and you got to believe that when you take on Mother Nature member the commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nOf on yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine night\nIt was very mired in for a merger and right\nYeah and we all know margarine is not so great for like\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive trade sense suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according\nTo science you know billions of years of evolution right were we to do\nThat if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back a quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant you know and but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um I tell this story about a this guy I think his name as a Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mole which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing a industrial secrets and so for the song but he recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface that sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on it it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots powered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because he did that this technology we're creating\nWill run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the chance that the you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient\nGame around go you know I probably won't smoke you\nWrite in artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed the writing is on the wall e is I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers are not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there is no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we both are we want post about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... they're just putting it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than art of the day of the singularity that's for today on all singularity him one day we'll have the equivalent IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah I think that they're teaching these are the Jewish you ... the equation is which you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go like you won twenty bucks\nBut at the smarter machines get the more the

I Know several people who have a ...\nWho has a trouble walking or they have lost their ability to walk and they've been spinal injuries and and that this to them is a dream I mean the I ... just being able to walk across the room because of a of an exit skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\nOf I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that there's actually a movement called the trans human movement where\nAs you say they are the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories that they usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power line when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms zap them right off\nNow here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely cripple and and now scientists are creating for him what are called neural off the prostheses\nBut the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we are mechanical\nThat requires you to wear harness and you have to ... you\nKnow these are these are arms that he can move with it they're they're they're wired\nMine and I mean isn't fantastic oh yeah\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you\nKnow she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you and even even in\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with stuff there you know where you know write it get it get it you know so so or soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off of their own skeletons I I think that's a I\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that I\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can if we could come up with the technology\nUm that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about\nMaybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me that I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one better and inevitably as a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting if you look ahead to what\nThis technology is pointing to [noise]\nAnd uh you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I call that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I called them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon or using neuron that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes do you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not shoot another word to give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment ago you\nWere going to be now and another escalating arms race right yeah ... ... in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know\nAll this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we are just still the same you know all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and and I and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but to Sarah Connor tuna ... which means you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the euro opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla and just creates more terrorism\n... you know I mean that that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending ... Terminator but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to\nYou know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going or at his weaknesses\nBut but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old hand on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay well we had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's put that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween he kind of moments right there were like All right now there's\nThis is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with it I could understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end in how far along are they in the pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed the monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nMaybe it there in the ... they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor it that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our country I just had an op ed is going to be published very shortly\nI'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so I think that um the Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nHer as a kind of a your fridge raider your dishwasher everything that's going to do\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on\n... there are now I'm more than a billion Internet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show he thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how you came in\nHe killed he killed his wife in the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a wire\nHanging onto the thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join in the ministry the end of life as we know it might go Guillen next on coast to coast am in for George Mallory this was he in on it [noise]\nUh [noise]\n[noise] [noise] on the half [noise] when it breaks [noise]\nI married caffeine live from the campfire twenty four hour newsrooms and suspicious package has been sent to the office of senator Kamala Harris and Sacramento staffer say it was similar to those sent to other elected officials and others suspicious package intercepted ...

[noise]\n\nI'm Michael before we start getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before we get because I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet chi walk\nAnd it didn't square with the story from the husband and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where a great science writing and science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time so that you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into our DNA when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense and it's a fair and ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah yeah we have a little give it a little walk for an up [laughter] they're I think the question you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation it talked about in mortality and when the wrath of God or out of upon Lance Hi it says that they will pray that they would die\nAnd they were not able to and they asked for the the mountains and stones to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this period that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether it's immortality would be a blessing or a curse or you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray a ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible\nThat might give us some glimpse or some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jive\nWith what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nAh and and so I I I'd love to think for about this reference the revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question\nOr a mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a ... of human like robot but get so complex and soul yawn\n... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it you know it's like the sky net running it's like running on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the ... thing or for the crush souls of the people at stumps\nOn an ... you know getting ... getting some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right have you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know the ... a piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher fixed so ... that actor is exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with a I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject\nOf immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast saying David\nGoing hey my question for example and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives it sounds like a really

Would like to know from your guest or where do you feel that the shoe will be overcome through ... or or or maybe a genetically modified pigs\nI'll take my answer off the air and\nHang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is he on he's on dialysis is on kidney stones and he has macular degeneration\nDislike my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now uh with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though her fight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but\nWe're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about\nThat or is already working on a second generation a that will help actually restore sight to people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also and the kidney ... I don't think we need to create these primarily\nA there's a lot of great research and I've reported on for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell\nOr ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology very hopeful\nAnd that's where we left ended with Michael deal in the book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and for your joyful spirit and looking forward to carrying on a with open lines next on coast to coast am this busy in front of it [noise]\n[noise]\nTo play you big reel movies each week to fill your virtual theaters the box office crime [noise] so do you it's easy to blame but hard to master compete against craze in other movie fans for the chance to win free movies signed posters movie props and\nMore ready to give it a dry download the fantasy movie began to start playing today [noise]\n\nEver forgotten the password for misplaced your cell phone or team\nThat's what every day feels like for a person living with Alzheimer's all signers Los Angeles provides free services to families and caregivers and greater LA and the Inland Empire\nUntil there's a cue or we provide to care [noise] call go online for help to donate more to get involved at age four four H.

aware of nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I [noise] it's impossible because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's bad enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue that sold peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say in it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were like we did have a soul\nIf other people out there have you know\nUh other men if there are other people who have a ... problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease you know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human than they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology on soul\nUm but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about test to babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I and world power guys first of all for not let's say five years I don't want to get too much into it but\nUm after last night I have a couple of things to say on this whole in March ... he ... her saying I'm a revival manner awarded a habit of things he couldn't that that were to survive\nI mean we even know what to do and I said environment now and furthermore it our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first survival situations and\nThere are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know highly compiling surprise for\nThree years to come for for that is families with multiple wives with multiple showed her with multiple multiple and um and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not\nThese are usable and we don't know even with\nTraining we don't know if\nThe supplies which says ... somebody in a cave or in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt your on your way to um fallen scare myself\nNot to consume companies suppliers but just to ... myself and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer\nA myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just see somebody could even\nSustain themselves editors do you don't really know even with things like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know what's going to survive it could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid\nWho hasn't had any training on how the year the supplies that are stored up with colds or or whatever um\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are\nA latter day saints and so I just really be a clear for people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do but to her point I was watching on Netflix\nOr there's a series called uh like the men with three wives or three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade a Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife and then the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab\nAnd um and that they they've already talked about saving up than having enough food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and what it even work Kennedy even work I don't know\nI'm ... but uh yeah so Aaron's willing to be a volunteer but um I think the only thing

claim is that the the the marches on purpose or coordinated toured us I mean I\nI think that you'll always see migrations in the long history just to bring up the Bible again\nThis is that we're all

to art bell and I've tried to call in a couple of hundred times this first time I've gotten three this is such a great privilege but if I can and I would like to share something about the Bible\nA and there's a great truth that we need to realize in any discipline uh\nAny discipline that you study whether it be science or whether it be a Bible for instance uh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a drink\nAnd the and the Bible is something to be studied and pondered over all three of the model the estate religions from the middle east began their roots what Bible quoting the Korean the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\n... and the new test and the New Testament to the ... yeah I mean the story the story of the prophet Jesus and the current is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the car and all of that validates not counting the historical\nValues a historical cruise you know that that line up with a so many of the stores in the Bible a mini the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nOf the historical value the book Daniel is so accurate\nAnd ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much of the future as he as he did but that that\nCruz when you look at the courage there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the Old Testament and the New Testament this has done so much for humanity\nYou know I I I agree we yeah we stray\nAway from that and people and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right that's terrible whole book or you know and they'll a settled in\nAnd you know it's called proof texting and it's a yeah it's there's a there's an old saying I've I've said it before I go to ... but as soon as the first in St learned in seminary was that some people\nSome people rely on\nA on scripture I'm like a drunk leans on a lamppost not so much for illumination but for support and I think it's the illumination\nPart that I always go far enough to support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just it sounds like you're a learned guy but I did a I'm\nA I was writing I wrote an article about a ... about the true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told [noise]\nAnd I was interested in how many troops um how many murders stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that it starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what the murder stories still do\nWhat I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder with regard to Jesus\nThey where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the ... of the Bible and the New Testament the Greek word says kill but actually the word that's often used\nUh the Arabic word is the Jesus who was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it and he was murdered and I don't think\nMurder comes up a lot when we think about him in a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out yeah I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did the ...\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity\nHas a you know or Christianity\nFor higher so to speak where people are wanting to build a legacies ... do you think that that has hurt us and gotten us away from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always been the big difference of shooting a bullet in the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God\nAnd I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter] I'll take the bullet in protecting somebody else I'm a ... you know people do look way far on to

last of the second to the last that I Want to ask are you in Manhattan, Kansas now\nI'm doing essentially a word study right and so I'm looking at the at the Hebrew I'm looking at the Greek and I'm

significant that the the ... murder is a very very very big deal in Islam\nIt's not it's you know people often talk about Islam and there was you know they make all these characterizations about Muslims and it's it's really unfair because murder any kind of death anytime you're killing something that's a big deal in Islam\nAnd so the fact really the elevation is really my point was that they were elevating the death of Jesus by using the word murder\nOr they weren't pulling a punch and I think that's cool um as for um as for other things yeah no I think you're you know that's an interesting thought I Can't get in the mind of the\nOf the Bible writers who felt like that was but I I Know that sometimes murder is sold softly and the Bible the word murder exists they exist or

I didn't want to a wrap it up quickly are there's a lot of could go into a bucket for a wonderful story um I I agree with non record of what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier with different color um something about ... along the lines are\nOr is it your your critics creatively how are we we all worship or something you know whether it's money or her metabolism or whether it's our him or her so um that we really appreciate that freedom if you're if you're if you're a worker you know where\nI I I appreciate that but I also think that there's a downside to the river sure because you know we have the freedom but we don't always use it responsibly oh yeah we haven't really not individually or can we collectively\nCouldn't agree more have some kind of shared values\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political here I I think what holds us together as a country is a\nI don't fixate on borders I understand the importance or security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut when people talk about it the border that makes as a country that's just not true you know it's not the border that makes me in Arizona and write or soon to be a a a cans and there's been a ... crossing the border that exist on a piece of paper\nThat I think would hold us together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have ... ... there can be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to philosophy should be where every education starts I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers base the entire country I think that's\nWhat we need to always focus on that's the that's the most important thing to other things are also important is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot\nAh for people who don't find it interesting pardon the blood other but gosh darn it those great thank you so much for jumping in an open lines and a look forward to borrow night so the most elusive serial killer\nIn history\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case\nPolitical make that decision I Want to think a George ...

exporting more stimulating Todd [noise]\n\nHalloween is always the perfect time to be listening to coast to coast am and we will not disappoint both tomorrow night and tonight or coming up uh again tomorrow night the uh the book that I think you will love hear the story of the men from the train\nAs scary as that story is um it's still not as scary in some respects that some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael Guillen was going to join this just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd if you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also\nThe ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunted place in America and uh and when cameras captured ghosts all of those stories are in the news segment that coast to coast am dot com but there's also this other story on the top of the fold right in the carousel\nOn the top of the website it goes to ... am dot com and that's this struggle play a little bit of it here give me a heads up on it 'cause I'd love to get back to this coming up later on in the show wrote in\nDowntown Oregon City here are very funny at least that's the theory\nBehind paranormal activity witness that finds erode treat a candidate dispensary\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that Andy going that's next to it as capitals\nOver positive here for a new we'll just get back to that later on but you can go see the whole story and coast to coast am to come and look at the video and then try to explain that coming up later on okay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencils\nI don't know you you believe me there there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel bono prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell ah you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day it's going to do and my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that and that's why I asked you a a\nA later on or you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in elite group of science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific tell me and you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and they're very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nOr ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is just very I Love it you know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list in urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... but I mean yeah I what what\nIs the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America corny corny Nightline and you know you have\nTo you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that as far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth and saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAgo and I was reading some of those tensions in I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect\nFrom Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else [noise]\nI think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Ilan mosque or being very very involved or you know he's involved in driverless cars he's evolved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got his finger in this whole neural net\nThere was a chase that ended when the driver crashed into

at Harvard as well as author and the new book is uh is is just great it's a the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which might be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of at all you have to ask you know do we really want to\nIt is and there's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering what we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade and\nWe're drawing a traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural flow were to find the natural order of things\nAnd you got to believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that the one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial\nWas margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right\nNow and we all know margarine is not so great for us right [laughter] but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive trade sense depressing dominance trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we\nHad to pay a price and he had to\nDo that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we to do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty\nThinking we are yeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know and but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy or a peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the in some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um I tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about feeling a industrial secrets and so for the song but he\nRecently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on it it it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they can control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because he did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the chance that the you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYeah ... you\nWrite and artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off her her you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there is no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we boast about are we once posts about being very good at about well you know like you they're ... it just putting it up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seemed to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day when all singularity him one day we'll have the equivalent IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and that I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is which you you said a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get then the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I used to go to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly the imagine so\n... are like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know\nThe old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers yes raising was at the right now I fully believe that completely senator and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour because I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships\nI think our life as we know it is much more

I Know several people who have a ... who has a trouble walking\nOr the ... lost their ability to walk and they've been spinal injuries and and that this to them as a dream I mean the I ... just being able to walk across the room because of a of an exit skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\nOf I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess\nA ... where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's it there's actually\nA movement are called the trans human movement where as you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched to a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms zap them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you\nKnow of severely crippled and and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we are mechanical\nThat requires you to wear harness and you have to ... you\nKnow these are these are arms that he can move with his ... they're they're they're wired to his\nMind and I to me than fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you\nKnow she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you and even even and um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it get it just ... you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off of their own skeletons I I think that's a I\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing and he's soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm\nAbout maybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one better than inevitably the new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and uh you know we're talking about in ... a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go run there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes do you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words to give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment ago you\nWere going to be now and another escalating arms race so right yeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know\nAll this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we can't are just still the same you know all our faults and our ... our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor tuna under which means you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the euro opponent you go unconventional\nAnd you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism and so you know I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending randomly and there were some terminal but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to\nYou know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nOr at his weaknesses\nBut but positive for setting because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old hat on a new body\nRight yeah yeah okay or had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween he kind of moments right there\nAnd like All right now there's this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I could understand if somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the\nThe the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now embolden or by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic ah you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nThat kind of a ... your ... your dishwasher everything that's going to do\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now a more than a billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book and the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to ... to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show he thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was finding one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife in the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nHang onto the thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a the these women wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet chi walk and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make them they will have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like do the work [laughter] so I mean I think some of it as an education piece and and I think that's where great science writing and science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time is on the bed and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into our DNA when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense ... now into my\nQuestion before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will yeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] you know I think you can you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God or out of finance high it says that they were afraid that they would die\nAnd they were not able to and they asked for the the mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this period that you're talking where we've achieved get more\nOut of this is this is an interesting premise again is whether it's immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray a ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible\nThat might give us some glimpse or some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe\nWith what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nAh and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot ...\n... we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's in the form of a big computer server or it's\nIn the in the

Kenmore elite dishwasher ... so ... that ... those exactly where I'm living and by the way to as somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject\nImmortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in mind let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast saying\nIs it going\nHey my question for example and the ethical and moral
