all she really ever wanted how\nImportant Marion or the dreams for communicating what's a dead\nIs very important if somebody died in there was unfinished business\nBecause if when that person comes in your dream you can ask them ... or apologize to them or what it what happened why did we break apart anything like that the same thing somebody that died violently or was murdered\nIf I Can't get to that funeral before that spirit crosses over I Can't give the any law enforcement agencies any information\nBut if the person that was murdered comes in your dream and it was a relative or a friend\nThat's what the heck happened and\nYou'd be surprised how much information you get from them and unfortunately they still don't know the lottery numbers\nNo no no\nIf they do they're not passing them on exactly rent for a lot of people who were brand new to the show maryann in uh want to get to know you a little bit better you've had this gift since you were a little girl correct old were you grandma realize\nThere was a little over two when I could see and talk to earth spirits the problem is most babies and children can which she didn't realize that when I was four she started taking me to funerals\nSo that I could talk to the relatives that died and Italian\n[noise] everybody's\nRelated somehow and so you know I was Graham a special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never skill to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body in the gifts good but he was he was talking to me and I you know\nThere was no question I Would ask the question was relative would ask the question what they wanted to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever is the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nDefinitely old enough that back in the day they had ... and these\nYoung they did they did hire people who\nAnd everything else on carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared the bejesus out of me it was a dead person as the white person 'cause I never understood\nI thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong with\n[laughter] did you perfect use\nSkills as you've progressed or did uh did you always happen like that\n[noise] no I think that the older I got the easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is\nAnd then in ... even though I've done this for so long I can learn stuff all the time\nAnd so it improves every time I really believe that it does it takes me about three seconds now to open a white light make a big enough for somebody to walk through I can keep it open fairly long if I'm doing a place like a hospital or\nAn airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over the counting toward um gosh there was all kinds and there and I just had I learned how to keep it open long enough\nAnd it was it's one thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and it's crazy as they found a younger daughter ... can do this\nAnd that she doesn't do it my way because she just got one of the the people in our eyes she just wants to hear about so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop that how you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you've been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that has happened [noise]\nI have been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five thirty years ago that happened a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of them might say\nCheese and at our house is if I thought it goes to kill me I Am certainly not stupid but\nI remember I was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor and sweaty into fiberglass garage door he had no idea how that works with that yet\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the catch garage and I remember sitting on the top down and going man what are you doing here [noise] and then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to get them more energy I Can't rocking to how to be afraid\nBecause that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them and I ... and the bottom line in your dead and now I'm a line I\nGot a step over you bud and you know I Can't ... throw you into the white it's still free will but you're gonna leave this health one way or the other\nAnd now that I'm older you know and I was fourteen Twenty one twenty by telling a fifty five five Seventy five year old man just said look at me and go should girlie not so much anymore like tell him to do something they usually listen but I'm usually older than all of them have you ever have\nYou ever come across Murray on the double\n[noise] I think that I have seen him maybe three times or one that we're so evil that they had come from the black cool yeah and\nI was ever run across that situation now I really\nTry to protect the family the best that I can and I actually get a

that say their game and now just that they can take care of that more power to him\nHe don't perform exercises and things like that\nI Do that I people have had um possessions where I had done that and I actually stopped doing that because every time I Would do possession I Would end up leading somewhere I Would get scratch\nOr or look like a ...

she was classic action\nOh wild and she was a little whip up I think she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm studying because it's like oh my gosh\nAnd ah and she was found and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios rafting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James they it's a mistake or some one of the cameraman said who is fat\nAnd James mistake of saying some old time movie after all\nNo oh yeah he knows better than that of course he\nDid but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going I literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it and\nI she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's it going for ya if anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead and she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went to the light\nAnd she said\nHuh and I said have you talked to other people like people she said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go but you show up and talk about an inch she went in the light so\nI Hope that we the people that when I get up there she screams union\nMovie culture guys in the the little ...\nLittle lady kept showing\nThem like don't go home I won't ... why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea I\nI thought that they hit possessed or tricked her something sounds from his way to get the ... changed her personality\nOr should they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when I go with Bill was being shocked\nFor somebody to buy it out there in LA and uh the person that would take me around took me to this this health of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house and so\nIt turned out that they knew who the Gulf was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't do it right and so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was a person on the enemy feel whore house he says\nAnd and uh and I helped you know work on that and I looked at him like such a school ended my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked\nAt me I says why did you fly often the addict we're going to have to do with anything and he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill I said I had nothing to do was go I\nNeeded to exterminate or medical\nPerson I says why did you even do that it's like just the two things that

you kill yourself if you were murdered who did it you can get that information but if you have a bad dream about somebody\nThat is you having a dream about them that is not them in your dream\nDo you understand the difference [noise]\nIt's you having a dream about them because if he had crossed over it would've been a good dream so being the way he died I could see where you would be anxious and have dreams that would be you know not nice dreams because of the way he died or the way you find them\nBut I I Do not believe that he is crossed over if that's the kind of I mean that that was not him in your dream\nIn your dream state can you be deceived or trick Marion\nNo I Do not believe that I think if there's an upsetting dream again or if it's a dream of somebody that died that was not a

I Hope that wouldn't cause problems it uh uh but that was the question and uh what what do you think I had a little anecdote or two afterwards\nYou mean if if the the the individual uses the language or the ...\nYeah yeah if I you know if I was angry at ... and\nYou know when I when he was I wouldn't use it try and try to stay away from who\nRight yeah but I mean could that caused a curse on somebody like Fifteen Years later you\nMaybe it depends on how powerful the individual is\nOkay and then um as far as uh uh uh I don't know what I mean the idea of energies shopping or something I noticed that uh in in myself when I feel kinda awkward and the uncomfortable or around people if I think if I felt that sort of a White House generating not visible light\nBut infrared warm you know and you're not supposed to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy either way either ... direction he I mean he was on or off\nWhen he was on a lot of people love to be around him when he was off a lot of people wanting to be\nAway from it was amazing how that kind of energy works both ways positive negative next up we're going to rolling in Springfield, Ohio east of the Rockies hey roll and thanks for\nCalling morning our way today we are fine thank you hope you are to\nOff Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local like\nI'm not far from where I live probably within an hour has friends come over that person I worked with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go up a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up he I dislocated\nIt I thought well now a as well you might as well get up move around on it all\nAs otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably how now maybe another thirty miles from\nWhere we were there and uh I was like whatever you know I got the late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar a they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like everybody in there that was in that bar well focused on me I didn't understand\nWhy at the time you know and I thought well what the heck stuff about\nLike a bar full of empires or something\nYeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb\nOr at the water right and tied up on a rope or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go\nSo they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean that was an old dad gummed CD bar yeah and I went in there with them\nAnd to this place and that was a bunch of old\nPeople that there again I felt that often enough and the air\nAnd I told them I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I worked with him um and ah yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three is no warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out so we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in a car\nAnd they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a were off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backwards or there was like six or seven of us in the car\nAnd they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum\nSo they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what or there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening\nAnd the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people and and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah our father who art in heaven hallowed be\nThy name leaves are doing that under my\nIn my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer\nAnd it was weird because\nThose guys uh this one girl that was what this dude and I went up there with [noise] she looked at me and I was an honoring a word she says are you crying\nAnd I said yep [noise] and she goes to eat better she knew what was going up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like\nWow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we are that's hard pulled out of the bomb while we were stuck now at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that thought of the lord\nJesus in my heart what you had these strange virus about nothing is\nGoing to be stronger than the the like in may\nWhat do you think that ... role in what do you think there are game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe try to um where they were somebody and do um\nWhere they're going to kill you [laughter] I don't\nThink so no I I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to\nUm when me over somehow or another 'em\nLike they wanted your soul\nIt was weird I I had talked to this only to my therapist one other time but I definitely felt\nAn odd president I'm I'm very uh intuitive anyway and ah it it just something that struck me as odd\nUm what oh it's because of the experience in Dakota going through several days of feeling like this I mean it was a horrible feeling George I mean I hate to say even think about it but I couldn't stop thinking about\nGod or hands and all of a sudden I put myself into a trash and I talked to myself that is low Brian shooting up or the ... with my own spiritual\nAnd what you know I started coming out that depression and Georgia I'm just just playing right now

noticed that are in myself when I feel kinda awkward and the ... uncomfortable or around people if I think of myself as sort of a White House generating not visible light\nBut infrared warm you know and you're not supposed to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and are you talking about energy this guy either way either ... direction I mean he was on or off\nWhen he was on a lot of people love to be around him when he was off a lot of people wanting to be\n... that was amazing how that kind of energy works both ways positive negative next up we're going to rolling in Springfield, Ohio we used to the Rockies hey roll and thanks for calling\nMorning our way today we are fine thank you hope you are to\nOff Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local\nLike I'm not far from where I live probably within an hour\nHas friends come over the person I worked with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go live a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I just spoke\nHated it I thought well now a as well you might as well get up and move around on others\nAs otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh I guess it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and hung out with people for a little while and uh they all want to go to a bar probably how now maybe another thirty miles from where we were\nThere and uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening\nAnd a wintertime and we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar or they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar well focused on me I didn't understand\nWhy at the time you know and I thought well what the heck stuff about\nLike a bar full of empires or something\nYeah exactly and it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb\nOr at the swatter bright and sign up on a rope or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real aren't comfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go\nSo they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was an old dad gummed CD bar yeah and I went in there with\nThem and to this place and that was a bunch of old\nPeople that there again I felt that often enough and the air and\nI told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I worked with him um and uh yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a were off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward charge there was like six or seven I was in the car\nAnd uh they've tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum so they decided they were going to walk up to this house\nAnd see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of\nWhat people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people and and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was\nAh our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name leaves are\nDoing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer and it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up there with\nShe looked at me and I was an honoring a word she says are you pray him and I said yep [noise] and she goes we'd better\nShe knew what was going up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like\nWow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that's weird that's hard pulled out of the bar and when we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that thought it was the Lord Jesus in my heart\nWhat'd you had these strange Myers about nothing\nIs going to be stronger than the the like it's in may\nWhat do you think that ... role and what do you think there are game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they want to somebody and do um where they're going to kill you\n[laughter] I don't think so no I I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to um when me over somehow or another 'em\nLike they wanted your soul\nIt was weird I I had talked to this all into my therapist one other time but I definitely felt an odd present I'm I'm very uh intuitive anyway mhm\nAnd I would never ever think it would be you\nWell that's the thing with the energy which is right now I surprised me to\nJoe or I was in a state of depression that's actually where I hate to say about ... a lot of going in on it I'm not saying it would have some chicken I gave him a gun away so it wouldn't do it how to go on that smart\nYou even think about that get rid of the gun\nOut as a matter of fact I yes it's go I gave it to my nephew either gun collector named shooter is right but anyway\nUm what oh because of the experience in Dakota going through several days feeling like this I mean it was a horrible feeling George I
