effectively let's check and check in with Dr Gary right now we're hearing what about the flu season this year what do you think\nOr the flu season this year are you in Iowa but in discussing the flu for six years now and it gets even more confusing out the big flu virus now is called age three and two and the ... it's the big hitter especially on the the elderly but George\nThe numbers fly all over the place so the CDC is scaring us that a hundred and Seventy five children died last year but fifty percent of those had preexisting conditions you look on the flip side twelve thousand children died in accidents like cars fires and so forth\nThe confusion gets even worse when um\nThe vaccine last year was only thirty four percent effective\nAnd now they've come out with a loving flu vaccines on the market and the CDC has picked up the shop gun and\nFired away when too many hey use any one of these vaccines I don't like that do you oh no not at all because your drugstore may be offering a

you know you know the most interesting thing about this is how the Democrats pushed and pushed and finally flake perpetually or to\nYou know for an FBI probe but guess what George and there'd been no

of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and the ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nAnd then finally you know the the word gets out and the technology advances to such an extent that\nThey acknowledge it finally I mean look how how many decades that the area fifty one was not even acknowledge as being a real military installation and and now it is but even now they are very particular about how they describe it\nAnd so it seems to me that there has been a space for us all ready for a long time and that space force serve the dual purpose I mean it can make\nA the defense of earth against other earthlings I'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending\nAll earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them that are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would have destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country\nThen why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do what ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou needed to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving them to be\nSafe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah I'll I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are being out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a fear us to talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel um if they they come back and they want to enslave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever\nIf their goal is to come back here and in slavery was it might be a better fate for us to commit global suicide in other words\nAnd again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know colors on us and and work us like animals\nHit the buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo doomsday button basically\nAnd and and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan\nI'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might have been before the un you know if what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nWhat did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people banding together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to run as well and um you know the whole suspicion that

visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders\nBut there may be some some uh beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology\nIn order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do and so once we see the possible examples like I'm perhaps presenting that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them a few little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings have run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October

Nineteen years middle nineties it passed away and they were having a little show this blank check\nAnd I wasn't that close to him but I just said yeah anyway I uh I went I was late getting so\nSit in the back of the church was packed and the service is going on and all of a sudden I\nFelt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the push you a check and I looked up and it was my uncle had just passed away and he told me said John ... your car and I was a shot at it and what to do it again you said John don't value car when\nI was so scared I had to get out of there so I get up late and what he was gone\nStill you know I knew something\nAnd so I got it right now and in my next morning I called my cousin which was the so and it has to wait and they asked me if he wouldn't mind being in my car to then I'd get him right back who he shouldn't matter though so he and his go and get my car and too many kids for me\nAnyway he um and it does not cause they pull that the chick ... hit by a truck and they they weren't killed but the one thing we you know\nInjured threat I mean they had ... votes in but I never told me like this and that was really a lot to say anything that when I did tell two of my close friends and um other leg and not with the show they have the right yeah\nI guess you know up until now I haven't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving a car\nYou know what I didn't want to be told me down and\nSaid you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no that was the idea\nThat they engage in my car but they fortunately they they weren't killed but that was a ... that's the only time I had to think like a safe steroids ghost capitals and transfer them they're seeing\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks who among us right now who are uh you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all the time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like that song by the police and so when you are spirit trapped here and this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little\nA minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on but once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see the future to a degree that you cannot\nUh it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle\nAh they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms that are coming that the aunt can't see that there is more sensitive to what's happening I'm On a lower level\nSo anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who Passover\nMy definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and and this a case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point lives like a king and ... and and this is very funny because he still ...\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there\nThey were taking him out and cathartic leave releasing their pent up frustrations on him\nAnd it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck

I couldn't seem directly straight you know the core I perfectly and he's looking at me\nAnd so I start mouth and they continue mop like okay this kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering it seems like since I've been working there for about a month like he think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit to really show theirselves\nFor and he wasn't supposed to be there was ...\nI I don't think so I talked to see in a in a couple of nurses and they told me\nThat they everyone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me the October is it's not a full moon cause the full moon I can tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHow do you know a little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they ... from what we understand no all died there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf the hospital where do you think Josh\n[noise] we'll call thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being magnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again and are part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder\nDrier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet and touched the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomena ought to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating a luminous life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind what they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro steady charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you\nFind that there are these\nVery strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and it reminds me of how something like a magnet\nHas this invisible filled around at that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that it again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something ghostly spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nAnd Josh don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody is becoming very festive\nUm it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar that ah\nI every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent\nIn North Carolina then there are in Scotland and uh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Roanoke Island and they all vanished so we now know that today is one of the history of the greatest mysteries the ah last colony\nAnd so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating Fallon and Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure contributed to the fact that ah I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your uh been again one more

coast to coast Matthew Swain what does the journalist who currently works as a research right or if in state math has also worked as a reporter for several newspapers and online outlet she's a regular contributor to the recently revitalized version of on the magazine called on the ...\nAnd he writes the anti matter column which looks at\nFringe science and the paranormal for the online magazine uses his experience in journalism\nAnd his interest in both ghost lowering the paranormal to collect and tell stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard Sayre and talking about some haunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much thanks for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that way\nOn Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up yeah\nThank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't\nInterested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a of a feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and ghost stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or did Halloween cut into your birthday when you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday ex financial I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it and kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nAre and that people have compiled a numerous books\nSo I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories and a supernatural so I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and\nAnd sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple ghost stories with\nYou know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two it turned into be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars and and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular guy\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university goes stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music there is there sort of a light hearted aspect of the stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower\nUm and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of\nAtrocities and World War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know uh all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring a what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research haunted World War two was that um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think ghost stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect in history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these go stories\nAnd then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nA you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops enormous during the Normandy invasion but you know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why\nThe the stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went to the little big corn\nOh we're accustomed to less than was in ... you know he's convinced that haunted to Gettysburg we know is fun to write I'm sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting visit because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these haunting more so than than other places um and and they're essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma of war\nAh causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some a theory that also say that you know the shock of war happens\nSo quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plant to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole\nSkeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are a profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal uh activity normal phenomena for paranormal ghosts\nUm and so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nUse their own specific battlefield that you would say is the most talented a bowl\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy\nIs extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories are especially in it might be because there are a lot of\nTourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourist there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications uh seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker\nAnd when the daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe\nTheir uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff I immediately a recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that\nAway from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what could have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences\nMy parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they\nWere starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy or you can make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess\nThat would be very that watch it with my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well\nWas just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any stories similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes\nPlanes to be

of the most startling run ins with these UFOs\nThere's a story of alone be Seventeen crew that watch to UFO track them for miles I I think almost a about an hour and then of course a lot of people consider what's known as the battle of Los Angeles was a great\nStory of a ... yeah that's an amazing story and a and usually I think the was the story was the moving Nineteen forty one with John Belushi they made it seem like it was just based on what the war department called war nerves in other words this was\nA shortly after World War two I think er I'm Sorry after the bombing of Pearl Harbor I Believe it was in February of Nineteen forty two [noise]\nAnd aircraft gunners anti aircraft guns started firing in the air there was all kinds of pandemonium a and the war department just said the the people were nervous but I found a very uh an account from a very uh good witness\nWho are actually it was a ... a professor at occidental college um later he was just a kid at the time and he said that ah what he witnessed was a huge object\nThat was pretty much just standing at ... sitting still in the middle of the ... right above the ocean\nThat these guns were trained right on it and it didn't seem to have any effect and then it drifted it almost sounded like it drifted right over his head so it was a to me that was more of a story about something weird happening in the sky let alone a war nerves\nIll and and they shot against the math you people could hear ... homes yeah anger hitting something\nRight this this person actually said uh some of the shells were landing a few feet away from them and they had a the spotlight trained on it I think there's a a pretty dramatic picture that shows that\nIt is dramatic Matthew swing with us his latest book haunted World War

aside\nWell yeah I'm I'm going to make sure I have those in there so the interesting thing about uh after World War two was you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got old them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us a lot of um\nPeople got into preserving those um\nShips those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports\nAnd and also when they brought him back to these ports they brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call him shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of goes to hunters chasing this shadow creature around the the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship base a haunted sites\nUh there there is a story about a man dressed in a white naval uniform who uh wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with um a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there\nUm and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those uh and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved them and have him back here goes and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seem to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy ... for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\n[noise] yeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element\nOf uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of of country these tragedies just seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this\nIs a a interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe that were just so primed\nUm to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew ... we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh

you come across anything that the dealt with that\nYou know I did and I I came away with a little bit of a different perspective about Hitler in the cold or you know initially I thought that Hitler was a a cult practitioner throughout his life\nBut what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial and I'm sure there'll people have\nHave different ideas and I'd be glad to entertain those thoughts too\nBut it sounds like Hitler's early a philosophy was are influenced by\nA cult groups like the full society in the real society very prevalent in a pre World War two Germany in that area\nBut what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things are not at a cult theorists but more of an incredible sociopathic nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of power a worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power\nAnd so what you see later is that a Hitler begins to purge a lot of

in UFOs and you will you stumbled into a time warp for several months ago did you\n[noise] I did in fact I broke this story on coast to coast am shooting them\nBefore I even did it [laughter] and I know that that that sounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology\nAre going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said we're of course that plays turned out to the area fifty one from Las Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nAh I mean we know how these classified projects work I mean they're classified for ten Fifteen Twenty years\nAnd then finally you know the the word gets out and the technology advances to such an extent that\nThey acknowledge it finally I mean look how how many decades that the area fifty one was not even acknowledge is being a real military installation and and now it is but even now they are very particular about how they describe it\nAnd so it seems to me that there has been a space for us all ready for a long time and\nThat space force serve the dual purpose I mean it can make a the defense of earth\nAgainst other earthlings I'm much stronger\nBut at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them\nThat are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would've destroyed is already\nIf you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country\nThen why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do what ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou needed to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving them to\nBe safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah I'll I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are being out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien\nAh theorists talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel um if they they come back and they want to enslave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever\nIf their goal is to come back here in ... it might be a better fate for us to commit global suicide\nIn other words and again I told you this is going to be dark water if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know collars on us and and work like animals we hit the buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about\nThe force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan I'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might've been before the un jumped in what if there was an alien threat [laughter] what did\nHe really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to run as well and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep I mean there\nIs something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some ah beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do and so once we see it possible examples like I'm\nPerhaps presenting that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff sadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the the earthlings have run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah fake it which

Nineteen years Middle East or had passed away and they were having a little little service blank check\nAnd I wasn't that close to him but I decided to go anyway I um I went I was late getting as so I had to sit in the back or treacherous tank and the service is going on and all of a sudden I\nFelt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the president of church\nAnd I looked up and it was my uncle had just passed away and and he told me he said John ... your car and I was a shot at it and what to do it again you said John don't value car when I was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up\nVery late and what he was gone\nBut still I Wish I knew something\nAnd so I got it right no friend of mine in the next morning I call my cousin which was the so it has to wait and asked me if he would not bring in my car to me and I get invited back home he shouldn't do is go and get my car and too many keys for men\nAnyway he um and it got in my car when they pull that that ... talking my hip my truck and they they weren't killed but they would each family you know injured threat I mean they had ... moves\nAnd that's what I never told anybody of this and that was a lot to say anything that it would it till two of my close friends and\nI'm Out of the way they're not with the show and they have the ... I guess you know up until now I hadn't told\nMe in the in the warning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the car\nYou know what I didn't want to be told me down and\nSaid you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no they didn't have any idea\nThey ended in my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a ... that's the only time I encountered in like a ... you get the same thing as for the scene\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in more than you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks among us right now who where are you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all the time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like that song by the police\nAnd so when you are spirit trapped here and this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presents and so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see the future to a degree that you cannot\nOr it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle\nAh they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms that are coming that the aunt can't see that there is more sensitive to what's happening I'm On a lower level so anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who passed over my\nDefinitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point lives like a king and ... and this is very funny because\nHe still does ...\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and ah I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there they were taking him out and get thirty ... releasing

go yet\nSo I I just got off work at eleven thirty ... and I was in like ... or the Katie hospital in Ogden and I'm cleaning and I'm hoping it's called the day room you know where the psych people come they do their activities and all of a sudden I say this will\nNine year old boy I Would say maybe ten eloquently I cook came directly straight you know just that core I perfectly and he's looking at me\nAnd I start mouth and they continue mop like okay this is kind of eerie and he pushes moving pretty hard and so I was wondering it seems like since I've been working there for about a month like he think it's maybe around October is that when the spirits really\nShow theirselves or and he wasn't supposed to be there was he\nI I don't think so I talked to see in a in a couple of the nurses and they told me that they everyone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone to watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October\nIs it's not a full moon because it's full moon I could tell you what it it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHuh do you know the little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they sent from what we understand known to guide there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf the ways in hospital what do you think Josh\nWe'll call thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being\nMagnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder\nDrier environment and I know that certainly the case in Utah so that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around similar to when you're drag your\nSocks on the carpet and touched the door knob and there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating a luminous life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro steady charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and it reminds me of how something like a magnet\nHas this invisible filled around that that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that it again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something go sleep spooky creepy ... or at very least metaphysical\nThan just don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people who've always in a bit of really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody is becoming very festive\nUm it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah I every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent\nIn North Carolina then there are in Scotland\nAnd uh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast and a place called Rowan Oak island\nAnd they all vanished so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mysteries the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating Sal on Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure contributed to the fact that uh I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your then again one more time\nOr I go to Joshua pie Warren dot com is no period after the pie Joshua ... dot com

on line to outlet she's a regular contributor to the recently revitalized version to bomb the magazine called on the ...\nAnd he writes the anti matter column which looks in\nFringe science and the paranormal for the online magazine uses his experience in journalism\nAnd his interest in both ghost lowering the paranormal to collect and tell stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard talking about some haunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much thanks for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that way\nOn Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up yeah\nThank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a of a feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and goes stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or did Halloween cut into your birthday when you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday ex financial I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it and kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher\nAnd initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nAre and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural so I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and\nAnd sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple ghost stories with\nYou know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two it turned into be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars and and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular guy\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university ... stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music there is there sort of a light hearted aspect of those stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower\nUm and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of\nAtrocities and World War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know uh all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring a what they they brought\nOr the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hundred World War two was that um [noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories\nAnd I think ghost stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect into history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nA you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops in ... during the Normandy invasion but you know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why\nThe the stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield or that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went through the little big corn\nOh we're custard less than was and you know he's convinced that wanted to Gettysburg Reno was wanted right I'm sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting visit because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma of war\nAh causes these um [noise] ... almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some of the earth that also say that\nYou the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plane to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that\nBecause these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal ah activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so hard and\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most haunting ...\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely haunted um\nThere's just doesn't ... stories are especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourists there documenting what happens but\nThe bunkers the fortifications uh seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker\nAnd when the daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers ... they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she saw these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe\nTheir uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff I immediately recognized these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that away from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what\nRegular conventional non spooky aircraft disappeared in different areas throughout that region and a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular worked uh\nFor a an airfield during World War two was ... I Believe I'm\nSomeone off white mechanic for the for the uh or yeah\nSo definitely would have known the difference between let's say a modern\nI get some Hercules aircraft and something like a B. twenty four or Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it would be twenty four bomber\nTo a pretty peculiar and and there have been other what they call goes plane flaps a throughout history and I think there was even one as I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nThe one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust like that yeah like they want to do a different time warp or something right\nAnd the reason I looked into the these are a ghost plane stories is when I was young\nMy parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they were\nStarting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy a you make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Erie\nThat one it was my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well\nEngland was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any stories similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they
