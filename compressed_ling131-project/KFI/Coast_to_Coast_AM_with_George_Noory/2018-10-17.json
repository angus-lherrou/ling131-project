body in a while but you know what to expect there and I flew it again Sam know George here you're who did you first\nAnd white it's just it had an aspect the Fillmore to them from the war has got to have that black and white uh edgy look to them and that that's what the twilight zone episodes had a in fact there were six twilight zone episode that were done on videotape instead of film\nAnd when you see these videotape episode you see how completely different they look and the rest is still black and white but they do not have that film or feel to them that he filmed episodes do and so it could take that up a notch and make a color them together and you're completely in another universe and you're not for me you're not in the twilight zone anymore\nWell that's why I think night gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately what was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called my gallery it was three stories and it was a it was kind of a movie but we kind of\nThing and even ... he's the one probably pitched it to the network\nYeah after that was such a success he pitched it and they kinda mutually pitched each other and and so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode we say ah you know ride would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow can we never wrote a book well never novel he did right you know a collection of short stories ... sure but I'm getting the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually the stories that made up in that gallery movie or they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary um some but he never\nHad the time you know that's the simple answer he was he was so busy with told me he wanted to write a novel he really did but she just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nBecause there's going to be removed or the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out or is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it\nAnd from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the point where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know they're going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be ... re introduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't allowed surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to\nWell he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a surgical credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of\nYou know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHe you know cow Serling was once asked that question and and I think the ants she gave us the best answer the gift she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own you'd never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess mine is commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays with thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said if so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know it's hard science fiction fantasy to western comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to\nDo a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype all you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know we live as youth and go back to a easier less stressful life\nWas that will be that it's just like really as kind of a stop the Willoughby as kind of a companion piece to its well distance yeah so they're both very similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that was a big theme to Serling was this idea of going back to his innocent youth in and bring him to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was a classic\nA man is absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still note to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that's ever [laughter]\nAnd uh they're just so many good Leo what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nUh he started in that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine thinks is taunting him\nAnd drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah for\nThe next day with

watching television what what do you say about the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time that routes when I was writing obviously we talked about some of the censorship but not only the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there's so many shows that are that are\nAre so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think he would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and here\nThere's certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but\nUm but I think in general he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you for sure he he would hate reality TV on the um he and and I don't say that just you know that's not just me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television Ford's time\nA rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody onto the show in the normal you know regular everyday person and they will trot as family members out there and they would go through his scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just\nDespise the the show or you know he thought it was just the invasion of privacy and everything else so the reality though and he would have but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWoolen old time television tuned to a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows way gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nThey were all older white guys you know in in I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm Talking the older white guys where did the television\nYou know it would be difficult to get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you thinking him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um\nThe field has has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about a major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know ... you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more [noise] more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that\nWas it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS CBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation or seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I have some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nIs amazing let's take some calls so let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of this sets which to me it was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer or the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish what I was wondering if he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that it that's one of the striking things about the series is is that you know of course the production level in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time\nBut of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest ah set and the so and he did he got the most out of\nOut of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make you know actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like ... of the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back under control\nHe jumps started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and\nSoon to be Robert Redford yeah yes I\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to say what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series is it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue and until the very end when the when the\nYou know spit person you know a says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was uh the lady who was having plastic surgery\nOr because of the everybody thought she was ugly in a she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and yeah\nThat's that's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there is a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode and the one that really\nYou need me the message of people was the shelter above that fallout shelter\n[noise] yeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one [noise] and uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what does what does this community\nDo when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can all get into it and they turn on each other and it was yeah that was a terrifically both on episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know I'm an episode that's a very rare episode but it was finally or eight years later I was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas do you\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great you know a great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to the half hour I'll rarely yeah okay\nYeah and then you sure it was one of the hour long episodes and it it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nOr in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on called the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh yeah it's a horrible horrible incident a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed Vic moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set a as yeah you cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation you're on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead yeah Hi\nMake a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seemed like it was very a scape fist\nWere then maybe someone stay back in the Sixers I'm just speculating if you had a job and he came home and watch the twilight zone that would be almost like an escape from your daily reality\nAnd I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really light fact my second question would be about\nYou do a little radio a promotion or are people who you know an area like shoot or whatever might be a store I may not ... you're you're here locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help him out\nYeah absolutely ... every ... already which really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a sense of your eye he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for free for people or people at the college or or local businesses that I mean as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and and you know going through his\nCorrespond to see what rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent ... every letter he ever wrote he kept in that they still exist and you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally you know personal letters signed and everything [noise] um he took that time to do that and\nIt's really amazing that that you can't really find somebody saying a bad word about Russia certainly do\nYou really can't Nick we're going to take a quick break them we're gonna come back with final phone

of people do I just feel that everything else [laughter]\nReally but you know I was a middle aged guy I was in a restaurant business I was a stock market forecaster I used to that was one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I worked at a think tank yeah parents got sick got called back to Connecticut\nAnd ended up in the antique business after a restaurant shop didn't work out well we usually working life\n... that's true but people of color collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my\nBaseball cards from the Nineteen fifties I don't know where they are I've asked my mother who's eighty nine years old mom checked the ... where are they she says George ... we gave them away\nWhat I had in the fifties every baseball card and clear that play during that period what would they be worth today a fortune\nWell Nineteen fifty two mantle card pose a wisdom great good shape your real good shape right what would you suppose your it attacks\nAll right you're running around out there in a city angels\nYou come across an old old hundred years old\nTo be out there and farmers and I just sold the house I I'm just getting rid of that

had mental saying Willie Mays mantle hell\nAll to myself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes [laughter]\nI had to duplicate so we did it with the duplicates remember\nWith the duplicates in generally your head like I had Fifteen Pete Rose rookie card\nTo orange so I ran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles and the ... what would those cards have been worse if you'd given them to him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value very much probably it would hurt the value you don't want to do that with you know you're better off having 'em sign a napkin\nYeah exactly now old football cards and stuff are they worth money to\nThat what you should be buying right now\nReally I always think if you do little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right everybody's on the baseball cards that nobody's buying football cards which means you should be buying foot bunker\nInteresting to\nWrite basketball cards I once saw a guy who had a complete he had Michael Jordan rookie cards that before they cut the cards it's called the big played he had a whole plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie guards on got\nOh I don't know what the heck that'd be worth today jeeze basketball\nCard but nobody collects football cards and you can buy and real cheap and that's sort of thing you should be but you get yourself like a ... by his rookie cup Dick Butkus card right some sort of thing if you can buy that for a couple of bucks you buy it\nI think through where homeowners Wagner card was worth

well this is rare this is exceedingly rare there's only one of the world and it's obviously a four hundred years old doesn't\nLook at how does the it is right that's not the kind of what makes things gives things value is what I called marketability ask yourself who's going to buy it you know everybody loves baseball\nBy God it's on American the love baseball one of the reasons Mickey Mantle baseball cards are worth so much as it sounds like Mickey Mouse\nYeah you're right\nBy its name the named beautiful um and he was ... right there is also a lot of people live in New York all they love

and over again a he was just unbelievably productive and he just wrote so many great great shows for for television and film\nA one of our friends marches decree a wrote a book about the twilight zone or in the subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating an addictive phone while he was floating in this pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five onward\nI don't know if he did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly dictated most of the scripts and and I was I I don't know how he did it I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly was a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nSo let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school

the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there\nAnd when you see these videotape episodes you see how completely different they look than the rest is still black and white but they do not have that film work field to them that the filmed episodes do and so if you take that up a notch and make a color than to get done you're completely in another universe and you're not for me you're not in the twilight zone anymore\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately\nWhat was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called my gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a movie of the week kind of\nThing and even hitched it he's the one will probably pitched it to the network ...\nAfter that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see\nThat kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell he never novel he did write your collections of short stories and towards those sure but I'm getting the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually the stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary um some but he never\nHad the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out a is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it\nAnd from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things on on cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for it where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know they're going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are they can be reenter reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't rod surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to\nWell he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a surgical credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of\nYou know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery or twilight zone had in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a heat you know count Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own universe or space ship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got a interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of 'em yeah back then now nowadays with thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials that's\nStill a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed routes certainly could write a story and a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah as you said if so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction fantasy to western comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to\nThrow a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype will you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know religious youth and go back to a easier less stressful life\nWas in the Willoughby or it's just like really as kind of a stop that will be a kind of a companion piece to its well distance yeah so they're both very similar and they're both among among my favorites and that was that was a big theme visceral English this idea of going back to his innocent youth and bring him to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was the classic a\nHand is yeah absolutely a classic and NSA again one of those shows that people still know to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that stuff [laughter] ever [laughter]\nAnd then just so many good the what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and starve to ever flown who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater or he started that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that he thinks is\nTaunting him and drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nFor the next day with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat

A. R. D. I. S. dot com [noise]\nCan buy a um ... more stimulating talk [noise]\n\nThen we'll come back to ... with us rod Serling his life working imagination ticket for a rod Serling were alive today watching television what what do you say about the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time the restrooms renting obviously we talked about some of the censorship but\nNot on the issues but also the language and and just the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there are so many shows that are that are are so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think he would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and here\nThere's certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but\nUm but I think in general he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you I'm sure he he would hate reality TV on the um he and and I don't say that just you know that's not just me saying that at the time I you know I guess reality television for its time\nA rod has some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody onto the show in the normal you know regular everyday person then you know a trot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it's kind of reality television for the time and he just\nDespise the show or you know he thought it was just an invasion of privacy and everything else so the reality of it and he would have but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWill and old time television tuned to a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows where you gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nThey were all older white guys you know in and I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm Talking older white guys [laughter] where did the television\nYou know it would be difficult to get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example ... thinking him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um\nThe field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about a major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know ... you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin players from all these places and how they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS\nShe just didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now do you think\nOh absolutely I have some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nJust amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of this sense which to me it was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the sort of a target for the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was ordering from Nick if he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots\nOkay ... do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with Kurt that it that's one of the striking things about the series is\nIs that you know of course the production level in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time\nBut of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you a brilliant you know spaceships or shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to\nWork with a you know more a relatively modest a set and the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make you know actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like I have the Boulder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kind of got the budget back under control\nHe jumped started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to Robert Redford start yeah yeah as I read for actually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on television\nA and that was a great great show and he was very good in it too\nIn the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to say what the ...\nThe news but that was a great show\nYeah it was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders\nAnd and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson or he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spill person you know ha says a few things\nWe found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery\nOr because of the everybody thought she was ugly and uh she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we found out when everyone else look like and yeah that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there's a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episodes and the\nOne that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above that fall out shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yes that was a terrifically are both on episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nI I you know I'm an episode that's a very rare episode but it was finally or eight years later and it was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas do you\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great and you know great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to half hour oh really yeah okay\nYeah and then you sure it was one of the hour long episodes and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated\nSo it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years uh and so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pulled the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh here as horrible horrible incident I'm a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set a it was yeah yeah cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead you're high\nLike a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seems like it was very a scape is\nMore than maybe someone stay back in the sixties I'm just speculating if you had to have a job and they came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there any other shows really liked that my second question would be about the mysterious endings which\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help him out\nYeah absolutely ... already which really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in the sense of your eye he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for free for people or people at the college or or local businesses that I mean as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and and you know going through his\nCorrespond to see what rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent ... every letter he ever wrote he kept and they still exist and you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally you know personal letters signed and everything [noise] um he took that time to do that and\nIt's really amazing that that you can't really find a somebody saying a bad word about route certainly do\nYou really can't Nick we're going to take a
