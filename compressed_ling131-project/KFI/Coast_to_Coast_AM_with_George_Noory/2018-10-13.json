Kratovil down I knew in my down time in\nEven much says check on the line for me to find that out that\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is\nAll of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody how did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional\nEnergy drugs or something\nI practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them and\nIt accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments\nSo do negative spirit\nAnd so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them we wash windows when they move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and\nSo demonic spirit's just play on that and they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs sick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whenever and doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea that first negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit a that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercise is different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes they were the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not Murthy you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent brief shining freeze exercises\nI don't belong in a particular religion because where I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared and these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work\nFor the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion so it wasn't touching anybody anyway it's really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual\nAnd so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it's it has to be done you know we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up the cumulative and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know times are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and\nThey're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it cleared out one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean your own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one a qualified extra assistance just about every religion but they all but they don't work\nFor people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know a local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of work and has lives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are\nThis universe I said before on on one of my appearances this universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you have\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which haunt me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know if

even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOh a just a few years ago um I did a free night uh than to actually at a legitimate haunted mansion very famous I won't mention the name but\nUm it's something I was\nAgainst for years and years and years for youth all invitation I finally they talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just beautiful you know\nAnd so\nUh it was essentially set up for Gulf countries to go in and uh with are quitting and and take a look around and everybody everybody following something people didn't believe in goes had you know\nOn a couple of ... their hair dryer went flying across one of the rooms and I was staying and most private room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nA first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get the cars are people on it and I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called him a bachelor but very heavy gold she it was called the golden rule\nAnd it went up to get my business card and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast\nRight in front of me just would not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my card paid no attention I said you know\nThis place has really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night I had to go with hunters warning them to be very careful about saying don't me don't bite\nMe yeah how people home negative spirit yes they will get you know it gets you later\nSo sweeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and I'm Out four feet above me with a misshapen spirit just terrible looking now I'm used to fear it's going to sue many ship why don't react to this you know the say the ugliness or the parents or something like that deliberately\nOr what thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd on but a lot if I'm wrong but I never heard\nReally I Can't it's drain\nPossible to describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil law by\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in my in the bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song slowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed it's kind of went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack\nRight away first thing I knew what it was I didn't have no idea how long it had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I wanted to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time I\nWas just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room\nYou know you just have to learn an extra sisters\nNot safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits in somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know times immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clearly not do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world they don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they called up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nFeel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling dreamed because I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always noted subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them are on negative spirit\nAnd so you know people calling me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's the media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really hard you know very very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last\nAlmost three decades now have not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things than forty five\nMinutes already find different things so remarkable and it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have\nTo look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on the business or a house\nAnd so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep\nMeaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy and also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating\nEmotional energy schools people go to school I went to this this is the same school ... elementary and high school that my parents went to its old great youthful but I mean think of\nThe energy dinner elated\nAnd so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy we generated we don't know how to release it\nTeach people how to do that you know and and so sometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes for a standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's good because it just for you know\nMarshall energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to Jay in Minnesota are welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time thank you thanks for calling\nUm

right when you deal is done\nCould be seeing things from the other side sometimes\nYou know and and sometimes not and and negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves\nWhich unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues physical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness\nOr overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line and being able to reach into the physical realm\nAnd affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across in damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of an immediate death but actually\nThe working on them for a long time and they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work I'm doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know have looked at in a you know get some light medication for it\nBecause it the demonic spirit had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is the you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be a physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm was that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and essentially that is very connected to the physical realm ended a physical realm as something like the trust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to Jim in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know the trip pant turtle like I\nGo to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens in teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said when I say now I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to see they're still your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for these\nParents out there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things\nAnd trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore the physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy and the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's not everybody's possess or anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or Republican pub whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual to save this is my main concern not are dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold to actually do things in one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability or disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because we're not ... reported that the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all those kinds of stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past lives\nHelping people that to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people\nIt's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they do love that\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey ... would you please ... you can find everything

pass them on to us and we'll get going with that too but let's go to the phones let's begin to going to keep in Virginia to get things started Hi Keith welcome good morning\nHi George ... morning thank you sure\nAnd uh on your topic I Can't believe that actually going to talk about\nA related to that from places in which people who do believe that they do believe that they saw that\nBut actually did not and perhaps her desk why that can beat 'em some possibilities okay [laughter] um I I Want to talk about a an example of that including I'm\nA doctor a Christine Blasey Ford and I'm Brett Kavanaugh who both\nAppear to be very certain and sincere in their claims\nThey did a they did and\nIn many people yeah many people felt like Dr Ford was very credible and she said she was a hundred percent certainty of accusations against him\n[noise] and uh I Want to mention um several years ago like Kansas ... cold a magazine\nRegarding Prozac I'm alarmed at the monster that I created she joined the board of the international coalition for drug awareness which was founded by\nA coast to coast am guest and collect Tracy who wrote the book Prozac panacea or or I Am for Thirty years this research government approved prescription mind altering drugs ah regarding your previous guest she actually says that ah\nAnother name for ... which is mentioned in the holy Bible or pharmacology\nI Believe and [noise]\nAnd she said that ... that actually among some of the bad effects of these got rid of her prescription mind altering drugs including ss horizon crafts and so that they create actual portal for negative dark and he couldn't demonic spirits\nBut they also a interfere with people's ability to uh have spiritual thing\nPositive spiritual experiences including belief in God some people when they go on the trunk space stop believing in God [noise] there was a boy who uh is featured in a Youtube video and like Tracy hope everybody could watch why cook them to school\nAnd in that he is uh basically described is when he went on these medications\nUm was you know waking dream state\nAnd oh he he didn't know the difference between reality and um you know his delusions and what he was doing and it almost ended up very tragically hit it going to jail for this this this boy\nLots of people do yeah but he he later you know got out a because the people knew that there is really something wrong this this boy didn't belong there they didn't believe that he really was responsible for that and sure enough you know it was going to the medications the event\nBut they believed him but the people believed him yeah and and what I'm\nWhat I wanted to talk about is what he believed that he was experiencing in this way can dream state which is common and like Tracey says about all these\nCases and David which includes suicide and domestic violence workplace violence she subtly suitcases of the school shootings\nOr involve kids that were not on not on these drugs now you know and so the bottom line is what I'm suggesting is that it's possible\nThat because some of the side effects to dilution hallucinations and I am black Tracy has a false memories center article about Roseanne Barr who accused her parents of\nMolesting her mhm and later and that was after she was on medication that is right and then later she she realized that that was not correct it all and she was really certain that it had happened\nBut uh but but then you know she\nAnd she would only ... went off of that she would have passed a lie detector test because she believed it\nExactly and so this is what a I think is important for people to know and and have as a documented thousand cases over the thirty years of the things and what I'm saying you know in in my previous call and I I didn't get to\nInclude all of this but I but basically I had a dream in which it was very good at it\nI had mentioned that you know I was told by somebody who died twenty five days before that he would feed me and Thirteen mine and I said how do you know and he said the holy ghost told me [laughter]\nAnd I I you know I knew it was a dream and but the [noise] [noise] I didn't I didn't know when I was dreamed that it was a dream of life in a looser tree but\nAfterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all that she has been consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with\nA ... dream soon she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em no you're you're\nSome little right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them if they were on any mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in ... in that case\nThat never came up but uh I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that when we got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou don't Joan okay where are you\nA um ... um I had a um a thing and I couldn't believe that I saw before I had a I had done a little these the ... and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know\nAnd um and I was in a bone in my life where I didn't really know if God was real or if the devil real all this you know and I started reading the Bible and then I'm\nGoing back to the point when I was out of jail and uh uh as God and I was like ... if you aren't real angels on everything Israel you know show me because I Would like to know I Would like the late ... so uh\nIt started at ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later then what happened\nAnd I I started in these little things like with people like I'm a little like little spirits and stuff\nAnd I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them\nRight when it seemed like everybody and he had Korean the everything he did he touch was known your favorite one like [noise] in you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's monkey you didn't have none okay now these kids that you know no\nUh that's a glass of water without knocking over something breaking it up and told me that he was going to get an angel [laughter] but he just didn't have one at that time\nAnd I'm leaving it was kind of be just to show me that you know how it works or you know and then we'll go to church and uh\nI tell my uncle about it and he told me oh you know when you go to church you know and I'm so we go to church but why would they church I won't eat them and I started the ... will will be angels like\nYou know her name on the church all over the place\nAll the way around it you know a new like there was a state

humans can transform into angels\nRide the cosmic conduit and dwell it God's throne and that's the really big question right there at George why would any why would the church have a problem with this

call one eight hundred five one five zero zero five three or go to ... beats dot com today\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThat work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed\nPeople who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional energy Dr ... practice something called modern metro system\nAnd that that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel um and it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and soda negative spirits\nAnd so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything\nBut we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whenever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises in different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a free is I Would say that I'm an independent police\nSay sharman priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways doing personal clearing so I wasn't touching anybody any ways really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know some times are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it cleared out ones\nAnd I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of the living environment so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nA qualified extra assistant just about every religion but the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of work and past lives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets\nThere are the universe I said before on on one of my appearances this universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you\nKnow do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which hold me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know if they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for we're at the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website starkly dot com his book is called

Jeffrey the scariest\nOr even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOr both or just a few years ago um I did a three nights a stand essentially at a legitimate haunted mansions it's very famous I won't mention the name but um it's something I was\nAgainst for years and years and years for use all invitations I finally\nUh they talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just they're beautiful you know and ah so\nAh it was essentially set up for ghost hunters to go in and uh with her quit and then in and take a look around and\nEverybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in ghost had you know one couple said their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nAh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cards from people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called ... but very heavy gold she was called the gold room\nAnd it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast\nRight in front of me just would not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention I said you know\nThis place is really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite need\nY'all do follow people home negative spirits yes they will get\nYou know but get your later so I was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and I'm Out four feet above me was the misshapen spirit just terrible looking now\nI'm used to ... spears can assume any shape they want I don't react to this you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\nOr what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song\nThat I'd never heard really is I Can't it's strange possible to describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil lullaby\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in my in the bed woke up in the spirit was was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song slowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed at ... kind of went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I was to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into\nThe basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room\nYou know you you just have to learn\nAn exorcist is not safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits in somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know in times immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clearing that do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments\nAnd they need a clearing and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work I'm Better able I go into business meetings and no longer coming out feeling dreamed because they're not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy you don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them are on negative spirit\nAnd silk people calling me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's immediate but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey\nReally really hard you know very very seldom\nOut of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last\nAlmost three decades now have not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already five different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client and may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround six people that is coming in for six months clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on\nBusiness or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has an effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirit demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep\nMeaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy and also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments for lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to\nIts old very beautiful but I mean think of the\nEnergy dinner elated and so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session it all depends I Do both and you know acquiring session a forty five minutes for a standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nNot so good some costs just for you know\nMarshall energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to the J in Minnesota and welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time thank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times about ... and everything else but Jeffrey you treat me extremely a great late at night and I have some questions I have some issues\nI didn't catch the beginning of the program and I'm not sure where you're from but I Am up in Minnesota and\nI have had a problem I created when I was back in the marine corps a prior to the war um after I went through that\nWhat happened often we'd you board followed me as I said it would and I've lost two families or Twenty years worth of family and so I I'm a dedicated man and I met the bottom of the barrel at the moment and I've tried\nThe problem is is that we have many ministers out there that each\nUh this type of stuff and basically do they make money off of God the problem is with the with the whole scenario as it turns people off like you are Jeffrey and and I understand that I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know that\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it said if if the relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus is title is Jesus\n... Lord Jesus Christ Lord Jesus means humanity in quite the not only did one\nOkay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on the third in fact\nIn fact either said that I'm a I I that God is no respect or person but we're all in the same boat no matter how much knowledge we know we're on the same boat with God\nBecause we have it in nature because we're we're born and stand because of Adam Gadahn because we carry out and then uh our entire life we we are in have you been all that is that that none of us are the glory of God we were all on the same boat\nBut those demons seemed to be everywhere we're gonna come back and take final calls in a moment on the coast to coast am\nGhost insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for iPhone and now enjoyed for Don ... listen live we're on demand anywhere any time I go to coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nWhen they break [noise]\nNew gas in the line from the gas I twenty flower user and lightning has been lining up to ... with the national weather service says four to five low pressure storms are moving up the coast\n\nThat lightning storm four years ago killed one person ... says the storm she clear out by Saturday evening with his art bureaucratic news two hundred and fifty residents in a city in Japan have had the same address for almost Seventy years\n\nSorry about that seems like the sound might not be working moving onto the next story Facebook says a security breach announced a couple of weeks ago gate hackers access to names email addresses and phone numbers for twenty ... twenty nine million accounts that's down from the fifty million accounts Facebook had estimate even the breach was first announced\nIt says to me it service says it plans to send messages to people whose accounts were hacked checking in which I think now from the ... center there is a crash on the two Fifteen\n[noise] on the two Fifteen freeway south and we've had a passion with all leans stopped in the San Francisco and they get their grandparents area right around delicate Dina Iowa avenue looks like it's not for the children as ... as you pass Barton road we have a crash studio city on the north and Laurel candy bars clash and fuel spill here in bowling a tanker truck\nAnd the three left lanes now shut down your jam back to the one thirty four one Seventy slid in highland hospital one ten north andme army in way this crash had all lane stopped for a couple of minutes they look like they've got us went off the freeway now Dr recovering from avenue sixty as we look at the ...

defend themselves\nWhich unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues physical brain problems a depression anger issues on happiness\nAh overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line and being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of an immediate does but actually\nThe working on them for a long time and they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work I'm doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some light medication for it\nBecause it the demonic Stewart had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark problems that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and especially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know to to repent turtle I gotta go to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens in teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to see here still your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for ...\nThat actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things\nAnd trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that any more than a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch he's going to he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's not everybody's possess or anything we just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night\nOr apartment to apartment or condo condo or republic pub whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work sold the family or the individual is safe this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold to actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing", "show_name": "Coast to
