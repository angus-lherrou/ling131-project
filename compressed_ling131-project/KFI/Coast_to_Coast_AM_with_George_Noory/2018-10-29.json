for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend and you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I have talked about that before a that might be a ... year than to men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies are due to think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I'm going to be honest with you Georgia I'm doing five books now on on this phenomena foreign demand in black and one on the women and black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and say I'm a you know nothing like the the\nConcept in the movies that typically are described as looking ... you know go on and the skin is live ... white white\nUm [noise] um people talk about how I seem to have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them pay for the even talks about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women and black of turned up in homes right after paid for being using wager boards which puts another angle to its um but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like\nPortrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a you know like a golf a horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe this but many black ministry it's fall be on you know just guys in a black suits walking\nOn you know\nI'm asking it into context sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters are that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nPretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the ... elections you know you've got a really weird ones you next play a couple and then some which are easier perhaps to explain there is a power line with the men in black where there's\nNo doubt that in some cases I think the government agencies all responsible for there might be but I think it's a very small cats are great versus the the January unexplained ones and the way the ones what I think is happening on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually have employed the legends of the men in black as a means to cover their tracks in other words the might be paid for with governments who know that many black are all too real but I don't know what they are but he doesn't prevent them\nFrom using the ... the most have\nAs a means to\nTo threaten and quiet people who who may not want to have them talking about that\nSo the government may or may not know how many black really are and I don't think they fully\nThat sort of lead us into where we're heading into the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files what the government doesn't want you to know that ...\nBook uh whether or not you believe alien abductions

forty [noise]\n\nWelcome back we're talking with Dick Redfern um you know there's an old joke about paranoia paranoia ... about something along the lines of just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean someone doesn't really following you around it's sort of the the the inspiration for this new book or yours top secret alien abduction piles\nYou talk about the world in which we live where mass surveillance is sort of a given now right\n[noise] well yeah and of course you know subsequent generation growing world wherever I've never known any different you know I'm\nA very nice you know before the Internet age will remember it was not a sort of well Why Violence that we have now and you\nKnow I think that's what I mean I'm fortunate things for future generations are going to be helping normal things probably accept it as well\nOr you know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea of the\nFear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a computer chip stuck under our skin and then they can follow us and they'd all be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and all kinds of ways but in fact they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we\nAlready have a survey was device like that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would what time and resources into only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things of that sort of healing abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what would you induction they're all about that idea with the ... too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually the official publication diet is the first to November but people can already got it [laughter]\nBut um the the reason I wrote top secret I mean abduction falls is because over the years I've collected a number of official documents on abductions which again the classified through the faith in the information act in the ... um the u._s. and finally I was in a position where\nI could actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the rate that we've yes it's another book on Eileen abductions bus instead of going just overall ground you know\nWhy not present paper with the guy to showing how falls would be put together now I'll start the book actually with the contact a movement of the Nineteen fifties which preceded\nThe abduction phenomena by just about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak but um\nGovernment agencies do ah put together falls unpaid will claim to hide in Kansas for example just about all of the contact Hayes of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George Burns hassle true and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls out putting on them one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI but yes like climate had these acts there and say Israel eons\nBut they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or governments very different two hours and bordering on communism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file\n'em is extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm ... she was about four to and so on so you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty won a with a bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he was the defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but it was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and a hill that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get waited a they don't fail rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd they get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft with Akeley strange creatures\nAnd being subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly intriguing\nIs that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around the ... Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning about to I Am an essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the car when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd this is this'll become known as the the vaguely interference phenomena where they knew follow gee what's\nIntriguing is that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised them security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond if you like of the of the royal air force I sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the they ... they promised in security services interviewed Ronald Wildman about this encounter with a with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him and the most telling intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police and this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction law in today's world but Ronald ... in the fall actually refer to him saying that yes he sold his UFO coming down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to bitch strange checked his watch\nAnd there was something about it's it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject than thinking\nSort of with the music meant well there there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around it takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and ban or that the CIA scientists study the UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people I condemn ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean Georgia down skis uh first book flying saucers of

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] give me um [noise]\nNo it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it from you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experience is unusual states consciousness religious experiences\nPeak experiences what whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of the privilege to be could be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of problem my interest and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality but as you know this on the move here in New directions by thinking about science and physics and cosmology and how is the sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to\nA lot to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world in popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remain strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\n[noise] yeah I think good I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began to book with this puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still in America seem to have a lot of\nI guess would be called spiritual beliefs they are pretty high numbers in America\nI'm believing and goes to believe in spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation in traditional religious congregations are silly Asian and traditional really with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about this how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real box offensive\nAnd other world um and spirituality and the absence a really in the absence of participation in traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTrying to think well where where people getting that these ideas where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and\nI think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about infinity a or thinking about the the multi ... thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of a mystery and wonder I think about those concepts are sort of\nUh the seed bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists would die hard times too late normally George it's\nToo late [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kind of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the in the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of well what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going\nTo another to ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a four dimensional space time a world\nAnd I'm fine I spoke about this but some of the people I talk about in my book talk about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of one dimensional object has length\nIf you then draw off last where on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions that has links and wet\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and height\nAnd then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction\nUm or a fourth dimension and this would be you know this would be an object that has links with\nHeight and something else and the the something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really the nineteenth century mathematicians raise this possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem

um you know how could this be how could how could in in my dream pocket I've seen an event that hasn't happened\nThat he he keeps it to themselves for a while but is venture discharged and has back to the u._k. where he he actually the early inventor of airplanes um and his his you can Google and Jay W done and\nYou can go go in and check out his airplane defines as his airplanes were used by the British and they were used by the Canadian military and others had it as as those countries had towards World War one\nBut he he tries to reflect on this he is puzzled by these dream he's worried about them he started writing them down\nAnd then he he he comes across basically of the like\nPeople like in ten and people who are talking about the possibility that there's hired inventions and he's reading Einstein well he's reading about Einstein he's reading for popular science and he he ended up developing a theory\nThat the dreaming self can somehow lift itself up off of our normal world um and peek into other parts I'm In the timeline or for other areas and the timeline so the dreaming self\nDreaming consciousness has a kind of a freedom\nThat are that are a regular everyday consciousness doesn't have any and he uses a lot of scientific ideas that we can talk about if you want to how he does it but he has a has a set of scientific ideas that he that he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see\nSee I'm into the future and you write these is up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know like sometimes I give talks about this and different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I've had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happened or didn't happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or deja vu a worthy you have to be in some other reality and then they come back when I was out of your ... what's the how how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well so in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on cs Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made a vat of that book but she talks about time slips on and and time travel um and so on and some of her books\nSo yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nWell for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done\nUpon is as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what climate is which is really counter intuitive and weird right I mean before I'm fine people thought about time is just linear or something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of into to the prime flows forward\nUm in fact though you know I find that a number of counter to the things to say one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience prime it's probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of her own consciousness that I find equation for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times of the universe\nI'm already exist and are all laid out in this big block we are we are kind of a passing through and through that that block right are we occupy little portion of that block but every moment in our path and in our in our president and in our future and in the future and in our future\nAnd and all of our defending future's all of those moments already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually discussion and he wants to look at it discussed in my book but you can also look at Brian Greene book he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talked about this kind of black universe so I'm done\nAnd I was laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it lays out these big issue right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how we are we to make choices on and so on\n'em and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and somebody other people in my book that as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow\nLift itself up above our\nFreedom mentioned a world ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions at one time pro mentioned the dreaming somebody could lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments\nAnd done believe that um you know using a bit of aren't buying here and a bit of you know hinting and higher speed philosophers there I'm that's what he believes will happen and some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and you can we can talk about that as an additional facial dimension or we could talk about that is\nNow maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he's got everybody everybody's sleeping so had this degree of freedom and he also believe that everyone if they haven't kept a journal by their bed or their dreams and and they follow you had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nYou believe that everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contained different pieces of future events and half of them I'm sort of mixed up together\nWell I guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about the science is a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have a discussion on this program before might fit

... you know which is\nUm and that that's another fantastic scientific concept that there is not proof for there's really not proof for that idea but it it is and has become a kind of an appealing

you're going to remember your dream from I think some people would say there are ways to prepare yourself but done done system is pretty simple just keep a journal under your pillow or on your side standing right when you wake up\nWhenever it is right down I'm as many details you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice\nYou'll get better and better actually at remembering Adrienne Adrienne sort of evaporate pretty quickly after we wake up right we remember them right away then we forget them but his his journal and technique he said um you know helps people remember more and more details as you go through the process so that that is pretty simple technique but there there are there are others out there who talk about um dreams and dream interpretation\nThanks dug up going to take a call from a this is the first for me from volcano California the color is Brennan got good morning Brennan\nMorning with on your mind calling about is a sleep paralysis so\nI keep having episodes where I'm\nI'm I'm I'm just a little bit um I suffer from insomnia so when I get on these rules but I don't sleep\nSo through second day very well it seems like after about five or six days of this but I get on this trip where I'm going to sleep on my body is falling asleep in my in my mind's awake and I guess they call it sleep process but\nIt's almost like I go into a different universe and there's always deems that icy and usually are trying to get me and pull me out of my body and not only that I can hear them they talk to me so I'm I'm curious on what your thoughts are on\nThis just a ... you know my solution hating like ... Internet or with the ... was there the doctors will say or is this an actual dimension that during the state of my body is in I'm able to actually I don't wanna say teleport but you know something along that lines into that is very scary actually\nYeah yeah yeah that right it's like yeah I think like you and call you\nRented let's let's let's Christopher respond thanks Bernard for the call so does sleep deprivation lead to other realities I Wonder\nYeah yeah um well he mentioned the word sleep paralysis and he also it seemed to I I thought I heard him say consulting doctors are we compete in there there is a category of sleep relatives and there are there are things that happen when people are falling asleep or waking up in the sleep browser thing is it's scary ... is a very common\nYou know people wake up and they can't move 'em\nYou know and it can I think I Believe that can be accompanied by\nSeeing things and and hearing things and so on so\nYou know uh if the question is you know is merely a a physiological biological um [noise]\nIssue or a problem or is it somehow opening spiritual world I guess my answer is I don't know I think that if you if you do look on line or consult the doctor they will they will tell you what I said which is yeah these the kinds of things happen and sometimes when people are wake there in a kind of an in between state of consciousness\nI'm you know and that they'll talk in terms of psychology and neurology but\nUm is it could also be um an opening to\nRealities of their spiritual realities or maybe\nI don't know you know in some cultures on in some cultures you know people have visions um um that that can be traced to you know brain chemistry or some sort of uh some ... some sort of aspect of their of their biology or the brain chemistry but I don't think that rules out the possibility that you know their particular sees your brain chemistry is\nIs is also you know and his white thank you very much

parents tonight Nick red burden welcome back\nI think I'm pretty good I you know I I thought maybe we start to ... of a sort of a broad a question for you you know when you look at the depth and breadth and\nNumber of different strange in one breast and scary being the kind of things that you cover in this book monsters to use your term\nCan't help but wonder are you know are we humans completely off our rockers to see so many things for so long so many of them that seemingly don't exist can't exist or is there some kind of a common thread or theme that ties all these things together\nWell I guess the one thing more than anything else that ties whether it's like monsters big foods um my mom you name it the yeah the\nI guess the one thing more than anything else that puts them in the same categories that they are all one hundred percent elusive one hundred percent of the time now of course\nSkeptics would say well that's because they don't exist um but I have to admit you know the thing that about one angle that kind of ties all of the so called monsters together\nIs the fact that they are elusive and I'm\nIn some cases I think you know if you're dealing with things like like monsters that can be quite understandably feel daily way to you\nKnow a forty mile long like can you know seven hundred I fates a deep um most of us don't have the money to hire a mini submarine you know to go looking for these things so that that's one of the problems we have is that um\nYou know the just the logistics of trying to find some of these things can be quite difficult particularly so when the the scientific community and the zoological community\nYour turn their heads away from these kinds of phenomena so um you know that can be problematic but um I always tell people I mean if you look back in history [noise]\nUm you know it's only been a couple of centuries I'm\nEven before a lot of recognized animals where with found to exist in the first place so I think it's important to remember that that um you know there are surprised he's still out there that much of the ... the world which still remains under explored\nYeah you have several of the creatures monsters that are in your book they're based on things that we know existed at one point beepers for example or you know some of these things look like dinosaurs that are believed long extinct that wild places\nYeah I mean they sort of all failed falls into the field of what's known as crypto zoology and crypto zoology as a child is a little bit pompous you know you you cannot sort of become a professor of crypto sue all is because there's no\nDegree you can take to be one you know it's um but if people ask me you know all your crypto zoology they'll say well yeah but the I I cite knowing how they're interpreting the word you know I'd rather\nJust be seen as like a I Know creature sake moms to hunter but uh I always think crypto zoology is a little bit pompous I'm I'm sort of pseudo science but like you ...\nYeah yes exactly but what I Would say is that it's you know when you when you're looking at all these different things you know you mentioned creatures that um we assumed were extinct or may not be I mean that relates to big thoughts on the bottom level snowman for example one of the more intriguing theories\nIs that the ... of the Himalayas the Aaron I'm of China and possibly big thoughts\nMay be a survivor relics of a giant type that didn't exist or write about two hundred thousand years ago called ... I mean did actually roam around India to back on China so they're all there is a good chance that what we're saying we thought it was on animals could be surviving pockets\nOf John ... because now\nWe don't know granted\nIf big votes um you know falls into that category because we don't really know\nHow gigantic basic as war you know did he was like a gorilla or walk upright like us you know that would give us the answers but we don't have enough skeletal material to make that sort of determination but it's a you know I think the the idea of extinctions that might actually not be extinct\nCould actually uh applied to a number of these so called ... to ... is that cold\nDogs but once lived um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know your body fight with the\nSpirit of that dogs they would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm\n... and then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k.

I spoke to were probably hundreds and hundreds of witnesses to strange creatures over the years and what I found is that the vast majority of them\nDo come across as banquet overwhelmingly down to a rational now of course it feels like they should always going to get someone who you know how ... year old tries to hope show just to find to say still just some crazy person\nButs what I found is the vast majority do come across like regular normal painful but I always think that you know when you're dealing with something like the paranormal it's important to let the rate and now when you know something to show her when you speculated and I don't think there's anything wrong with speculation providing the rates are understands that that's what it is you know\nI'm I think for that reason um you know ... that's the I think that's the responsible way to do it is to sort of look at the data and and ... and that's what I Do I put the dye trap for people to say and if I got out and says\nI tell people if I don't have a an says I'll tell them\nYou know they should they should just say ... or ... or or possibility um\nYou know I'm not going to tell people that big for some strange creature that come from the far side of the moon which I don't believe that date by the way [laughter] but um you know for someone to\nSpecifically states something along those lines is he's not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you called that's called bats watch and you share that with us\nWell yeah the the the ... he's a really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees that more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up he's not seen again and just kind of I'm just sort of baffles papal ... there are a lot of cases like that's where I'm you know something pops up and people who like want to know was that\nAnd then he's never seen again but Sam this particular case is an interesting one I'm cutting I pulled Nineteen sixty four in Berkeley Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there on the witness a mountain I'm young man named Brian Khan failed um he saw these strange creatures while he was driving along the road\nAnd it was sort of humanoid but this huge wings\nBut it was kind of Harry as well [noise] scares me and had the shining a yellow eyes\nBut the sort of the ... the hair angle\nCombined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry Potter and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like sasquatch electrically ... and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you know I've talked about that before a that might be your than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just our place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of human government operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses you see them\nYeah well I'm going to be honest with you Georgia I'm I've been up to five books now on on these phenomena foreign to many black and one of the women and black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI NSA\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies that typically are described as looking ... you know ... and the skins like\nWhite white um um people talk about how they seemed to have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them pay for the even talked about when they're in close proximity to them like full and sick afterwards almost like a like a super naturally infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black of turned up in homes right have to pay for using wager boards which puts another angle to its um that's there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's\nThat's how I Would sort of describe but very blunt mistreated Bobby on you know just guys in a black suit or something you know\nI'm asking it into context sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans in helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are\nTearing up the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction falls but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or rather investigators\nOr I mean I think you know when you talk about why should you know you're going to be really weird one in a couple of them so much easier to explain there is a parallel with about a black guy but in some cases I think\nThe government agencies are responsible for them I think I smoke degree they genuinely unexplained one of the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support\nIt over the agencies might actually unemployed the legend of the men in black I was amazed to cover their tracks in other words\nBut maybe they would then government noticed them anyway but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them from using the election demoted resume to quite a\nBit I don't want to I've been talking about that guy says the government might actually don't know I Would imagine black really are I don't think they fully\nBut that's sort of lead us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files where the government doesn't want you to know that's ... latest book\nUh whether or not you believe alien abductions are real the files on the elite abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on there based on some of the real life documents

Redfern or you know there's an old joke about paranoia paranoia ... but something along the lines of just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean someone doesn't really following you around it's sort of the the the inspiration for this new book of yours top secret alien abduction piles you're talking about uh the world in which we live where mass surveillance\nIs sort of a given now right\n[noise] well yeah and of course you know subsequent generations Tyler do growing world wherever I've never known any different you know I'm In\nFavor of the night before the Internet age will remember but um it was not that sort of worldwide surveillance that we have now and um\nYou know I think that's one of the fortunate things for future generations it's gonna be a chopping normal thing for them and probably accepted as well\nOr you know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea of the fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a computer chip stuck on to our skin and then they can follow us and they'd all be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and\nAll kinds of ways but in fact they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance devices like that we all can carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would put time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things so that's the word alien abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what ... alien abductions are all about that that idea which seemed preposterous are too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually facial publication guy she's the first to November people can already got it [laughter]\nBut um the the reason I wrote top secret I mean abduction falls is because over the years I collected a number of official documents on abductions which are painted classified for the fame Information Act in the u._k. um do you ask them primary I was in a position where\nI could actually sort of put the book together you know provide the rate we've yes it's another book and I live in a Dutch but instead of going just overall ground you know\nWhy not present paper with the guy just showing\nHow falls or be put together now I'll start the book actually with the contract a movement of the Nineteen fifties which preceded the abduction phenomena by just over ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak but um\nGovernment agencies to put together falls on paper planes have had I mean I ... for example just about all of the contact taser but not change\nThese like Georgia ... George Burns hassle true and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls out putting on them one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and see Israel eons\nBut they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or government is very different two hours and bordering on\nAnd I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George fans hassles FBI file 'em is extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm over ... she was about four to and so on so you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty won a with a bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he's a defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but it was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn fool around his book on the case they interrupted journey now\nIn the story of basketball and a hill that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get weighed a they don't feel writes the you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd they get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft would they be strange creatures\nAnd they subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly intriguing\nIs that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around the ... Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning back to I Am an essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nOn this they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomenon where they knew follow Jake what's intriguing\nIs that they they uh British police force actually handed over the investigation because they reported it to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised in security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce I sort of get involved in espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the they ... they promised in security services interviewed Ronald Wildman about they think cancer with a with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him and the most telling an intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police and this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of\nSounds just like you know the whole missing time on gold of abduction law in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO coming down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of felt a bit strange checked his watch\nAnd there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely in the fall but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking\nSort of with the music meant well there there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about him the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and winter Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around it takes it seriously for whatever reason\nIt makes me think of like the Roberts and then a war that the CIA scientist studied UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those books\nOh yeah because I mean Georgia dams skis or first book flying saucers of landed published in the early fifties that\nThat sold in huge figures of gigantic numbers of books were sold\n'em and I have a ... he went on the ... it's a all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type\nOf governments um the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file on her ... um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ... bucks\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by this combination angle and I'm\nA number of the the contact chase has sort of similar approaches for example again in the a K A you have the theory of society ... by George king that was closely watched\nDodgers manager ...

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this ... you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a great school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] give me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away get away from you\nA lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences peak experiences whatever whatever you want to call them so\nYeah it is kind of the privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this one ... in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it's sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the Syrian says and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world in popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a believer in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest and spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remain strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still an America seem to have a lot of I guess what we call spiritual beliefs they ... pretty high numbers in America\nI'm believing and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional relate with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about is how can we talk about those you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust sense of belief and\nOther world um and spirituality and the absence are really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and try to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about infinity a or thinking about the the multi ... thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of a mystery in and wonder\nI think about those concepts are sort of the sea bed for for a new spiritual infections and that and that's um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard times too late for me George it's\nToo late [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things and that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat was that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say a word about that for them for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to\nAnother demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a four dimensional space time a world an on science I spoke about this but\nSome other people I talk about in my book talked about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw the line on a piece of paper or a line of a one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flats where on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and wet\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object\nHas three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide\nAnd then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction\nUm or a fourth dimension and this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height\nAnd something else and that there's something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really the nineteenth century mathematicians raise this possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they've seen simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nBut that it was resolved up to manufacture standards the Boston Red Sox or World Series champ after a five to one victory over the Dodgers in
