Dave than any other guest that I've experienced since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveils a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found this true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great to have you back\n[noise] hey George I'm always humbled that anyone even wants to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nI wanted to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations that I have not ah I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books uh insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to yeah you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities some of the missing to your own life right\n[noise] you know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family are people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and [noise] there's a lot of parallels to my life a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of time and ah [noise]\nI put the in the book just recently probably because it's more of an evolution in my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people you write the Drake fighting these are the upper echelon and it it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it\nSeems to me that it's the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now\nSometimes you meet him ... due to various circumstances but in general you know call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one are you missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your book help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say within the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that's evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I'd be glad to help and ah\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families uncovered the same sort of issues time and time again and it's frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration in their voice a\nLot of common one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote the search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement reports see who they interviewed who they talked to were they searched the effectiveness of the search or the areas that they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you really searching blind\nAnd there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they treated you I was going to ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service\nGovernment entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDon't have the authority to regulate interstate commerce Governor Brown

of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the name David flight is missing for one one missing and national parks there all frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent and listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is a kennel missing project you to say all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click in and you listen if you don't know it's somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him a less effect can't missing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right um talked for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use euro in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nAnd there were dogs used in this one as well\nYeah there were multiple multiple times\nIt's just so weird um you know a lot of these cases you have to come to conclusion that somebody just snatched or a snatch the victim just they go somewhere else or they're not no longer on the spot where they disappeared from their taken um the the ones that really get to me are the ones involving kids\nAnd I there have been so many of these cases in it's in all of your books about little kids who wander off\nAnd are found impossible distances away sometimes they're alive amazingly enough but I'm often sound impossible distances away and there is no way no way they could walk there on their own uh talk about that phenomenon\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talk about these cases and a couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child found say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents think that there are two year old could make that track but that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid\nBut before this one I had a list that accumulated that probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with the case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOr four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps a another two year old in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old ... Fifteen miles away twenty four hours not possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point laughing at these numbers absolutely blown to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is and all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance\nAnd extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you just gotta set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away or watch the child with the child's gonna do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and your think your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare [noise] but I have all these examples where these heights have been achieved by these little can't\nOr they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nA yeah he's got a movie and we talked about a two year old boy that they guest he traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges\nAnd he was found face down in snow the next morning unbelievably alive and we found that got years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened\nAnd if his mom said we couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe he was alive\nYou don't have occasion the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours you have to go point six miles per hour\nBut a kid's not going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody picked him up or some something or someone picked him up and blocked him there\nWell and and the reason these cases have significant is that let's say you report on a child who's abducted in downtown Vegas\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know sure as probable somebody put them in the car and drove down there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and when you talk about this happening when the\nPeople in the party didn't see anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks and nobody else was there nobody else saw anything nobody saw any cars nobody else was there so how did that child make that distance in that time doesn't make sense\nOr in the new book uh it's law L.

of Carol Turner this was pretty creepy what did you learn\n[noise] for people who don't know national monuments are part of the national Park Service it's their property and they patrol it their national park we are there\nWell there's a location called Oregon oh Archie a an organ pipe cactus national monument [noise] and it's an Arizona far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico\nOr February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico [noise]\nDrove there and was going to take a few days or vacation and break from school and kind of walk around and she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called her [noise]\nWell I stumbled on to this case and sought some archive somewhere\nAnd I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff yeah pretty documents on the case I got the documents in my hand that I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports and they said oh we don't have any\nI said have you heard of that case no well the first one still missing [noise]\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a key teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around him and studied under at all the articles in all the reports said that they stay that she was really smart [noise]\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in theology and biology and she was working and you're a university lab tech to earn some extra money [noise]\nShe loves the outdoors hike regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence southeast Albuquerque [noise] she was driving her white sixty eight point a station wagon\nAnd she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she wept in her car that first night February first it was established that she attended an evening ranger present\nAnd at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and want smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture and asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he ... he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved to your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found carols car parked in s this canyon picnic site\nWith a note taped inside the windshield\nAnd it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February third please contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nExactly no I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second\nHe notified park headquarters advice of them that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service that you sent in to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described and reports is cold and blustery they determined care was last seen eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs month an air force base\nThey brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search every three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time the\nPark superintendent again he met Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina\nThe parents they did the care would never ever go off trail she was in ... outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second Matt Ryan told the Associated Press\nIt's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery march seventh one last push to locate curl rangers claim to\nSmell an odor of human decaying flesh off the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service put a team into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd again they have no documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils\nAnd it was three type written pages that outlines a search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane for radio what it says one additional was turned up on Monday February fifteenth too limited locations about four hundred yards the park on the south west facing of the host AJ or less\nA very strong and distinct human odor was found but no other locations\nSupervising ranger how cross of ... that's where our national monuments and one other searchers who was recently involved in the recovery of the body had very strong and positive feelings on the ... dedication of Yoder\nThe following day ranger cos after flying the area and a border patrol plane letting eat man search party back over this area again the odor was observed at the same location but only occasionally and not as distinct\nOther members of the team described it as a very weird and scary\nAll efforts were negative in search activities have been reduced intermittent patrols at this time I have never and thousands of reports seen anything described in our national park service report as very weird and scary\nFlight guys that yeah\nIt's really strange feeling they had or the fact that they're smelling when they think is decaying human flesh but there's no source where the owner\nWell here's what's as other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary so\nI'm sure all of us have spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying some time animals die smell it I don't know if that could be rewritten scary\n[noise] but uh again\nThis was her second hike into that area which she nervous about making the trip is that what she left a note where she just smart about it they never found her there was never any subsequent follow ups after that first sixty days search both of her parents are deceased she didn't have any brothers or sisters there's

community just north of Minneapolis not very\nAlmost the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called mounds view again just north of Minneapolis more side this is a cost her area of missing people that I've written about in the past\nYou had a great job he was an auditor for the state of Minnesota that for the department of revenue\nOn September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids uh went to California and it was a planned vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend he was a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nYeah the people who don't know\nThere's a series of triangles around the world and in the book I talk about the Alaska triangle Bermuda Triangle Great Lakes in Michigan in Nevada and the way I got onto this was there are some people out there in the world that are much smarter than me that I've read these books and\nPut together some very interesting factual side notes and a guy from uh Finland did some amazing work\nSent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances and your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that and then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles\nNow in the Nevada try and go down there by you it goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle and when I first got on to that I thought well this seems kinda hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a map\nI said holy crap you know it's in the middle that try and go to Sam in national park yes\nI go that's quite a coincidence so you're Seventy kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances in kings canyon and sequoia as well [noise]\nAnd when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle there's several thousand planes that have crashed and disappeared in this year is in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents that things which seems reasonable\nBut when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh do you have any specifics from the ... were you when you get into where should we just go you jumped into the cases of ear disappearances in general\nIt was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the book from Moffett Field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that's a\nI grew up not far from off the field in Sunnyvale I grew up Cupertino and I had plane flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week and it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps that\nPatrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed in there and Treasure Island in the middle of the day\nWell in August sixteenth Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting a sent out of Treasure Island where they held the world's fair was man by the Senate earners Cody twenty seven years old and an infant Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this\nWell as they depart they ah start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the feral on islands in Cody was at the controls of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a needed for patrol\n[noise] we'll both men live near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to Treasure Island for the day to leave on their ship or that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal third person that would be in the bucket\nOnly left with to the first hundred and ten minutes of the flight was normal in fact there was no communication and then it's seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles east of the Fairlawn islands\nEight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scrambled to ... to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the blimp will the planes encountered cloudy weather with a ceiling five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them\nAt ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they had to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why it was there\nAnd then it eleven Fifteen for fundraising calls Moffett Field again stating that that in LA had crashed in the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast\nOr the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb missing the gone to ... near perfect condition both motors on the ship were off even though one throw was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were life preserver over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel was in the tanks\nThe radio was in perfect condition no distress call\nFor fun and called back and they made a serious mistake no Ellie was present at Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nCoast of California had a major started almost immediately the nanny found to fishing boat and and maybe in a skirt ship all went there and drop wears on the oil\nThe when then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowd all pure fairly normal but it could go into the crowd and despair crash happened at four thirty to build your string theory three miles east of the ocean\nThe crew to not shoot and there were in crack were still there [noise]\nThere was a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there is a couple of theories that developed a ... and the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break and when we come back we're going to jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nEnded a break with the journey wheel in the sky\nMind of

the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\n[noise] so the navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board\nWhen it hit the beach originally when it hit land it drop one of its bombs accidentally that make the Olympic writer was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood\nThere was a massive search off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio box there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up and at the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch uh but that they were watching on the water there were lots of water craft in that area\nThey never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd there's an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] your point raised national park which you've had several strange disappearances I've documented\nAnd just fell the Golden Gate to a location called half moon bay in that area because I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no they're part of the northern California coast north to that point raised area [noise]\nAnd nothing immediately south half moon bay so it's this one area that has just strangeness attached to it\nAnd like you said that they came up with some explanation for to me that were laughable\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened\n... what do you think your [laughter]\nWell I'm just\nIt's asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left or the craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\nOr even if they've come out of their life jackets they would have recovered the jak right because the the area of the water that was searched up there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so\nOh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get into that if I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick ... case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was the organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened in the winter basin\nAnd the circumstances were it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them uh their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I've thought the same thing in multiple missing poor woman books that looks like people are snatched down of the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these are odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you followed the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by\nPentagon or to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch in elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside\nHe had a had an ongoing interest in getting Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked uh ask me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch\nAnd I asked a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\n\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone uh he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the the public has never seen so\nYou know he he has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how\nYour a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wakeup call [noise] think so um [noise]\nSo you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to a different currents that could stick my teeth into that could related to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but\nEthics seated before sometimes I think\nI related to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers are ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it and I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you\nOne of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it's your filled with water I have no cases from there it's bizarre it isn't Georgia isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow\nUm it's manmade lake but the ones right in the middle of the ... reservation to use a control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at that lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and the objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning said that uh the the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people are brown there and ah\nSo ... you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity of the ranch who meets your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things of that sort but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really uh dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnd Michael ferocious live from the KFI twenty four hour news from a man's be killed on the fourteen freeway now I Would say to each bee starch in David ... says a wrong

philosophy everybody wants one ... one now you go to other countries where the tuition is forty you go to university it doesn't cost any money in\nThe state pays all of it so how does that work we're we're going have broken they do it for free 'cause they actually restrict students that are going in you pass into the university and if you don't make it you're not getting in there\nActually is a

that the higher echelons are working with the parks that won't give you information they don't want you to know and my second point before I tell you my experiences\nI'm encouraging you to read about the uh the Buddhist or teaching about these different types of creatures that live in proximity different dimensions but they can interact even thousands of years ago they talked about abductions but the ... to\nTalk about what they look like what the realms were like what they did anyway so I just encourage you to do that but here's the story this is true it it was before nine teen Ninety six I used to live in Rochester\nBut I was living in California I drove across the country many times and went to visit some friends in Rochester ah I'll Try and find out the exact date but right now I can I'm going to send you an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a a man or woman and a boy and a couple of other people walking one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around out seemed like to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and the one woman\nWho I was very suspicious of that just appeared\nSaid Hi to the other one and she had a girl and they said of can our kids play and the the the people that I had been walking with the mother said yeah and we sat down at a picnic table and the strange woman said to the other lady that I had been walking was what's your name\nThey they tell their name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks into boys gone and she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and I swear to God I Am not making this up\nThere was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bump them but this is the part I Want you to know it had\nKind of futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature looked humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped at least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought that that creature and those people that appeared were part of the same group I thought they were military people and this creature was a genetic hybrid this is what I Believe\n\nWell that that's quite a story a David any reaction to that no one interesting\nYou know you do have some uh basketball thank you for calling with that and the the

random corporation and we found out that one of our executives was accused of this on a regular basis not not once not twice not five ...\nA dozen different women came forward and said that this guy was doing something like this I don't know if I Would feel bad about it I don't know if the fact that he resigned I don't know if I Would feel torn up about the fact that somebody finally got caught\nOut here you might problem like let's use our boss for example Robin and suddenly all the guys around the building say that she's been prop positioning them that's not the person that I Know

Washington Glen welcome to the program a lot of weird stuff happen up in that area\nI have heard of a red rock lake area dark\nI have not but uh please tell me about what's what is your experience been\nBack in time I had friends that we have hair and a ... very in my friend's wife was going off into the thing is my friend said like red high looking at him\nAnd he had a whole white back for like the wrong way raptor and there was like ... noises stuff here of like a greyhound\nOf walking on both parts later on a couple of weeks later or being dragged out of there and it never was never ever said about it every year you know anything about that or\nWith these strange smiles like almost too happy and anyway it was it was odd [noise]\nUm to this day the one thing I Wish I had done\nIs make note of a make and model of the ATV and asked them how did you get past the road block how did you get that ATV back onto this road\nThe two girls there's no way they could have lifted any weight and even to adult men that looked like lumberjacks again they look just like the people on the brown and paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up on like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes\nI Can't remember this is a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting\nAreas in the rain forest in the woods [noise] um they were like blonde hair blue eyes again just like of aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans\nIt was like they were too perfect not a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the plowed shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere so\nThey just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\n[laughter] they kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped in I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake\nAnd like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life sometimes don't sink in until after the fact and you know I started thinking about it well wait a minute\nHow did they even get that ATV onto the road that show [laughter] alone how weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I Do you up in those woods there's been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that the records their their sounds\nIt was in those ... woods where I heard this show or ungodly showdown that couldn't be any other animal and I don't think the best opera singer ... she

I've experienced since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveils a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found this true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great have you back\n[noise] hey George how that anyone even wants to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nWhen you say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today\nThat you make some personal observations than I Am not a I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books I insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because the similarities or some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put that in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people will see that you know have these people are really really good people these are the drags society these are the upper echelon and it it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it's it\nSeems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you've mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one are you missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your book help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say within the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh\nI don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that's evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can and there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been ground to help and ah\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and it's frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration in their voice a\nLot of common one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stops searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote the search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement reports see who they interviewed who they talked to were they searched the effectiveness of the search or the areas that they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching blind\nAnd there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI I find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was ... then ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service\nGovernment entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nWe're talking with David ... about his latest work missing for one one land air water

of you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never [laughter] and there's the serious a YouTube sites\nThat have been named David flight is missing for one one missing a national parks are all frauds they're knocked me there are people that have used my name to get innocent and listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is a kennel missing project you to say all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click in and you listen if you don't know it's somebody you're talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust you to really don't even listen to them a lesson that cannot missing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right um talked for a moment about search and rescue parameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use euro went on I mean there are metrics there are\nIn this one as well yeah there were multiple multiple times\nIt's just so weird um you know a lot of these cases you have to come to conclusion that somebody just snatched her ... snatched the victim just\nThey go somewhere else or they're not no longer on the spot where they disappeared from their taken um the the ones that really get to me are the ones involving kids and I there have been so many of these cases in in all of your books about little kids who wander off\nAnd are found impossible distances away sometimes they're alive amazingly enough but I'm often found impossible distances away and there is no way no way they could walk there on their own or talk about that phenomenon\n[noise] so there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talk about these cases and a couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important [noise]\nSave you got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child found say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with a case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOr four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps ah another two year old in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old fashioned Fifteen miles away twenty four hours not possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals it says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point laughing at these numbers absolutely blow that to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is and all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance\nAnd extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you can set your child down in the dirt on a trail\nWalk away watch the child with a child going to do for the next hour they said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit\nGet upset cry and then go to sleep and I said how many how many parents and you think your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare but I have all these examples where these heights have been achieved by these little kids\nWere they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nA yeah he's got a movie we talked about a two year old boy that they just he traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges\nAnd he was some face down and snow the next morning unbelievably alive and we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened and if his mom said we couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe it was the wife\nYou know the case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours he'd have to go point six miles per hour\nA buddy kid's not going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody picked him up or some something or someone picked him up and blocked him there\nAs well and and the reason these cases have significant is that let's say you report on a child who's a duck to downtown Vegas\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know sure as probable somebody put them in the car and drove from there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party didn't see anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody else saw anything nobody saw any cars\nNobody else was there so how did that child make that distance in that time doesn't make sense\nOr in the new book or it's law L. A. W. land air and water and a land cases you've talked about before but you've got some new ones including one that happened in organ pipe cactus national monument Arizona\nRent to take a break now when

part of the national Park Service for their property and they patrol it their national park police are there\nWell there's an art location called Oregon or Ga an organ pipe cactus national monument and it's an Arizona far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico\nWell on February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico [noise]\nDrove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around and she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called her [noise]\nWell I stumbled on to this case and sought some archive somewhere\nAnd I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff asked them pretty documents on that case I got the documents in my hand that I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports and they said we don't have any I said have you heard of the case no\nWell the person still missing [noise]\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a key teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and studied under and all the articles and all the reports said that they stay that she was really smart [noise]\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in theology and biology and she was working in a ... a university lab tech to earn some extra money [noise]\nShe loves the outdoors hike regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence southeast Albuquerque [noise] she was driving her white sixty eight point a station wagon\nAnd she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she wept in her car that first night February first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation\nAt the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions in what smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture and asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson said he ... he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOr February third she moved her car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February for it nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found carols car park in F. this Kenyan picnic site with a note taped inside the windshield\nThat said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February ... please contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nExactly that Russia everybody would do that [noise]\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving the snow I wasn't sure [noise]\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle\nThe two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second he notified park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service that you sent in to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described in reports is cold and blustery they determined care was last seen eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs month an air force base\nThey brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search every three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent

documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils\nAnd it was three type written pages that outlines a search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane for radio what it says one additional was turned up on Monday February fifteenth too limited locations about four hundred yards the park on the south west facing of the host AJ or less\nA very strong in distinct human odor was found but didn't know what their locations\nSupervising ranger how cross of ... that's where our national monuments and one other searchers who was recently involved in the recovery of body had very strong and positive feelings on the day then vacation at the odor\nThe following day ranger cos after flying the area and a border patrol plane letting eat man search party back over this area again the odor was observed at the same location but only occasionally and not as distinct\nOther members of the team described it as a very weird and scary\nAll efforts were negative and search activities have been reduced intermittent patrols at this time I have never and thousands of reports seen anything described in a national park service report as very weird and scary\nWhite guys that yeah\nIt's really strange is just dealing day had or the fact that they're smelling what they think is decaying human flesh but there is no source or the older\nWell here's what's this other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary so\nI'm sure all of us who spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying some time animals die smell it I don't know if that could be rewritten scary\nBut ah again\nThis was her second

named Henry McCain and this is really pretty creepy\n[noise] that is a creepy case and ah [noise] the new Brighton Minnesota the community just north of Minneapolis not very far off the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old [noise]\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called Mountain View again just north of Minneapolis north side this cost her area of missing people that I've written about in the past\nYou had a great job he was an auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue [noise]\nWell and there were six two thousand and his wife with kids or went to California and it was a planned vacation well\nOn that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend it was a very diligent guy on time very respectable and he and his friend went to the early\nYeah the people who don't know\nThere's a series of triangles around the world and in the book I talk about the Alaska triangle Bermuda Triangle Great Lakes in Michigan in Nevada and the way I got onto this was there are some people out there in the world that are much smarter than me that I've read these books and\nPut together some very interesting factual side note\nAnd a guy from uh Finland did some amazing work sent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances and your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that\nAnd then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles now and then to\nTo try and go down there by you it goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle\nAnd when I first got on to that I thought well this seems kinda hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a map I said holy crap you know it's in the middle that triangle national park yes I go that's\nQuite a coincidence so you're Seventy kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances and king canyon and sequoia as well [noise]\nAnd when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle there's several thousand planes that have crashed and disappeared in this year is in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents things which seems reasonable\nBut when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh do you have any specifics from the Nevada Triangle you wanted to get into where should we just go you jump into the cases of air disappearances in general\nAnd it was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the book from Moffett Field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that's a\nI grew up not far from off the field and sunny vale I grew up Cupertino and I had plane flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week\nAnd it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps that patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed in there and Treasure Island in the middle of the day\nOn August sixteenth Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting a sent out of Treasure Island where they held the world's fair was man by the Senate earners Cody twenty seven years old and an infant Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol\nAll the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this well\nAs they depart\nThey start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the feral on islands in Cody was at the controls of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military and it was owned by Goodyear\nAnd they took it because it was a need for control\nWhat both men live near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to a treasure island for the day to leave on their ship\nOr that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal third person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nThe first hundred and ten minutes of the flight was normal fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles east of the feral on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scramble to over to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the blimp\nWill the planes encountered cloudy weather with a ceiling a five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them\nAt ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they had to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why it was there\nAnd then it'll eleven Fifteen for fun and calls Moffett Field again stating that in LA had crashed in the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast\nOr the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb missing the\nGone to was in near perfect condition both motors on the ship were off even though one frog was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were life preserver over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tanks\nThe radio was in perfect condition no distress call\nFor fun thing called back and say they said they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call\nThe central coast of California had a major search that started almost immediately the navy found to fishing boats and navy vote in a postcard ship that saw the blimp dip and dropped to ... on the oil slick\nThe blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowds they said all appeared fairly normal but it did go into the crowds and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to build the street and Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean the\nCrew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the craft were still there\nThan there was a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there's a couple of theories that developed a ... theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break and come back we're in the jumped into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing who people\nEnded a break with journey wheel in the sky\nCheese mind them ... and I get loans you ...\nThe fact that somebody finally got a huge problem like let's use our boss for example Robin and suddenly all the guys around the buildings saying that she's been proposition ing them that's not the person that I Know there's no way she would ever do that\nYou know is do I think that it's each it's our boss let somebody like that we would have been able to sniff that out I don't believe the people that are like oh my lord I just I don't mean to put it in a news organization

Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast of California and uh the blimp\nIt's back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\nSo the navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board when it hit the beach originally when it hit land it drop one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood\nThere was a massive search off the coast that went on for days\nAnd they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch the flick that they were watching on the water there were lots of water craft in that area\nThey never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd this is an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] your point raised national park which has had several strange disappeared says I've documented\nAnd just south of the Golden Gate to a location called half moon bay in that area because I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no or they're part of the northern California coast north of that coin raise area\nAnd nothing immediately south half moon bay so it's this one area that has just strangeness attached to it\nAnd like you said that they came up with some explanation for to me that were laughable\n\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened\n... ... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left or the craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\nOr even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak\nRight because the the area of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get into that if I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works uh in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick ... case which is a famous ...\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was the organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened in the winter basin\nAnd the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I've thought the same thing in multiple missing poor woman books that looks like people are snatched down of the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these are odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin walk Iran's that uh a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch and elsewhere\nAnd I'm Jeremy ... made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and\nUm and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside he had a had an ongoing interest in getting Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch\nAnd I asked a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone or he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the public has never seen so\nYou know he he has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things and that sort so\nI don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with the larger picture but the idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wakeup call [noise] I think so um [noise]\nSo you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to a different currents that could take my teeth into they can relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study\nBut ethics seated before sometimes I think\nI Am related to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers are ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it and I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water\nAnd when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it just filled with water I have no cases from there\nIt's bizarre\nAnd even George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow\nUm it's manmade lake but the ones right in the middle of the ... reservation they use a control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at that lake is a a ... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and the objects coming in and out of the ...\nThey're in there but a lot of drowning said that uh the the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people at Brown there and ah\nSo ... you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch who meets your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things that's or but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that that the person who told me that in D.C had brought them your books and and your subject matter I Want to try to get one more of\nAnd that's one of the reasons I've been wanting to say anything that\nYou know maybe a possibility 'cause it may cause that were already I mean I thinking where we are today versus where it was six years ago ...\nWe're talking with Dave ... missing for one more land air water in a
