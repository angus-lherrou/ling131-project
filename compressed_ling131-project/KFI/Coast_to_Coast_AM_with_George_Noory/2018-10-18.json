somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is or\nWhat happens more often than you would think George is\nWhere does the lending money come from Alan Paulos before these loans\nFor the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized lending program [noise]\nAh so the federal tax payer puts the money out [noise]\nUh and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education [noise] uh and it sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that essentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter]\nAh but um so yeah this was a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who at this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit [noise]\nUh and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans\nAre exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fair debt collection practice\nLaws federal um a fruit in lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam\n[noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cup ball of bankers are which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits\nYes served on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when the company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise to a holy private for profit enterprise and\nShe can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nAh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds these people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhere do you recommend for a parent who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices trees in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow\nGo to a private bank get any private line of credit [noise] uh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices just so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding has cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University has now Seventy thousand dollars a year\nWell I can guarantee ... per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college and by the way it no longer tapes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the cat per seat vacant\nBecause there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices\nBut also really string students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently we're\nLosing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um have to charge a huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond is shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and in many others are about how the student loan problem is really affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off\nNinety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses Skilling entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be felt\nAll right now we're going to check in with you with phone calls with them in college when we come back\nIf you've

[noise]\n\nWelcome back to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans game what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three ... and engineering and um I graduated and found myself unemployed\nUnderemployed for a short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera uh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a system that actually wants you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is\nWhat happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and [laughter]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Lesley Stahl yeah a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed\nI might add a and so it's sort of snowball from there I\nUnfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick in by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory a ... year mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst I see are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them\nWith just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car and so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed\nAnd they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and if you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership you're like hey guys you know the car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you\nYou should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks\nYou know uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say\nFor lower income people um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night an expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education's just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shots and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about\nI mean let's be honest about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people who you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and how cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the Lenny system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs crazy crazy what's what's the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse earliest probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way\nUm but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four years I\nI should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really haven't increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy so this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid [laughter] fine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge good thank you\nGot good news for you too man a Trump rally over there and a lot of the other day yeah there was a big fines they support sealed and he left right after the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I wanted to drive a little bit of traits will do\nA anyway there used to work or I got on wildly when a company went under the under the company I'm a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad but a pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people so I think I owe here and I don't want but they wouldn't even\nHello this is where I was I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too well and I said well here's you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nAnd I looked at the local school there and they were to forty four thousand dollars for oh I think it was a two wars just don't take well you know the way\nSo I ended up going now unless there's not a thousand dollars on a grade school are learning to drive semi trucks and then I felt like I got shafted on that I found out that it's not a surprise sounded\nA let's get your reaction to the cell and where do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place school\nBoard in sorry to hear the\nGordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Alan he's the one pointed out to me that the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I our already knew\nThat the more you subsidize the lungs especially the taxpayer on the hook on an aircraft a dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college did\nLittle thing that sent to the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exchanged the amount that you were originally borrowed\nThe federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae in many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit I'm inspiration they get it all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're going to come back and take final culture with you in just a moment here on coast to coast am [noise]\nGoes to insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available

tonight we're going to be talking about aliens at the Pentagon and Nick welcome back it's always great to have you\nGreat to be back on the shirt I don't know how you doing these days yeah where do we last\nSee each other contacted the desert we were there ...\nAnd I'm now was that good for our to your life event in Foley city which we did\nThat was right around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you great job in deed aliens at the\nPentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's a essentially it is a new documentary that I put out to tell the story all lead to\nYour program\nBut to your life that story and and really to try in one human trait to tell as fast as I can tell the story of the U.S government don't want any relationship with the\nPhenomenon watch seven decades now\n[noise] lots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest thing go wherever they are the UFO community I think that the only story that I think comes\nTwice and I would say this wouldn't if the classification and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off to decades have to know and the U.S government did have a new effort right Graham off to roll and it was run by secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I feel that the other day and you're like you say Oh yes they said no no sense particularly close down we haven't been doing this in traffic or no investigations and of course\nThey and that's what I really focused on in in the film alien for the Pentagon to try\nTo train angle the numerous threat to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk\nOf mistreatment both the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of the big yellow Senator Harry Reid told the long and you couldn't make this stuff up you\nKnow you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff neck it 'cause it's coming from all different directions these days\nThink the on that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story in once and for you\nPeople is that the problem is that they can do without them we have two little information about what's going on with the eight story with with the [noise]\nRevelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about a case for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just a confusing mess if you if you think back to when the New York times when they are they a landmark story on\nThis on December sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out will to first than a\nThan a third one but now with the public have been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this walk stock guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman and and struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's\nThat's what I Try to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this\nFrom my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film will get a lot in the course tonight then they're gone but tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on this one and it was quite a a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and then you've done this of course civilian time yourself you know you said in the hot seat a direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I've got edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd\nPut that back then and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon and what I did is I teamed up with Warren coils from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script this thing so I ... the entire movie I did the I wrote a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nA script for this and ... in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio you know you had to move and headphones on and I knew right did the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a director who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Michael long I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can while I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I Want to do because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure from me and it's a completely\nNew role to me I mean there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy ... just made a ... a great movie but um you know I I was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish the\nFirst lady I as I say really to try to talk through some of the the confusion about what's\nBeen going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field\nHas is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and ... and ... you know it is difficult to engage with them so by putting this out as video on demand\nWe go ahead on to the platforms that the young people\nNeed to watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google playing food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but to young people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since toned along had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stories of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen they have story I I did ... or you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do nowadays like like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you

defense and and it's by the um law in in the snow in a ... year program to finally from\nFrankly reasonable moved to say yeah we we should have a space for us but I think some of some of the country about this has been a little far fetched I mean it'd be something from assigned fi movie by apple aliens I mean it's it's more about Goldman Eighteenth future of space\nWell are you exactly but what do you think about the late president Ronald Reagan's attempt to give the star wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of a alien or intervention\nYes and he certainly made of course those remarks\nVery famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally thing how quickly would we would set aside differences down here on uh if if we face some alien threat and and of course people read\nAn awful lot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read read a lot into that to\nMy own personal view is that that was much more about just trying to ... when the Cold War and find crop the Soviet Union which to be fair is exactly the way it pretty much played out\nThat's right absolutely there's been there's still talk of disclosure are you you know I I'm arguing Steven bass and all the time Nick I don't think there's going to be the kind of disclosure he expects\nDo you think that the things that are happening now our governmental ways of trying to soften us up for governmental disclosure or do you think it's never going to happen as I\nYeah I I agree with you I don't think that kind of Steve Basset um disclosure with a B B my fellow Americans people the world we are not alone I don't think that\nIn in here they are bringing them yeah yeah\nUm and and we've discussed this before one of the big problems of course this is not saying that there extraterrestrial thought if it turns out that we've known about this for Seventeen years they can be awful lot of questions to answer about that no I I think it's more like clay\nAnd I don't believe either this is a kind of softening up in a climate ... program but I Do think that through\nThrough the revelations about eight tip and three of the classification and release of the British Government you file your files we are seeing government say effectively will look here is\nOur data or as much of it as we can release you know without compromising\nSetting classified information I'm ... and and the ultimate irony of all this might be ... genuinely gum and don't really know what they're dealing with either and which takes me back to the mountain we\nQuote what if we all dealing with something above and beyond comprehension that it would be an allergist to explaining quantum mechanics which you say\nYou never know you you you never know when you look at Leonardo da Vinci's works or he depicted things that we have today I'm not sure he knew what the what what he was drawing though what do you say\nWell he was clearly a visionary genius and have been a time travel\n[laughter] well I'm not sure about that but um I guess there are there are a handful of physicists\nWorking on that Ronald Merrill it comes to mind yep but I think there are some some others or you know I had a job in the ministry of defense where I was paid to think the unsinkable so I I don't really things out\nDid you get involved in remote viewing or anything like that psychic work more that has the ministry you did\nYes absolutely we had you can't run a UFO program without finding yourself\nThe the focal point for anything\nYou saw that any any one kind of comes to to government about and of course we had we had people who said that they will psychics and they wanted to volunteer their services to the intelligence community to help us well\nYou know locate Soviet ballistic missile submarines are on mosques pies and trade has that sort of thing\nSo we looked at this as a classic low probability high impact scenario probably when what but if it does the payoff is so big wine on\nSo we actually did have a program the U.S government of course had three over the years that we know about ... some street can Stargate the ministry of defense go into this briefly in about two thousand and one\nAnd do the study which which was classified I think the ... only it's now classified and only ministry defense website actually or on the national archives website I'm not sure where but it's out there it it wasn't a very good study\nI have to say it um didn't learn the lessons of of the U. S.\nPrograms and and because it was an intelligence program the age old problem they they work so much in silos but they didn't go out and talk to the people that they probably should have talked to I some of the people involved in Stargate and real frame and ...\nWhat do you what do you think of rumors about a congressional hearing on your phones well the Dutch teeth\nYes it hats and actually this this is a big breaking news story literally just this week it it turns out it's more than rumors 'em all you know from\nReliable sources that the Senate Armed services um Services Committee has already started looking at the two thousand four new may incident which of course was the focus of of some of these\nThese the classified videos that we've been talking about they've interviewed at least to the pilot and I think one of the radar arthritis\nSo so we have the Senate Armed Services Committee involved we also in parallel have the house armed services committee involved and if you look at the congressional record\nFor the house armed services committee dated April ... you will see a paragraph tucked away and I think it's run through about forty three forty four pages but All right there on the second page paragraph for three I\nWon it says that the CIA plot supply the committee with a briefing on basically what I did\nNick when we come back we'll talk more about these

I say we know the Senate Armed Services Committee and the house\nArmed services committee have been looking for the ... ... have been doing and secondly I think that interest has said wait until the white a question of you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative Amy Farrah I think it was a has had some discussions with the chair of the uh science technology and space committee\nAnd the space subcommittee that could actually be a little bit of a don't fight about that I mean that's another\nPoint if this congressional interest which we know Israel\nEvolve into formal congressional hearings the question arises well where should those hearings the as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the space sub committee or the the science technology and space\nMain committee I think I think it will be difficult to get it away from the middle of tree frankly hit with a a military and intelligence program and I just can't see how you would get it out of of the armed Services Committee and indeed\nOne of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks in its terms of reference\nAbout unconventional threats well if ever there was like a forum to to discuss the UAE pay a mystery it's it's loud so so you you know I I think it's we know as an absolute indisputable fact\nThat there is congressional in traffic we know that there is lobbying going on for formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I've I've played some briefing myself and I sit and they said that I'd be I'm happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um bought but watch this space one of the other things\nWhich I think it's it's bizarre and fascinating is I think so far they haven't really been for\nA national daily newspaper reports that have actually gone into the fight but yes there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know what all four of those articles or in British newspapers\n... one us so no not yet no no\nThank God we do what we do and we have so many good podcaster is out there doing what they do to get the word out next\nI absolutely but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunately he got the ... one one of the things is I Know do some work is a freelance journalist myself a it it's kind of like like we said with a million ... and again\nYou know if you don't like the way that you you are portrayed on TV sometimes when you're writing documentary well I I take the same view with newspaper articles and this this week I had an article published in the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily nearing\nAgreed on line or two\n... yeah I absolutely as they all have to be these days and and my well let me go in the guardian basically um I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee in the house armed services\nCommittee interest and I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it's it's it's staggering but have before articles I've seen about this or for British not wanting us\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line or I'd love to see a survey of a twenty five to thirty year olds in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety eight percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean I'm of course all of the age where I like a hard copy newspaper

I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter]\nThere are also fair to collections actress laws federal um a fruit in lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam\n[noise] well the genesis of this genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cup ball of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes served\nOn the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nAh like many of the state run guaranteed horse in the country um like USA Funds these people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living in a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhere do you recommend for appearance who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices trees in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow\nGo to a private bank get a private line of credit [noise] uh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know George ... of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices just so astonishingly much that you know no amount of ground serves even state funding has cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now\nSeventy thousand dollars a year biking guaranteed ... per year that's tuition room board books um for a four year course for a four year college and\nBy the way it no longer tapes for years to graduate George the average time\nTo graduate from undergrad is now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the cat per seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to polish much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raised their prices\nBut also really stream the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt\nI there was a story just recently we're losing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental or in the bills are so high\n[laughter] that's right you know and and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um they have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond a gp Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem is really affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety billion dollars in interest clicking off\nThat's Ninety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses Skilling entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be felt\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with Alan Collins when we come back\nIf you've got a student loan give us a call if you've got a question give us a call if you're an instructor at a university and you want to give us your feedback on that give us a call as

troubles way tougher\n[noise]\nCan buy a um ... more stimulating Tong [noise]\n\nWelcome back to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was that Alan that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three ... and engineering and um\nI graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time [noise]\nUh and I tried everything I could keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera uh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there was too long as is falling into\nA is a lineage system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is\nWhat happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and [noise]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Lesley Stahl yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add [laughter] uh and so it's sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy is an outline that people who have a rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick\nAnd by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory or the other gear mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations in one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them\nWith just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I have no student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it on line and say you know look it's had a great reviews you go and if you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no break any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should er at the manual because this car comes with no breaks\nYou know uh and in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say\nFor lower income people um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans and the first place so the only people the people that get student loans\nAnd it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the Lenny system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs crazy crazy what's what's the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars\nYou're [noise] and there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three for\nYou or I should have pushed my kids' sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories where people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars ... crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just to providing\nHe'll go to Joe truck driving in Indiana and again this started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen good thank you\nGeorge I got good news for a two man a Trump rally over there and a lot of the other day yeah there was a big signs they support the seal day there he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of trades will do\nA ... a company I used to work or I got trained on equality and when a company went under the under the concept of a private life rational mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know that it was a sad time but uh we pretty much went on during the late everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people do so I was in her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let me think loews or if I was I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too well and I think ... years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nAnd I looked at the local school there and they were to forty four thousand dollars for oh I think it was a two wars just don't take well you know the way\nSo I ended up going now unless there's not a thousand dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi trucks and then I felt like I got shafted on that I found out that it's not a surprise that even\nA let's get your reaction to the cell and what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Alan he's the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I our already knew that the more you subsidize the lungs especially the taxpayer on her arm and hand crafted dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college did\nOkay I already knew the bill Bennett hypothesis but now there's one thing that I wanted to mention and that is the ... I'm a conservative everyone knows\nSo the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan show\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I be our program and

my bachelors ... well what ... what\nThese companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the lists or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Eleanor these scammers\nAre yes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them in this\nSounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall they can assure through this loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that or or they're just trying to get you to read your your your loans and so we consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger alone or and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nGeorge it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrade our pose a telltale ha that job thank you and I hope we hear more of it before Halloween point don't I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a loan and all or a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nI Hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular or what their information has a hundred percent correct the principal was\nSixty four hundred and some change there's you know there was a breakdown of all of the ah a call that I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the oh he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Alan what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted blowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy right back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education [laughter]\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the lake it alone he'll take it fall dude you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a close up and you're like like what you describe it and they\nGet the information Allen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public jak clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt\nNever heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are strong beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead [laughter] and\nMy niece is down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having such limitations these things can fall you literally to the grave [noise]\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically for order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original sign\nPromise [laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it off next aliens in the Pentagon

and\nYour grandma [laughter]\nBut you're right that story and and really to\nTry in one human tree fell as best as I can tell the story of the U.S government relationship with the phenomenon watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nDied during the town that they have been the biggest single wherever they are the UFO community I I think that the story that I think comes\nAnd I would say this is the classification release the British Government but the the revelation that off to decades have to know the U.S government did have a new effort right Graham often when it was run by a secretive defense intelligence\nAgency and they feel that the day and you're like hey if they had no sense\nIf we close down we haven't been doing this this knowing trashed there are no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try\nTo train on triangle the numerous threats to this story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment polls there all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this but Robert Bigelow a Senator Harry Reid taught in the long I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make honey you track all this stuff 'cause it's coming from all different directions\nI think the answer that one is is very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely and meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story in one sense for years\nPeople have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's going on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about a case for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mess if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on December sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to first than a\nThan a third one but now with the public has been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well there's the videos and then there's this rock stone guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman\nAnd and struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I Try to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this from my incite a perspective of\nHaving run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot in July of course tonight's dinner gone but tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on the salon and it was quite a a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and and you've done this of course civilian time yourself you know you said in the ... said a direct tech kind of talks to you and you spend a couple of hours and\nAnd also the question is this when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I've got edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put that back then and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon and what I did is I teamed up with Warren coils from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would ... this thing so script to the entire movie that the I wrote a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and ... in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a a recording studio ... you know you had to move and headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a director who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and ... than\nWhen we look at the final poll dog no one can while I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I Want to do because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure\nFrom me and they took completely new role to me I mean there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy ... just made a\nA a great movie but um you know I I was a departure for me so took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish the\nFirst lady I as I say really to try to talk through some of the the confusion about what's been going on just how the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field\nHas is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and ... and ... you know it is difficult to engage with them so by putting this out as video on demand\nWe go ahead on to the platforms that the young people\nNeed to watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take their subjects not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but to young people and and another thing is\nYou know it's been a year since ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen they have story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite the ice and put it by where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do we know nowadays like like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat well when when you say the organization I'm E. E. T. I. P. O.\nRight yes um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has said well he always says in these sorts of\nSituations I eat as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know where the eight tech is still an ongoing project I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course\nSay yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and\nStill has has a lot of contacts and friends that\nHe he says it's still going\nNow other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nSeries the winters both will play in the world series the developers of an earthquake early warning system are looking for more partners to use the technology shake alert coordinator Doug given says the sensor network on the west coast is built out enough to be effective now\nUnfortunately the technology that's built into your phone to send you notifications was not designed with earthquake really worrying and mind\n\nYou should schools factories in water systems can use the alerts events wanting can be from ten seconds to about a minute or my board up the just as you just told me I should bucks I meant brewers\nWhatever they're going to lose a former president of USA Gymnastics has been arrested in connection with the Larry Nassar case Steve Penny has been indicted by a grand jury in Texas He allegedly tampered with evidence against Nasser former team doctor who's now in prison for sexually assaulting hundreds of girls and young women under the guise\nOf medical treatment and Canada's become the first G. seven country in the largest country in the world to federally legalize marijuana for recreational use\nCanada's attorney general Jody Wilson raybould says the goal is to make pot safer reduce organized crime and keep it away from miners strict\nProhibitions does not work under the previous approach it was easier for a teenager to gain access to a joint and a bottle of beer well as we said criminals reefs huge profits\nPlans to pardon pot possession convictions involving hashed passes a stash is up to the new legal limit of thirty grams there are also new tougher laws for DUI\n[noise] traffic from the ... valley that's\nOn the sixty west just before at a Wanda Iraqi involving two big rigs is stuck in the right lane so that's ... from country village savannah gave us a call Ralph's anytime traffic lines ... five hundred five thousand three about the problem in mid city that's on the ten east at national\nStalled car stuck in the right wing of the overland off ramps watch out if you're headed that way and Lin wood on the one oh five east at the seven ten there's a wreck that's now ... over the ride shoulder siege pie is on scene and they're trying to clean up some debris that's less than ...\nYou can't find the sky helps get you there faster I'm Shana my parents are\nSupposed to clear out their lives close to sixty clear today and it's going to be hot again mid seventies at the beaches mid eighties mid nineties inland little hotter friday or Saturday and Saturday believe it or not by a couple of degrees then some relief back down starting Sunday we lead ... from the KFI twenty four hour news room I'm Michael ...
