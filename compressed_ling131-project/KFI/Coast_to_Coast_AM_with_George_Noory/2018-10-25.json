that you're not going to keep paying somebody after they died\nRight they can also pay I dismissed me with no additional compensation for material this honesty\n... he's I Hope to get that a hundred [laughter] than they I think I I I think we've already violated that tonight\nYeah well it looks like we're you know pushing paper back and forth but um it looks a were closing in on on a an extension of a of a deal that would that would have me here for another three weeks\nOh great great ... everybody a it's a comedy show through Thanksgiving all the ... well not quite the Thanksgiving the Wednesday before they get\nCarried away with a I think it was the friday before Thanksgiving I I was in a newsroom when there were ...\n... the friday before Thanksgiving now you know what I Know that by the company I used to work for\nThey cut people a week before Christmas oh why how one they they they cut twenty two people one week before Christmas I don't know how you know because they had to get them off the payroll for the new year yeah but I don't know how you bring somebody in your office and say you know this Christmas trees there's Santa's there's\nYour presents under the tree company tree and everything yeah maybe you have your Christmas sweater on you're looking at a a calendar um what are the what are the are the calendars the countdown to oh no\nThe uh the advent advent dad been countered your advent\nCalendars already you know a week open you know there's the four or five\nThe six doors that have already been open and you got to sit somebody down and say you know what um we we we really love to have a new here for fourteen years but we got to make some changes around here I don't you know what it's really unfair to to uh to the person that has to do that oh yeah\nYeah I I think I think you would have to bring in somebody that nobody knows or a law George Clooney in that that that one movie where that's all he was was just he would fly in fire a bunch of people fly to the next city by fire a bunch of people because how\nAnd that's every ... yeah how does that person whose whose job it is to let everybody you know twenty two people know on the on the day you know a week before Christmas\nThat they're fired how can that person walk around\nRight how does that person enjoy their holiday right\nYou know I Know that they do it All right a lot of people were that\nStore by the way my favorite part of that story the friday before Thanksgiving was a it was a field a reporter who had to drive his new car in\nFor a meeting oh my God what was happening so why is personal stuff is in this new cars that he's ... he's been driving round for ten or Fifteen year old bubble so one of the guys\nHad to drive him whole\nOr he was fired\n... that's the worst right so in LA ... radio it's always a different way to get fired nobody's ever fired the say no ... why this is a lot of people have been a texting us or or on Facebook and Instagram whatever social media saying do we have\nThe promo that we used for the Chilean miners oh yeah and I just found it oh this is a problem that that I heart media used in their national event\nBecause they thought it was a pretty good pretty funny I don't know maybe a what they want it but this is I I don't know if a tested you remember that the the miners that got caught in Chile\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing is to try to make Republicans look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know things ... he's created an environment so somebody would be induced to do this you don't\nKnow that you know you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict\nFrom our authorities in intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about it in the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one and others throats\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level America is best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate\nFormer presidents and leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that weigh in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this air that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to an end hopefully that's a wake up call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast [laughter] but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you've been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing\nLooking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nNote on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others\nHe was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre ... one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer\nYou cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their ... keeps their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nAnd law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals in institutions in in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWhether somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd\nBe somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight\nShut up wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nThey sure did in ... in when they landed\nWhite pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this happen continue and less stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stopping realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans are owned by ...\nWe will talk this week and see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon as described the killing of ... is a heinous crime in his first comments in some of his closest aides were implicated in the Saudi journalist death\nSpeaking edited

let's check in with our expert Lauren Weinstein on the Internet boy this would be amazing ...\nBefore I comment on that I like to make a technical comment on the fence today um I I Would I Would estimate the probability of this thing track down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time of being very very high\nUm for a career I mean these are all unexploded devices\nThat me and all kinds of trace evidence is available from them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the U.S some of them were sent through the regular mail for us here\nAnd then I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities\nThey probably have that all figured out already the entire ah UFP of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the sorting got\nPictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office camera\nAt the post office or ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days or certainly at a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this some of these questions are are going to start to be possible\nAnd she'll say dad got about a minute left or optic story really like\nI I mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it's more involving a ... communications rather than individual I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet is are we going to be able to afford it\nOr the ISPs going to raise the bad with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole allocation for the month in in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put the high speed a new advanced system in the uh high rent urban areas they haven't showed a lot of interest and putting them into rural areas so there's that question to are we ever going to actually see it depending on where you live\nOr die from Lauren thank you so much will be in touch with you this week as

can be someone\nJust like a mischievous spirit [laughter]\nIt's probably not like a demon it's probably just as maybe someone who lived there before and they passed on but they haven't really passed\nOn isn't possible with her so that you cannot get rid of certain spirit that are just lingers for ever\nWell it depends I think all spirits you can get rid of 'em because you can appease them

we need you on this program my friend look I heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring I have a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagement and these January November and December\nCapital even two months about going anywhere I guess my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you how are we love your standard I got to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter\nIn Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named stamped and Friedman I\nSaw a little clip being in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group or at Oakland unity\nThe city and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be overtime for this\nYou want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my Sony tape recorder out I went to interview Stanton Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known them ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis

out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\nWell I think there's been a much wider acceptance I I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there you said there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or were they going to be sending a signal\nWell the latest word began it looks like there's about one point six climates per star a galaxy per star\nAnd our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion star so that means one hundred and sixty

Conley was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got he but but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president or that's the way I like to run again I think he was in the front\nAt so the so a governor calmly and his wife were in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they weren't another so it would have been a another ... of sitting there and and the\nDriver or a or the other Secret Service agent who was on the passenger side so you would have had six people in that\nCar would have been six strange route and Tom is looking at it and what do you ... you can you turn Tom's Mike up for just one second Denny to put your speaker downtime and tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up does uprooted film\nAnd I'm watching them come over and what are you just described Kennedy back with his wife right\nAnd a woman you can hear me 'cause I'm I'm looking at the film are now I hear you [noise] and uh and then a ... I don't see a third row of seats I I didn't I don't remember seeing the third row either Bill thanks Don\n... thing and and again\nI'm that's what I always thought that it was too Secret Service agents at the front seat and then a second row with Governor currently and his wife and his wife was to his lap and the president at Jackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nThe teacher and I mean I definitely do the secret service agent was in the front driving because everybody accused him of now turning around shooting the president uh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut no I ... you know again I think about this and I I studied that as well because William Cooper is one that was saying that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have had to have been less than that if that's the case and also [noise]\nJeeze driving so that means he'd have to take his eyes off the road to turn and then make the perfect shot you know with his left pan\nAnd everybody wants to see that\nYeah so I you know I go by that one\nEvery with Bill thanks for uh being behind the secret door you've\nGiven us a whole lot to think about when the new book comes up get back on the program for a full show up next one more gas behind the secret doors\nTo find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to go to ... am dot com\n\n[noise]\n\n\nHome insurance policies outdated and when something breaks and your policy doesn't cover it sixty four percent of American households are under insured without dated coverage and this was when\nAt age six six eight four four Seventy three forty four\nThat's eight six six eight four four Seventy three forty four\n[noise]\nWhy am six forty more stimulating talk [noise]\n\nOkay walking back to coast to coast our final secret doors here let's open it\nGrows on you know a lot more right come on in just telling you\nThat\nI [laughter] I'm fine how are you\nOh I tell you about my day I had one half of a strange\nThing you know how to phone then brings out the crazy when I can tell you all Mad Men against CAT scan it you know like goes Halloween scare that go\nAh you're you're pretty good I'm going to guess\n...\nDay when you're learning not at all I mean we know that they may be part of my brother well he was born the actor\nI don't so you're not lose McCants\nLet me know I'd rather not reinstate color let me tell you and you know like that and again the radical whatever they want to it's like being around us you know you're you just can't yeah we're in a way that\nThese issues here in ...\nOh busted Jew [laughter]\n... George Parker Parker I'm thinking of the ... board with Parker Brothers you're right did I Know that's got to where you have your bed Karen\nI have been doing great Georgia how about you and I'm great on the other we just didn't act like\nEverything's good enough for people who need to know who you are Karen ... is the weed you board person is that fair to say\nThat there to say yeah we we did what little tools I like to use and as you know I'm now director of the talking board Historical Society ... so we diversify and all things talking boards fair or their ... board\nMarla ... a more moral Martinson believes the you're the greatest we'd you board personnel to her\nWell she's very ... let's say it that way she's very ...\nKnow Caren dome and maybe one of the only people we know who loves the ... board folks as you know I'm opposed to it on and want to use it when Karen feels very secure with it I guess one could say Karen it has to do with who the user right\nYou don't have to do with the use your your intention that has to do with the reason why are you the number one and also\nWith white people forget it has to do with your own perceptions belief in what you think about and how you view yourself within the world I mean if you have a lot of fears that you're going to drop to you but when you're you have common sense about yourself and uses tool for the place of love\nFor the place of light from a place of wanting to explore to discover then the whole the whole atmosphere around the world changes\nSome people believe that the ... opens up a portal to allow these evil spirits and ... to ... to come through what's your thoughts on that\n[noise] you sure and and this goes back to what you believe or your perceptions of the world and so I don't believe in it that they're earning power that they're just the pond to their world\nAnd when my work really is about beyond the board it really is about teaching people to find their empowerment their core strength then and that is found by remembering recalling who they are the divine bean and that they are an extension of sorts incarnate when you come from a place of that\nKind of ... and beyond that kind of belief system those kinds of intentions then you get what you desire you get you get a whole different\nWay of communicating communion with the unseen dimensions I mean the work that I Do with this tool is no different at somebody who channels\nOr works with a K to meet her at paranormal investigations or read stroke cars are using ... to name a few it's really similar principle you have your attention that\nYou use it only as a tool you have there's no hidden there it's viewed or power inside of these chunk of wood or cardboard or glass or whatever they're made out of\nIts within yourself the board is strictly a permission to allow yourself to access your own internal abilities to work in Israel\nHave you ever had a bad ... no I haven't had\nBad the worst I've ever had with somebody cussing at me once in a more and this was many years ago this back in Nineteen eighty\nThrough through the board they were crossing the border\nBut let me tell you this George I people write to me and asked this question all the time you don't continue to engage\nIf somebody in life if I'm if I'm like standing in line you know maybe get a check out the grocery store and somebody gets really rude I'm going to not engage with that person I'm going to move away walk away or not engaged because they don't you just make it worse and so the same thing with this tool you don't engage and all I did was say you can't talk to me that way I'm bored\nHe might have board on our dog had\nGoing good and going and that's it and it works that way now works that way because of my own beliefs about where the energy these efforts are coming from they're coming from me if I Believe everything's negative and I'm fearful of everything\nBack from a draw to me I mean there are lower energy is out there and once I realized I had the empowerment with me that I could really a strengthen myself internally then everything changed from Nineteen eighty six on it than just wonderful beautiful experiences\nWho's moving

really basically means your mind as controlling the movement and so the subtle movements of your muscles are the power suggestion is making the plants shut move okay that's one possibility\nAnother one is is that it's some kind of animal magnetism our memories them that's occurring through your body and these are some old thoughts that go way back to the Eighteen hundreds\nThat's one thought about it to a third one is a is that you were actually connecting with some energy outside of yourself and it's working with you for that plants at the moving spell out messages\nThat's Beijing worked when that happens ... ...\nThe amazing and I will say this uh the group of beans I've been working with and I've talked to him before I talked about um before on your show that look like with this group since Nineteen Ninety four I call them the guides they've explained it to me that's what they say\nWhen you come to the plant chat you set your intentions and whether you with a partner or by

investigators say all the packages were similar manila envelopes lined up with the bubble wrap for six stamps on the outside and the return address of democratic lawmakers Deborah Wasserman Schultz in Florida the package\nMail to CNN was addressed the former CIA director John Brennan\nHe says he recognizes there is plenty of raw emotion and very strong feelings for individual political parties but the country was founded on freedom of speech\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing this to try to make Republicans look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know things ... he's created an environment so somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that now you don't know that\nWe need to wait and get the official verdict\nFrom our authorities in intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level America is best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate\nFormer presidents and leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that weigh in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this there that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to an end hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you're giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you've been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and as we got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd those on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre ... one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep this keeps their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone\nBut I Am convinced and law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals and institutions in in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWhat somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again because I Know you've got people\nRight saying this could be a false flag maybe somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media thing that President Trump still this weight shut out wait let the intelligence officials doing their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined done\nThen we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one country we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the way empires our staffers and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in\nFront of they sure did in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize

heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring a I have a much wider scheduled for the first time in on the teen years I have no engagements and the ... of January November and December I Can't believe it two months of out going anywhere\nAre against my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you we\nLove your stand that I'm going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter in Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named Stanton Friedman I saw a little clip being in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group\nOr an uncle in university and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this you want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my Sony tape recorder\nOut I went to interview stance and Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis he who is the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you an alien fest the end of January up near the big beer and I think\nSo at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo he's a stand telling me telling me what's going on in the field of view ... these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\nWell I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or they could be sending a signal\nWell the latest word against it looks like they're about one point six climates per star\nAthlete galaxy star and our galaxy the Milky Way has ... billion stars all\nThat means one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the place and you know that change is our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization ... around and we're at the top of the heap well roll over the place\nAnd that changed our perception of how important we are of course from the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and leave plenty of room in other words for others and we've come to realize that you know gotten here from there is\nNot quite the big deal we used to think it was a hell of a virus comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that uh you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth\nNow we're ... we're fusion for example\nOr you can get ... hours we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a special bus or a part of the world was greater than four thousand B. C. that's right it can be who may beings around you know well he was off a little bit four billion be\nJust a little a little\nUh our ... natural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things [laughter]\nThe ultimate you know hopefully [laughter]\nUm we're beginning to realize the busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place whether this is a result them\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere on migration colonization of people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying that a mirror throw in some of that they put in incarcerated people you\nKnow like yeah like a ... boy guys and brought them or\nAre you never know the way they've been treating people it's it's it's really\nStand to you or one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide yet but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and\nAs a matter of river expanded the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that what we think there's one point search for ... for stars so I guess like a huge number of planet [laughter] you know they're probably come in here\nBut I I'd have been left that there's only a few thousand pilots you know if there were a life out there and we see it mhm you know they would make contact them a lot of White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so now I think it's more like realizing that at North America has more than a\nFew people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place and we that makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOr or still flat [laughter]\nAnd and so uh what most of us have learned that it's more complex place for them we fought it was him we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we've known now we measured the age of climate the stars and things like that\nAnd uh hey we're not number all all no no and so ... we\nYou can tell from another thing or the military budget on wind it's about a trillion dollars this year or so we haven't changed much have\nWe know that it'll make\nPeople don't get the goodies of are on their work uh we take for leaving for because we're stocking up on and on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature but it appears to be close to what it is\nI'm not going to try to explain why or how what are we know enough to say that ah\nThere's an awful lot of energy to the hill to men universe [laughter] you know gone to the sequence of I Know huh how long does it take to get some boys how far is the nearest person on almost kind of stuff in\nThe universe crowded [laughter] you know it takes a while I got here and there you don't get on your bicycle and go to the next door [laughter]\nAnd the more gosh you know in the seventies and sixties that's all we heard\nUs right now we I think we take it for granted that there are aliens or maybe we are here I haven't talked to any leader\nOr maybe they ...\nYeah maybe they got all lately a raccoon enough is enough and that might not be surprising I I have a great deal of fake ... gets pushed a little ...\nAnd ...
