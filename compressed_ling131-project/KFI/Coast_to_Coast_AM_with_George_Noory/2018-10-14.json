San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do the experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences that's\nWhy it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative energy it's you were going to create it\nWhen your mind is going to mold the reality around you if you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that as well\nWell we are creative\nPower for being ... and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into it incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but the it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I don't remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got in the recycling took off your helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that um\nRide their owns a motorcycle and it was and it woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a projection of anything and it was when I was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension which\nLooks pretty bleak pianist and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because\nWe scared to each other yeah I'd I don't know if that an added well out of body travel most likely mhm\nWell it could have been but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus is what I call consensus realities and there's non consensus reality there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that\nAll agree on a reality and they create I Try called consensus\nThere's many types of reality that exist in in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to start to learn these what is essentially the rules of non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear time right in the gravity we're used to their yeah when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity\nAll the things we're used to have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy state\nThat's and that's of course one of the

Stephanie waters is my guest welcome Stephanie\nLisa I'm Glad to be here and I love that proceeding commercial about paying because\nMy gold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan [laughter] I'm going to scare the pie that's lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial saying can you really shape the original is is that this is Jerry anyway [laughter] don't go to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true cause\nSo well you send me your book and we do are you constantly in Colorado during our guys shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's very unassuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what is your first experience with her normal\nWell this I didn't think go since I was me an e high to a grasshopper is what I always say\nI'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago\nIt was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and unite the paranormal can even immunity and also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend or a fence\nAnd she said professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirit out of Longmont, Colorado\nMhm and so the two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from the other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and leave we\nIt a little faith because every year we try to bomb threat in a different community and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go on and the night supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I got particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles sport and I'm sure all your listeners\nHim that he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them to see if it was possible that these things really happened\nAnd so that's what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to shift for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book\nGoes legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through shut the ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to diverge cancer and how do you how you reconnected your life would go what were you doing before then\nWell before that I like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nSwimming seeing it you you know I see it and I actually feel it\nI'm just like humans to make samples that\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things [noise]\nUm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProject that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack\nAnd I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was so I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nIn managing Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head haunted wine and cheese parties\nYou know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I knew was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California is a time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually had come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast and I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband and mind you and she died\nAnd so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I feel bad a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address and he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything that we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts style I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter]\nExtremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house in five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house with what ...\nWell after us and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated\nAnd I'm an artist you know and it's very severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going right oh yeah I actually\nCalled the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest as fate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like that while I hired twenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge state so Nineteen Ninety\nNine and it was ethic my goodness\nYou do during the loud blew everything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till\nThe ghost of surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me

tell us a little bit more about you when we were just talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there where else in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called to you\nYeah um\nI think another reason why I'm that\nPeople were drawn to manage his springs ... reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pack Twain than that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nDay which is October seventh I went up there to the theater and the ghost is gone it worked\nSo the manager confirmed that snow yes all of this worked up beautifully [laughter] than eating\nNow had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was\nAmazing during the time before book\nYes oh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand six team\nBecause the theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball\nAnd this was reaching out that's currently trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their story\nThat yes you seem to be the you'd like to publish this for the east coast and the [laughter]\nYou I think that has made it is\nIt'd be one you have a wave really connecting history with these you do the research it's like a real live go go under\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you'll always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's hard to buy the goals that likes the little girl that bounces all isn't she do I'm like no leave in ... but listen friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited no no that's not if they are they're just kicking you being of tricks and\nHere they are present here by their own their own their own mind that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during nighttime so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the ... and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely get picked believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know there we do have the votes that come out at night you know but um or at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time to actually look for those of you wants\nTo see them with your eye is at the in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nIs a transition time why it's\nThe ... if the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter it lends itself to the shadows does that make sense\nYes it does it make strapped when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast\nRight now and then I call it the God like it only lasts about ten minutes and then the Rockies we had a beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks and the lead in the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you're living in now hunted or did you ... non\n... lead the gas or the goes follow you right they\nDo on like two words it's very funny the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten\n[laughter] just kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and managed to her on a timer because whenever I Would walk underneath ... life they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know the certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said yeah that's true [laughter]\nSo they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights flash this this town is very hunted by a\nWell it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah I did that happen to you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping of life\nI used to happen it doesn't get any longer\nAnd the uh did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you know I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause they'll think you're psychotic they're like oh well\nHave you tried to say it's happening at well so\nThey're like oh aren't you

little bit before the break about\nI teach now there's many places in the world that have lots of lead to lure but this particular one because\nA lot it's considered one of the\nMore usual places in the world as well as um because of its kind of rich waters and mineral rich area in that particular region of the u._s. can you tell us a little bit about your experience as many ... you know to be\nWell I'm pikes peak I think it was called T. T. V. a TiVo or have a I think that's what the native youths used to call it but they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe\nI just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nWhine whine and we're not going to call them\nConnected to the mother okay yeah it's connected to the mother and think about the native is the way that they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get um father sky Mother Earth ... and so\nThe significance and even even if you look at the mountain it\nDefinitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThere and the natives knew that if there is of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold rush\nA produced more goals than any place in the whole world I Hope I have that right but I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well yeah\nAnd if you ... I Love the show ancient aliens and they talk about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camps\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers to fly over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHere and cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw us so when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon it was clear day life\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships\nAnd they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards with by the time it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hollering they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating 'cause even today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brushed it off as being an airplane but this was before we had\nOr a government experiment gone exactly\nExactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the beast it mhm theoretically sack played up and down sideways covering you know like a helicopter mhm a fascinating and they didn't know what to they there was no explanation now so what I did was I followed it\nI followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not there weren't a lot of people around yeah\nBut a lot of people thought this I mean just outrageously crazy\nAnd he found his story in\nKansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing\nAnd the story was consistent\nVery much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's\nThere was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the world Wide Web could possibly know when farmers in Colorado where thing that I mean this was amazing back then you know [noise] um well we you know that we had the telegraph\nOf them do you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals search a conduit for a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as the director of the paranormal conventions\nAnd one of my friends is named Dan Mathias and he lives in green mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak and um he saw a big foot or come to his back door opened his door actually um [noise] he um the big put\nActually rubbed at the high neon his screen door and he actually had some big hair [laughter]\nAnd um then has really committed his entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal and he does live above green mountain falls back in these rock formations and there's Patrick clips and the rocks and I've been back there with him and so all of this myself\nAnd I believe it's possible you know well why not\nWhat have you seen in the writing\nOr he leaves my friend he pulled it if it's um you know it's like stick figures I find this fascinating because they are elongated just a straight line is that you know with too little like a triangle at the bottom and then a triangle on the top\nAnd then these long arms with triangles on the bottom of it it's very geometric looking it's it's fascinating and my friend actually believe that his property is a poor hole\nWhere big foot is traveling intergalactic ... and I know it might sound outrageous but why not consider the possibility that\nMay be big foot is a missing length maybe\nAnd maybe ... maybe he's coming in and out or maybe we're seeing\nI'm seeing something that happened at another time a long time ago I don't know [laughter]\nWell tell me ... how do you feel that the Native Americans feel about just a few stories and go and the legends and so forth that isn't being reported on by Native American\nWell this is great that you brought up this question again to you'd think like a researcher because that's what I mean I'm like well why don't we have more stories and that's because nobody was looking under the right name of course the Native Americans wouldn't have called this preacher big foot now would say\n[laughter] I wouldn't have gone tiny for no\nThere there was a hundred and fifty four different names by the Native American Indians depending on\nWhere they lived in the Rockies where they were located a hundred and fifty four different names that's why we had a communication problem here I mean I can think of a few names right off the hand that I mean that's why I'm doing research on this was so fascinating it open so many doors for me I went oh my gosh now this story makes sense now this story makes sense\nYou know all of a thing being once we decide on a name you know sasquatch I think most big foot tall it just like to call it um you know that is just a name that it's been come up within the last few years I mean relatively speaking maybe fifty years I don't know\nI yeah I I'm but I my question more it's more about the hotter the Native Americans feel and the people feel about these places that are being built on the men issue springs area and garden of the guards in the areas near pikes peak\nWell that is really very interesting and the other good question because the the the legend is that our town is constantly flooded baptized by water every seven years and so it seems to be true\nNow I looked into this and I'm like going All right well when's the last time that we've actually had somebody tried to remove the curse and it was back in two thousand and what happened was in Nineteen Ninety\nCause any ghost experiences or question if you

Institute in Virginia and William sounds as they set aside he meant there is any guide you\nDo these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that things just from my experience in love to hear more\nCivilian welcome to the show\nThanks for joining William\nHi how are you feeling good side he'll\nTell me first of all what led you to even create such as this tendency I hang out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own ah I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer and then there should be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was methods to self initiate and out of body experience so\nExplored them and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily exercise um I initiated my first holy conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your\nFamily who had actually the your entire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality has shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience was self induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise uh that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help or negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your OB e where did you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side not our when I become aware I've realized that was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall and when I\nDid you think we reached the army now\nOh no I was nonsensical I I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nYou encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this and my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment with a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about what I had first stepped into here\nAnd ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that's around if you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the sort of consciousness\nAnd trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional what I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA Dharma is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yeah yes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know incredible as our our world is and you know incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all of the tens information the human being why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there is trillions of all their life forms yeah and not all human\nAnd it has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and you know their meal because especially they heal meal you aren't you blame them because they're usually not a language to really clearly defined what an entertainment chin is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're human or why they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to act passed\nAnd it all communication is very elegant it's by thought and there's no need in other words\nLanguage is no longer a barrier we we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here\nThat are symbols and it's uh it's amazing but\nThat's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere is no um when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say\nTo go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow you're Disney you teach at them in really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called it an afro tourism [laughter] it really is an adventure and he's a beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the Monroe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great in Virginia I'm\nOnly twenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm\nGenerally what I mean each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah these acronyms and um\nWhat is that controlled holistic environmental chamber in other words each person's in personal isolation both\nI speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber and then I present\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact ah during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way I imagine you're having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you on that I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're shifting those um people that died and this is this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its functions and different names and different cultures\nBut nothing was ever went to ... we we presented in I think I'm more or let's just say a very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can ... that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented\nIn a very logical way that's understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allow the person to have their own experience but then all of that\nI went to find out a little bit more about one of the culture or does this and what it calls in other cultures we're going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what other countries just exist and

research at the mineral Institute\nSurveyed over sixteen thousand participants who have gone through the OB e training at than than real Institute in Virginia and he's come up with a common reported phenomenon associated with these obese Cleveland was wondering if you could explain some of this to our audience [noise]\n[noise] yes I'm just to clarify I've been that the Monroe Institute for the last eight years oh okay\nBut I've been studying nursing practice you know for forty or to just to go on my website ... dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a\nA number of surveys and I receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and\nThis is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were happening or so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance um [noise] a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds\nAs a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nOf Seventy two percent at some point experienced some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are foot ...\nThirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through close dial it if you're seeing through your clothes die lives at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical\nBody\nBecause you're having it doesn't mean you've accident your body but it means you're in the process but most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at\nA for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body right is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nAnd then that's the dance on because that happened if I'm a retired I Will switch and I think his muscles ... are you saying that now that he said\nNo I'm I'm saying it's not I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have found and what many other um experiences have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take for granted no one you know there is no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a slate and you can observe this actually during and out of body experience\nSo what does it look ... image you're looking at\nIt's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream can or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences are is natural his breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're non physical ... temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just\nIt's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay\nAnd most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how did you bring down and imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay and you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back in the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way\nA lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get\nInformation given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just a download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOh what's going on and I think\nThis is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated or verified ... anyone other than you are\nRight and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nThat's very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines\nAnd [noise] you know I always ask somebody that's an avid believer and anything like that a specialty of religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this big and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you

William you may\nCause sure and has to let's go to Jamie in Washington state first time caller here and coast to coast and Jamie what is your question oh oh the gun or a [noise] what is your question my friend\nUm though he says there's been a relative in between the out of body experiences and a memory loss\nGood question the question I mean not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\n... ... a bit of both uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experiences so\nI was scared to death are are are truly was and but right there at the end it was like a a breath of fresh air came on me and I wasn't worried about anything anymore\nMm that sounds peaceful peaceful and is is what it was\nExactly peaceful\nHave you been able to recreate that experience I'm not a heart attack that feeling that experience as peace\n[noise]\nNo I Wish I Would actually be great\nWell maybe that's maybe you can blame could he\nAbsolutely one of the things that people do report when they have and out of body experience um is that they have this immense feeling of a love and peace and flooded that just flows through them mhm\nUh I've talked about this many times um it's like you're entering into a some people reported\nLike their entry into a sea of of love and um and acceptance and it's and it's like it's difficult to even ... there was no words to even describe some of these things\nBecause they're beyond their or I'm a verb itch but yes I mean that's one of the reasons that people do a explore these experiences so they can uh much if they connect with those higher aspects of themselves\n...\nNow and thank you very much for your phone call I appreciate it I mean has there ever been reporting of events and not a good experience similar to be is that you can't love right\nLike there has been an end to ease and nightmares in lower absolutely\nYour fear based if you've been brought up with this concept that there's a double\nA or a Satan around every corner waiting for you to counseling you you're going to have like you made like we have a negative experience your own fear will create it when we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space\nAnd that's what people forget and I I I say that it's all the time you know we're not observers\nOf non physical reality we're participants each thought is a creative projection and we are influencing the energy is around us we do it in the physical but slowed down here but when you leave your body through near death experiences\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do she experience ... if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs\nAnd to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative energy if you were going to create it when your mind is going to mold the reality around you if you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and\nA negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that is well\nWell you are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into it incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I don't remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got in the recycling took on their helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that um\n... owns a motorcycle and it was as it woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a projection of anything and it was when I was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak the honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because I wasn't scared each other yeah\nI'd I don't know of that and that it locked out of body travel less likely\nMhm well it could have banned but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there was non consensus realities there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist in in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to look at them learn these what is essentially the rules of non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear time right is to gravity we're used to air you know when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity\nAll the things we're used to have to ... you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm In my workshops but it's also in my books but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence\nYes so that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they well thank you so much Williams has been great if you go to his website which is an astral info dot org you'll find out

different pieces of history little pockets of his\nAnd the owners to me you can find things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience where we\nAre normal well this this ... I've\nBeen seeing go since I was the an e high to a grasshopper is what I always say\nI'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago\nIt was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and the unite the paranormal ... community and to also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend dory spins\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits out of Longmont, Colorado\nMhm and so the two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and uh we've\nWe call it ... feast because every year we try to sponsor it in a different community and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in goes or things that go up and the nights supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I woke up particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nBut he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them to see if it was possible that these things really happened\nAnd so that's what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to ship for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book\nGoes legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through shut the ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to diverge cancer and how do you how you reconnected your life which goes what were you doing before then\nWell before that\nI like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nSwimming seeing it you you\n... I see it and I actually feel it\nOn ... like he was like\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things [noise]\nUm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't protect that into the future but\nWhat I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes\nI saw where it was that and we went back in there it was so I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while\nAnd about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast and managed to Springs Colorado and he was taunted and so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tours\nAnd I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head haunted wine and cheese parties\nYou know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I knew was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love the story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight is a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California is a time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got\nLaid off when the company changed hands so my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast and I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband and mind you and your she died\nAnd so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address and he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts style I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown\n[laughter] extremely\nRun down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house in five years\nAfter five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house with what have you well after us and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated\nAnd an artist you know and it's very iffy that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going row yeah so I actually called\nThe owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this is before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest is state so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything\nLike wow I hired twenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was\nEpic my goodness you do bring full out literally everything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this was going right [laughter] I Can't wait [laughter] well\nGhost of surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that
