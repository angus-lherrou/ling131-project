his uh focus again\nOr the popularity of those books has overshadowed his original project the one that got him on the path of pursuing missing persons cases\nTen years ago next month they made his first appearance on this program with me to talk about the ... project\nA groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery and which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies you learned as a police officer\nTo the sasquatch legend immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the talents of a forensic sketch artist to give accurate portrayals of what people have been seeing for very long time\nWell it may have been focusing on missing for one one for the last few years but never lost interest in big foot so areas with a new work gets an archive of big foot and wild man stories and news reports dating all the way back to the year's sixteen eighty\nAnd well I think David is probably not likely to take a position on what the answer to the mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing collection of reports from eyewitnesses newspapers journalists hunters and others who've seen these creatures up close and\nPersonal ... welcome back\nHey George thanks again for having me a\nAbsolutely no good\nTimes on the show and I appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big what does it feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stop working on it I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it\nIn the last say seven eight years and focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about um something that looked like big foot when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and\nI hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented in and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes they're the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not lifting ten years ago when your first year we kept the project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how what kind of got its hooks into you know all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and to the guys I was working with it were super wealthy\nTo me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains at the ...\nAnd they found each other later in business and in a weird sort of set a coincidence they started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar encounter and they said you know Dave we you have Twenty years as a police officer or you have years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace me know your your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down in the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the ... police that a police background I approached them and they said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nI'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that there would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders\nImportant conversations at home but I mostly focused and the next

[noise]\n\nWell come back we're talking with David polite us about big foot Wildman and giants the newest book an archive of articles that go way back to sixteen eighty a describing these creatures people whenever you want to call them\nAnd before the break David Was explaining how he and some colleagues had collected a whole bunch of samples dozens and dozens of samples that were submitted to\nVery a very precise DNA kind of testing the paper that was written by Dr Melba catch them maybe had some personal um ... observations that didn't belong in the paper but the\nThe DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\n[noise] well that's the part that I don't think a lot of people understand it wasn't some half ale treatment it was it was the best of the best that DNA was sent to for certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake\nAll of the labs got the same results or was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you could see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that dealt with did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nBut if you go into their area and you kill one of them they'll kill three of you and then they go on to explain that they have certain abilities that you don't understand\nThat you could think that you're around and maybe a coyote or bird is right near you when in reality it's going to be them and they have this incredible ability to mimic anything that they want\nWith incredible strength and size\nAnd when they said that there another tribe of people\nThis community in the big for world that is very adamant that they're an ape throws this completely off the wall\nAnd when you dig deeper in it most Native American tribes of fact probably Ninety nine percent say it's another type of people will try and this article goes right to that point and nobody was ever written a book before tribal ever brought that out\nAnd when I when I found it I couldn't believe that nobody was talking about it and it it's studying still that nobody wants to talk about it\n\nYeah I Wonder what those tribes if they're still around would say about it now\nYears later nine years\nWhile I can I can tell you that being around tribes in the mid west and in the west like Harvey and I were it's consistent they still say that it's a type of people\n\nKnow the descriptions of course as you have noted that the term big ...\nThe Nineteen fifty eight so before then people had other words for it and it and then many or most of the early clippings and stories that you have collected they call them wild man of course I guess that would fit I mean they they're humanoid shape they're out in the forest there Harry\nUm they don't know what else to call them\nFor walks like a man walked upright and doesn't walk bent over and their knuckles aren't dragging on the ground like an eight um\nIf I I always tell people I said well if it's an animal then it's probably going to be found and it's probably going to be identified and you could probably go view and study\nAnd wild man ... that's a different sort of thing it's a different kind of topic the very elusive a ... I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot studied year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it's never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no familiarity with the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred's so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat [laughter] I traveled with you I Know and I think people are scratching\nBring in some rationality to an irrational observation [noise] um and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nBut said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what maybe some explores wrote about that they hurt in which he encountered so\nBut again in tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where and explore from the ... church was coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explore notes that\nThis thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked him I die and actually spoke to him\nLarge hairy by pac he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with ... church butter de saint church and it's in there so to say that these things happen happen we take it with\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques valet you wrote about it and I have a clip from September Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black cloud like mass\nLanded in a field releasing a huge here covered being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive um big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a shock to book on a about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a fellow over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of it\nAnd uh his book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this topic it was a stunner I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and uh it's a tremendous book and people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking with Dave ... about his latest work big foot Wildman and giants

I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not a ... will be tall but covered with hair and they were just sign of playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nI think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake\nPlaying like kids in the water um it's again the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encountered what they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book off to look for a of a big but that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's\nConclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the\nMyth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and some people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em cramped up\nSo when you hear these stories are these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and say half the time they say it it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get them um just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there are never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody is writing about it than fat\nSeems to be a there are instances where and in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as you know I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say\nThere's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and it ... I I never heard of a hunter say\nOh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on a ship or they've got him in jail and ... invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nAnd then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out the core of the property up their so called dogs\n[laughter] but I think when you get the trust somebody to dairy farmers way out in the middle they're going to tell you the same thing because I've heard many time\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what a what they eat and they'll you know they're at a particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and\nDifferent kinds of fruit um do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer or they're an omnivore\nAnd many times when the natives are in the middle of the woods hurting themselves\nThey'll come across it you're stuck on a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pounds here a native ... could have done it they don't know how it goes way up in the tree and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did he get their\n... big foot wild bend a giants is the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your on coast to coast am\nWe\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\nCasts and when they break [noise]\nI'm Michael throws your live from the KFI twenty four hour news from fire officials say for people and been ... been hurt in a\nMassive house fire bitter fire officials say cruised down to separate homes in planes early this morning the fire was so intense people in Oxnard ten miles away so they could reportedly see smoke and flames to people in the fire were taken to the hospital in critical condition a third home caught fire from the radiant heat six people in Florida being treated for injuries after shots were\nFired near the Jacksonville Jaguars GI a bank field\nCorresponding officers found five people shot at the scene were transporting the local hospitals fire rescue paramedics the victim was transported to a hospital and\nIn Jacksonville sheriff's opposite directed a run that lend vase if someone started shooting from the passenger side of the car he says it happened to this afternoon on the sidewalk outside of a laundromat all victims of five men and a woman ranged in age from twenty to Seventy\nIt's unclear deputies are searching for more than one person and then in India is allegedly been stoned to death by monkeys\nThe alleged stoning happened last week in a village near ... the man's family say he was collecting pieces of wood when a bunch of monkeys do brick swimming nearby broken down buildings on the tree top they say he was hit on the head and the chest and later died at a hospital\nAt least have a different story saying the man was a sleeve near a pile of ... when the monkeys jumped on the brake causing them to collapse in Egypt a man\nNamed family wants to monkeys registered in a first information report police have found a written complaint against the monkeys but identifying it as an accident receivers Eric ...

exporting more stimulating talk [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history there to authors are Sarah ... and the claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program a I Am blown away by your book grey tabby here\n\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen or most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nOr actually with a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the core and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb in stock\nAnd add to know more about it so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library imagine that and you know they're looking to what was available at the library I still find any\nSo I I Hope someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I you know I thought out what I could but thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it\nAnd you know flash forward graduated from college and said well no one told the story and you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to meet them the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes they asked me to be their story teller and that's kind of the cliff notes version of it\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be um an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project from either way I got involved was I had actually been praying I'm I Do play about my work\nAnd I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an iconic for over two stories\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmaker named Sarah ...\nWell what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis was that I'm In being Indianapolis a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay\nAnd she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she pitched it to a major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we've seen since than the brothers\nBut we only base\nMini series on foot so you're going to be ready for a while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff though for your family and friends she reached out and and make contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I'm a navy veteran she didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my joke is is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or into letting you help her but uh eventually over the course of\nSeveral months we finally met and then uh we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we did it I guess the projects that that's the and a half years\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is

out there in exposed to the elements for days they they have no water and after ...\nDays they're just going crazy and then you know you have to deal with the sharks that's the that's the terror that most of his Nobel because of the movie\nAnd apparently that is not exaggerated the ... not by much anyway oh Sarah maybe you want to talk about that part of the story\nYeah not at all I mean you know the the shark population in the Pacific at the time was much more concentrated and\nFrom the reports from the survivors you know there were hundreds of sharks are circling them at any given time and you know they would there would be frenzied attacks and I think you know and and I both heard\nYeah tend to stories of just men and you know having their buddy right next to them taken you know and they they didn't know who the sharks were going to attack there was not a real rhyme or reason to it and so they were always in fear\nAnd one of those harrowing stories was where you know there were\nAbout Fifteen men on a ... and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked\nThere was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers accounts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really in ... they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts and the attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors\nDid they were so they could walk on their back you know for shark shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they could not stand on them\nThere's one account you have a sailor who you sort of go it becoming delirious and he's looking down things drugs thinking oh there's food I'll just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm ... and by the name of John ... than he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was going to wait list hoses bait to learn the sharks than and catch one and then if you know he kind of came to its senses it the last minute and realize oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put it sucked back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter] so some of the worst effects Lynn are ... happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah everyone knows it's almost the end of the war and they're having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines the\nUm and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors are just plain pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's there I mentioned there were only a\nSixteen rap between there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups that for rap\nOr three great the Fort wrapped in any case\nThere were four group the Fort raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so that there were so any water that was available with only available on the raft\nAnd so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were than men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how they're the they got that there were others who although they knew that the sun and the measure and the gay hydration itself with perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and then you see one sailor holding out the torn piece of his shirt\nOr while the other one poured the water through it into the into his mouth and thinking that that would bring the salt out well of course that didn't and then others when you know take no for it is that the water\nI'm hoping that no one would see them and talk and out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called ... and\nSplit that full bird blood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess in immediately that it did sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who winds up testifying at the court marshal waiter\nOr an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ...

generals up in the cockpit within minutes late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see that you know kind of explosion coming from below and there is no reports coming in saying that there's any kind of enemy action though he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah I get the same kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually tried to report it a couple of times\nAnd you know the army side of things said well let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still at two and a half a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this genuine look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in the area don't worry about it and so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know the gentleman ritual of France's have passed away but his son carries on his story and you know there he\nActually had diary entries of the time and that's when he saw this and it did line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when we're ... released about it that he would\nTalk about ... about Indianapolis the true

is that no distress signal got off the ship\nSo they were saying that that was happening they thought that was the ship fall for getting hit by torpedoes and having her power you know flown out\nI'm

focus again on the popularity of those books has overshadowed his original project the one that got him on the path of pursuing missing persons cases\nTen years ago next month they made his first

police officer\nTo the sasquatch legend immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the challenge of a forensic sketch artist to get accurate portrayals of

mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing collection of reports from eyewitnesses newspapers journalists hunters and others who've seen these creatures up close and personal ... welcome back\nHey George thanks again for having me I'm\nAbsolutely no good\nTimes on the show and I appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big but does it feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know what I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last say seven eight years and focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading\nAbout all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like ... when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd has been documented in and it shows this historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not lifting ten years ago\nWhen your first year can you be kept the project how you got started on that what you learned and how it kind of got its hooks into you know all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and to the guys I was working with the super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they tell the story that independently\nWithout knowing each other when they were kids they had a big fund encounter in the mountains of the ...\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar encounter and they said you know if we you have Twenty years of police officer ... years investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace you know your your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Moscow to California\nAnd according down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approach them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of

I don't know anybody that claimed to have studied them in a while walking into the wilderness and found a spot studied them year after year so they\nHave intelligence it's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods and even the animals on the ape gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bone found ever but we have Howard while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that really makes you think\nYou know some of the descriptions in the articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it\nMust have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat coupled with you on a and I think people are scratching\nTo bring in some rationality to an irrational observation um and and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter it's a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and the description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seems possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what maybe some explores wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\nBut again in tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an ex or from the Watergate church was coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explore notes that this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and look them I die and actually spoke\nTo him large hairy bike he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or ... and it came from the archives with the latter day

I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited and it looked in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed up playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally non hostile shy want to get away from people when they encountered but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big what that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's\nConclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought the big for was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth\nKeep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em cramped up\nSo when you hear these stories are these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it it never happened it's a completely phony story so I get\nEmails I I can imagine what your emails or light but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big what the kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge Wildman carrying all women and children\nYou know there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as you know I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I've never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nOr

to authors are Sarah ... and the claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis he became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program a I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nHere or\nThere I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen or most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nOr actually with a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of the ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb in stock and\nAdd to know more about it so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter] imagine that\nAnd you know they're looking to what was available at the library I still well he couldn't find anything so I Hope someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and\nYou know I thought out what I could I thought you know someone will tell this story before I'm old enough to do it\nYou fast forward graduated from college and then well no one told the story you know the right way so I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to me of the men who survived the Annapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid with a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey said it all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family though and they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visit them at their homes they asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the clip notes version of it [noise]\nAnd land for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and great misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be um an amazing draw for you\nWell it was very hot and the way I got involved when I had actually been praying I'm I I didn't pay that might work\nAnd I had didn't have an opportunity to work on an iconic over story\nAnd all of it than a thousand a Latin additive I get this email from this young some African they're invited well what they're saying that her journey with\nAn apple is with that I'm an African storyteller she wanted to render the story as Franklin and she actually did that she wrote a part in it too and major production and they have the ... and a brother\nThat we only the event\nSo you're going to need to write a book like well shoot I'm a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff though for your family and friends she reached out and and make contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I'm a navy veteran she didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's life this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my joke is is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or in the lead and help her but uh eventually over the course of\nSeveral months we finally met and then uh we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we did it I guess the project tickets and a half years\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the the story had been wrong that a lot of the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely part of what I wanted to tell but\nReally I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaigns that he participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more ethical you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sent [noise]\nBut I'll tell you grab me ... my father was a at ... he drove a landing craft from those ships took us troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that they you know was was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes the you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flagship and I'm\nA small part that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of us in our where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was sitting in the shore of environment and during that time in March thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men work till twenty six injured and that was what really sent her on the faithful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater I'm Victoria that open now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nTell me this was a difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I I Know there's been so many wrong stories in wrong conclusions made about what happened there that I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nI think a big part of it they mention is that I spent several years visiting with that spending time with their families talking with them that you know\nWith no other interests other than learning their story and so they I think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and putting the story down on film or you know\nThe screenplay and eventually the book and limited well when she came in we had this trust built in with the men that they knew genuinely wanted to tell the\nAccurate story however hard however long that would take we would tell the true story\nWell he was a it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters are you you get to know these people a lot of the people who are characters of the book obviously didn't survives you're basing them together I guess from people who did know them but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nTry one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back and land on an apple a story has really been a part of the crash and not as if to\nCircle back and the men who very atomic bomb aboard the Annapolis was an army Robert an army major name Robert for men\nAnd spent the last couple of years of war renting down all of the material that they feared the Germans were you try to develop their own atomic bomb uh\nOn the continent of Europe so one that can be and then burn and very simple component the little boy and an island\nUm that is final ratings getter at Europe and and the conflict and so in writing the book we tried to pull back that rather than bringing in a lot of other characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the point of view in addition to hash amount overhead and for your call and tell me how how does it\nMatter and what we tried to do or where you have to recognize it even matter of the men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing what\nI'll tell you what ...
