{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "Company very prestigious and I'll say go uh in Churchill's ill fated assault on a on the uh the Turkish state to kick turkey out of the war the British are going to try to fight up the deliberately peninsula\nAnd a and get to a ... problem is the British landed and then they didn't do anything\nSo by August of Ninety Fifteen um things are just horrible uh it's difficult to resupply the thousands of men are under constant shell fire but the Turks are dug in uh probably some some of the first deep deep trenches and World War a one\nA and the living conditions are horrible medical care's horrible so a assault is called for and the British a fifth Norfolk regiments can be part of it the Australia New Zealand a New Zealand cetera so it's August twelfth and its high noon\nOr ... there's not even a full moon for waiting at night they just decided to go at high noon\nA and there's a perfunctory artillery barrage and everyone goes over the top thousands of men go over the top charging straightforward at Johnny Turk\nUh the problem for the uh the ... the uh the e company of the Norfolk is that their objective is a mile and a half away they have to walk ban\nThat's fixed or not run but occasionally run but they are a assaulting through broken terrain and some there are some woods but they have to make an object of a mile and a half away\nSo the Turks are having a field day sitting there just picking them up with machine guns one by one dropping artillery on them because the human being a in August in Turkey wearing wool can only run so fast right\nWell uh as likely or as unlikely as it as it seemed the sand during hams this one company all employees of king Edward the seven they got ahead\nThey actually got far far out front of the rest of the British led offensive are so far out in front that they got to their objective they actually got on their objectives\nAre and began fighting the Turks hand to hand with bayonet or with rifle a et cetera and then\nThey disappear they were never heard from again they're going they're absolutely gone\nIn fact general ... in Hamilton the British commander in chief or in ... up here just puzzled as everyone else he reported quote there happened a very mysterious thing explaining that during the attack the Norfolk had drawn somewhat a head of the rest of the British line he went on a the fighting grew hotter\n\nAnd the ground became more wooded and broken up but the commanding officer of the ah of the unit I was sixteen officers and two hundred and fifty men still kept pushing on driving the enemy before I'm\nA among these art in Seoul's was part of a fine company and have been lifted from the king Sandra income estates nothing more was ever seen or heard of any of them they charged into the forest and were lost sight and sound not one of them ever came back\nThat's what the commander said a while back and Britain families were asking well where are they where's my uh husband's gold watch 'em or did you look for them\nUh and because of the horrors of World War one that was exactly time to take time out and search for the Sandra games it's suffice to say no one saw what happened to them and there was no evidence of them ever found again\nSo it was a mystery wasn't it or was it\nUm well at the end of the day when when Churchill abandoned the uh the offensive to knock turkey out of the war\nOr the the British and the commonwealth Canada and New Zealand Australia and Britain\nUh thirty six thousand died in this campaign or the end of the war they did the uh the math and the ... commission searched ... battlefields or to re bury a British Commonwealth dead thirty six thousand died in the campaign\nThirteen thousand were in on identified unmarked graves fourteen thousand at the bodies were flat out never found so never mind two hundred and fifty guys in the king's company fourteen thousand were never found\nWell I'm a few years after the war\nThe Reverend Charles peer point Edwards who was in ... on the war off his mission to find out what happened to the king's men because they became a cause the lab because of the the the the same as a background of this unit and ah the a prominent a widow's left back in Britain wondering what happened\nTo hobby your son or or whatever [noise] and the revenue Charles peer point Edwards examined the area where I kept bad she had been found a British officers cap badge indicating the fifth Norfolk a regimen\nUm they uncovered a mass grave with a hundred and eighty bodies a hundred and twenty two of them ... from the shoulder pads as they were warring or wearing as the ...\nUh the bodies have been found scattered over an area of one square mile to the very very rear of the Turkish front or and they were uh mainly surrounding a farm or of the Turks who would talk\nOf the story apparently was that this one British unit got so far out ahead of the British line they got cut off from the British surrounded by the Turks and that they died bravely in valiantly or in this farm house\nUh and that was how the uh the story seemingly ten years after the war or was settled but then at the fiftieth anniversary they deliberately deliberately landings are in April of Nineteen sixty five a former New Zealand engineer named Frank record\nA issued a extraordinary testimony a he said and I know this sounds crazy\nHe says on the afternoon the question he and his comrades had watched a formation of six or eight low shaped clouds hovering over the area where the Norfolk were pressing home their attack into one of these low lying clouds march the advancing\nBattalion an hour or so later the cloud very unobtrusive Lee rows and joined the other clouds overhead and sailed off or just first appeared in a New Zealand magazine obviously this is a fantasy and I'm Mr Reichert\nGraves with uh the Norfolk Senate he left out one key detail\nUntil years later he left out a detailed probably considered to be too shocking for the families and then it would cost too much upset for the rest of their lives\nThe detailed was that when he found this mass grave with the hundred and eighty men wearing uniforms undoubtedly centering ham sees dismissing company from the kings a royal estate in centering them\nThey all had a bullet in the back of the head\nBut as it turns out the Turks were not real good at taking prisoners especially in the middle of a firefight they uh they took a what probably happened was that these centering ham surrender or were ordered to surrender assuming\nYou know uh uh that uh you'd you'd have markets to queens very rules and they would be treated humanely as prisoners the church didn't do that\nThey line them up and they either banned that all of them are shot them we know this because one survivor was a New Zealand or\nWho actually told the truth he was surrounded by\nA British wounded and dying and he personally witnessed the Turks band adding them are rolling them over and shooting them are taking some information and shooting them in the back of the had he was personally saved by a German officer a and taken to the rear and\nTreated as a prisoner at the end of the war he didn't know what the unit was that was being executed like that\nBut he's the one who gave the eyewitness accounts and so a military mystery from Nineteen Fifteen was probably early was solved early on but the sense of decency by Reverend uh is what led to the mystery go on for decades\nBut it turned out to be just a atrocity in the middle of a a very very brutal war the missing company the ... are still a\nA bit of British Army lord to this day a movie was made about called all the king's men a BBC moving in Nineteen Ninety nine called all

was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause he panicked because of its roots with with with taking ritual\nBut you know the the ancient that counts I mean they they they they they worship anything\nUm resembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if if he if during sound when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some corn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the theme of what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nUm and and again you know as the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of\nA scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there is that there's a tradition of course I mean you look at exit is twenty two Eighteen you know thou shalt not suffer which to live on and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this was fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of the more uh obviously comes up every every year who in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing\nIn Nineteen eighty with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there doing investigation and looking to go in and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is that a weed you boards are strictly prohibited anyone using ... will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so [noise]\n[noise] so concerned that using the ... was going to open up you know demonic polls whatever oh yeah I I\nI agree with that one well no no but it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rule of you know sign this don't use it and so you know typically the concern is\nUh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kid that's where the concern came from and so it was ... that\nA kid the dresses up as a witch or a goal will become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party\nSo they they they they they make a case to distinguish it from all this is our way into the harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that\nThey'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something and ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's really interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and uh you know in in everything but I just um I just remember as a kid levine that it was it was like a fun scary\nAnd it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black lights in the uh\nWe were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even all the radio people still remember\nThis from from back then it will start walking haunted house there was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up a\nIt was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and then the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile\nAnd sometime you still had that candy when it came to Christmas [laughter] just the way it was right but I'm the\nMarathon bars on either right away I Am doing those\nHuge freeze those have you ever had um frozen\n... they were great oh I'm sure you're just taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grad that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop to because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written ... or something yeah and the ruler on the back\nOh man I I mean anything Googled after we're done here and uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was last year or so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably watch in the fight 'em there you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup ever on all the producers were were watching that so hey you guys are going on the air now are so well\nIs that is that you know\nIf it if girls can be seen with the with the naked eye and of course they often are 'cause the report is being seen then then by definition we should be able to see them on camera and of course that's why you have goes photographs or videos and stuff and if we can hear ghost and if you if there's a mysterious found her voice or something come from somewhere\nThen that means that that by definition their their material because you know\nSound is Adia waves and and you know hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing Adia waves and so\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded\nUm on on you know audio tape and and and and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used as that goes for the most part they are ones that the replicate what we can experience right we were all we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghost because people do report seeing them people record you know the recording them\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... field is actors and the problem is that there is no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS\nUm there's there's theories and there is speculation but but no one has ever proved that you know the location was high enough um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person or a who tried to do some stuff for something called the got home it\nUh and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science\nUh and goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think ... awesome they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want to you know we could talk about this forever but just for time's sake I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but what why why what is it\nWell you know um I I don't know it goes so I mean that that's you know of course that's that's a million dollar question right I mean you even even among the the gross founder and believers across the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their\nResidual events that are you know the stone tape theory that there is something that's going on in the you know some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and prevent the three played other people think that goes for international beams\nOther people say that they're you know the ... that that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions is problematic for ghost research right because\nGoats can't be both inner dimensional spirits\nAnd you know a an emotional recording into a tree or a house of murder and you know there's the dead so so ... if you have a phenomena of it has such a widely disparate range of explanations that is a problem so I\nI don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that that my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore explanation that would be there some sort of spiritual the debt that we were we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nMm good cell for windows for will is we so thank you for getting the information you have in fact

coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis ... talking with Ben Radford\nPerson intensely harming his own son so this was not this was not something that anybody was trying to hurt any random kids you know coming through\nMe and every now and then you'll see some story and and honestly because I follow these things every Halloween of that those and of course the scary clown scary clown panics 'cause I\nI'm suddenly the guy that talks about that but a lot of times ah there you know there there's a lot of them are just hoaxes I remember there was a guy I think it was in a in Cleveland or Boston or something about two years ago\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that ... that he had found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that\nAnd yet when the police busted him he said well I'll\nTrying to make sure the kid you not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you\nExactly exactly I was just such an offensive like first of all the you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year there was X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I wanted her but\nI wanted to ask you that I still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to actually that is that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dance often are actually the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost all you know\nIn for something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out [laughter] you know [laughter] yeah [laughter] I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nAnd my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure that okay but he did it yes so he could steal the stuff that he won\nThe ethics hear what you know we need to go back to the days when people are mommy for soles of of of you know purgatory this but you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted houses come out because you know those are cool and everything however\nIt was it primarily for money [laughter] 'cause it always raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it was primarily stricter the British Isles\nUh and then it came over with the with the first and second waves of of the ah the immigrants to the United states\n... and in fact we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials they have they were they were dead set against Halloween that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years I'm a court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask\nSo your people were having to be creative you know point though you'd actually our families coming together to make a kid's costume\n... and what you find is that uh the the first um the ... the first record that I found up Halloween masks\nAre really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as ornate and your plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a court for enterprise and you know it's it's ... it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who were you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer cost feature of a drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you have cinder all you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fun for sure um so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much when you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future\nHow do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well I assume your question you know I think that um you know when I mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations\nOf Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in a whole day and and you know we're with each it raised with each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far\nOr in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on um me but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum when I was like a dress up like a dress up right I mean eight year old kicked off just eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty you're fifty years or you could you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual or go you know where you\nGot like holographic you got to that because if you had that late this giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door and that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to ask them about

and ...\nWe are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all lost\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um ghost those tiny stuff so but so I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are getting\nLike and you know it works with the really serene theme um ghost tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween\nI Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it I mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't that you know\nAnd the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness and say panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean it's one of those things where I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know mall haunted houses you know reached out and grabbed her grow somebody or whatever I mean it's there's always some of that but\nBut you know that's you know for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who are just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and what not you know there's there's nothing the panic about a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause a candidate because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nUm resembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if if you drink some way and if you ask them you know if you told them about some some corn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the fans Katie what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nUm and and again you know the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of\nA seating and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at exit is twenty two Eighteen you know ... not suffer which to live um and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this is why uh there's of course not just Halloween that's that's one of the more obviously comes up every every year coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing\nIn the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons I'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to say James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go in and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it it said a weed you boards are strictly prohibited anyone using ... board will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so\nConcerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know do you want to ... or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was was that it was it was codified on a whole wall and it was I'd never seen that like you know in the rules you know sign this don't use it and so so you know typically the concern is\nUh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween it wasn't\nIt wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kid that's worth a concern came from and so it was ... that\nA kid the dresses up as a which are of goal will become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party\nSo if they they they they they make a case to distinguish it from Halloween this is our way into the harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that\nThey'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you\nKnow darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was it was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black lights in the uh\nWe were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations at W. A. K. why was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all as one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember\nThis from from back then it was a whacking haunted house there was nothing nothing scarier it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up a\nIt was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home in the next day you know that was that you eat eat candy for awhile\nAnd sometime you still had that candy when it came to Christmas [laughter] just the way it was right down the\nMarathon bars either right away I assumed on those\n[laughter] you freeze those have you ever had them frozen oh they were great oh I'm sure you're just taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to ah grad that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stopped because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nThey were and they came in that was like a red and black rapper written ... or something yeah\nAnd the real or on the back oh man I I mean anything Googled after we're done here that and uh and uh\nI didn't know that um that uh what's his face was lost USC McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably watch in the fight on there you go it's gone now is there any way\nThe original claim they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on the witness you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are eaten dusty Baker clients\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of get ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of the investigating and you'll get the get the cameras on and we're going to walk around here in all sorts of things\nAnd and and that that's part of the problem here is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that\nThat in almost all cases\nThey don't they don't have a good grasp of of of a of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample look so for example you'll see a goat undergoing a location maybe there's team of them and though you know they'll take readings for three hours or sick or wherever else they'll go home and analyzing\nThe problem is that's not nearly enough time\nTo get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um her mom or I'd normally need to know what's normal\nAnd whatever readings you get your walking around with the M.

camera and of course that's why you have goes photographs or videos and stuff and if we can hear ghost and if you if there's a mysterious found her voice or something come from somewhere\nThen that means that by definition there the material because we you know\nSound is Adia waves and and you know hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing audio waves and so\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded um on on your audio tape and and and and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used to detect ghost for the most part they are ones that the replicate\nWhat we can experience right we were all we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know if they're recording them\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... feel detectors\nAnd the problem is that there is no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation\nBut but there's no one has ever proved that you know that a location with high EMS um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person you're a who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it\nUh and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science\nOr in goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think they're awesome if they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one reason that I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want to you know we can talk about this forever but just for time's sake I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why why what is it\nWell you know um I I don't know it goes I mean that that's of course that's that's a million dollar question right I mean you've even even among the the grossed hundreds unbelievers\nAcross the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their\nResidual events that are you know the stone tape theory that there is something that's going on in the you know with some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and treat the the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the spirit that that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions is problematic for ghost research right because\nGoats can't be both in our dimensional spirits\nAnd you know a an emotional recording into a tree or a house of murder and you know here's the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomenal has such a widely disparate range of explanations that the problem so I I don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that\nThat my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore explanation that would be there some sort of spiritual the debt that we\nWere we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nThe good stuff for windows for Willis rules so thank you for getting the information you
