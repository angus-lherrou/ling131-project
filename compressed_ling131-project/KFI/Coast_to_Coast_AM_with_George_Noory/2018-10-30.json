I'm sure I'm sure they're they're done in a in a very careful manner very logical manner\nI mean that's that would create another problem all by itself how about the population in terms of uh the men and women fifty fifty what they're buying is that a market change\nYeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and I don't know why and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in law school at Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout it really isn't that high on that ... that sort of slip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said listen you want you you want to hassle of women there so you don't do it\n... which which have to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions\nAnd they're good one\nYeah oh excellent and was absolutely Exxon once and and uh so we're we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize\nA commerce you just want because it's going to be run by women\nUm what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\n[noise] that Generation Z was born ... being born right now is is actually a two thousand five she's ... twenty four\nSo in that fully there uh\nBut Gen Z is not going to be entirely different\nThan Gen Y ... that they're going to be this the same cyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller and generation X. generation X essentially is the parents of Gen Z\nA but it's what we're watching is is is a a a new crop of kids and and I tell folks that I feel is it ... ... people say well these these ... they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the money if they can't complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and he said let alone let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be find it just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated this as soon as they had to feed themselves\nAnd and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that\nI don't care listen it is what it is [noise]\nWhat ... listen here's here's how it works is zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want when you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some possessions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo all in all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah would you tell me\nThat makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country and it's horrible\nYeah it it troubles me it really does we not it's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a name for it and listen I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but\nWhen you have a president day takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah\nThat's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter thought that it would be used the tools like that I don't think so\nNo that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know is\nWhen you talk about the trends and change this is what we're losing can we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't you get ... they didn't agree with each other and in I've never seen that this bad him you\nKnow no I haven't and if it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's way where it's gone I I I just simply don't know\nYou know people ... I I I Can't tell you the number of people are George that say to me I you know why don't we run our our government like a business and and so we you know where you're going to have these huge deficits and we will make all these mistakes [noise]\nIf you think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like the government a diplomatic government or a Republican that's based on a constitution not one that's based on business principles\nTo that yeah we used to have that but now we have a government\nThat's actually run on business principles and it it seems like there's there's no you know we were just take it all we have removed the rules what taken away that they were taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat\nWhat's going on with China [noise] China had her freaky position China right now\nThey relaxed they drive their their child law law to write how many people uh how many children a family can have\nYeah they get really as many than what now which is the absolute positive did last thing they should have done [noise] it's it's like you know I don't know why I really don't and and listen I Am not that smart I'm really not in in in fear fear my wife and my kids they'll they'll tell you but\nHere you have a situation where we're trying to\nHold on for a second wherever the at the top of the hour we'll come back and talk about China plus will open up the phone lines as we talk about demographics and trends we're talking paranormal later on tonight\nDon't forget to watch our TV show beyond belief with George Mallory simply go beyond belief dot

website is linked up the coast to coast am dot com can China trendy up trending down\nChina's cooked call and it kind of I'm Sorry that but that's that's just like I Can't think of it in any other way to say what they've done is they've they've committed the biggest demographic blunder and a history of the world with that one child only policies\nThey did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy let now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate but ah how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies born is it\nDo not buyers that's for sure no\nSo what what you have is is they are missing now and it's this is a real number on a five hundred\nMillion people that were born five hundred million\nAnd a half billion so so here's here's how it works in any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people that make big incomes that have a big houses and consume a lot state federal and local tax\nI mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nAnd the the the starting at about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise]\nSo what's going to happen well well it cooked himself because they're going to have is actually a quarter of a billion elderly if they've got to support that can support themselves and now they they they have a whole new crop of of ah kids that can't support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen in how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah what what whenever a country gets in trouble um ... with their economy the first thing that they do is they said were rattled which is what they're doing\nAnd that's right exactly they go to war\nYeah they well they may they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has one and in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI I don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is they they don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not let's take some calls is our income ruining here for you Kenny let's go to Dana

fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he would he run and possibly win a presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys said and all they had was temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or try to bring down next man but more importantly it man has had\nActually a little one still at home I got that little one buddy young wife and crude and his wife and we had a president at something so bio it can't even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I was a fork and with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life if I did as if he was over a decade about so\nI don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't fight you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reaction\nIf you'll pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature that second thing I guess in Green Bay is sad it's sad I'm white now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm the I'm not an old guy there\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than I think that's that and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself it's men and women don't have time for now and then\nYou get a deal done we're not going to happen needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy that's ... that's when ward\nDiplomacy doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him ... how can you know ... it's at any one that was bankrupt four times and they had the fact that he can get back up yet on the horse\nI I I I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in it and he doesn't care if people calling the racist\nBecause God Knows what than it is hard and other oh no yeah well I ... it doesn't matter about his policy she knows she is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nAnd let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run a country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented you're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilets\nI'm used to pay the fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business\nThey're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a ... a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on ... do you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um ah the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish wouldn't happen\nNow but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says but\nI'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but if he let them spot what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in the punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I think what he has done is dignify it the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall right about now\nNo no no but but but I certainly would buy residential you\nWould I Would buy residential every day of the week yeah to sell or rent out yes [laughter] yeah no in fact I'm\nYou know I I have a house in them but either Springs Florida and I and I have a house in in ... Connecticut and a half and had her Connecticut's four thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just read all around in it and what we've decided to do is we're going to where we're going to come up with an executive rental forward\nAnd and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't want ... got to be very\nWell you've got the company like air being beat up they run to our house houses and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nReally they're very happy ... oh\nYeah and I am subscribe to that is what you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes\nOne of the things that that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and that that's going to you know remain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that essentially demanded\nA you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force than we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them ...\nOh yeah K. juicy direct dot com K.

it made it even easier\nIt's exciting though it's like I kind of like him\nUp safe from my perspective it's an exciting time to be alive it really is I I'm I'm enjoying this I think the best days are ahead not behind us I think the United states is going to see an economy that it doesn't understand and that's going to be a just launched by\nGeneration y that this monster generation that's fourteen to thirty three years old that it's going to start households and by dish soap and and by vacuum cleaners and furniture and automobiles\nLike the old days yeah I ... in talking to the you know I talked to all sectors in talking to my automotive sectors are cars that drive themselves are not going to happen\nGood good they already killed some old lady in Arizona for crying out loud\nYeah well in the trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks\nAnd I really don't have enough truck I you know what that what we\nNow would you like to have a truck behind you would know driver's city that\nAre not going to do it might not you know we I have a mini mini as little mini Cooper right I mean Cooper ... which is a high rise and I'm thinking to myself if I the first time I pull up next to I'm a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one tactical full paw just one to the rear ends you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper your history\nThat's that's where the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out of school bus it's over it's it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway in there you know the truck is parked there and the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nArguing how's how's how's the driverless trucks going to do that\nIt's not it it just not going to do it you know I think I go back to China for just a minute yeah please\nOkay one of the things that that a A R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from\nA forty years old and under there are about Ninety million\nOr um men are males or without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military and the it's the there there is just a ton and and that that's what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another means you're more break you know\nNo I just I I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it\nI'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South American ...\nUh we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil without water\nYeah we've got water we got fracking where we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know I\nAm one of those always missiles long Kenny\n[laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a king John hurt on and on North Korea I don't see that happening in ... in fact I Would I say in in Korea is going to be a unification of\nThe north in the south you know that the south is not having children there for ... heard that I don't like about one to\nHere's my concern although not from a country but from some terrorist group that obtains a new ... or something like that and they do it and try to plant it on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know is that the one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you can't possible it has to grow\nSo I don't know what's going to happen here with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... their their rights that are just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina hey Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher I guess my question is that uh the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the northeast intellect down south and at West 'cause like Florida is now the third most populous state outbreak in New York state and also in Phoenix has become the largest city out raking a Philadelphia\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Kenny\nThat that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shift ahead we cover every single state\nIf you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida over to ... California Nevada Arizona and New Mexico uh the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million wow what a buy real estate bite in Florida now\nAnd just sit on it and said I was in the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate

of all I Want to thank you for that and for sure be my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this is who says you got to tell me what I mean what did the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's\nThe paranormal it's been happening to me my whole life it started at age for my first paranormal experiences and Angelica experience a near death experience and just from that point on it just the the things had been happening randomly but quite frequently\nAnd uh I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then start talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or Family Matters but to to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college\nI'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lotta people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nIt it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have of it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of 'em actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching\n'em to two of my colleagues that after college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most negative thing I can think about there was a a a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide [laughter]\nYou know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate adviser\nYou know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know\nSeal the paranormal they and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community of of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist historian\nOr but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think uh my friend dean rate and who's the chief scientist\nAt ions good guy he uh yeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty five zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics\nSo that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools in in in ... or colleges and universities and from what he told me there is only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still did J. B. Ryan Institute thank God yes to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and then you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly are you supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting or on the Internet uh there are other podcast result they're dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just had a ... it's just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building a night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in in their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in she tells me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control or just happened randomly these things\nAh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and it and the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point at which they do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I Would try and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for live there about nine months so it was a winter time and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just ... my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because\nSometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanting to take a little nap and it's too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nButt relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crime myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an angelic presence and it it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be OK took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing cycling right to see 'em\nThere's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or buy a ferry or boat or there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there's no hospital so\nUh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and and that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nFound dead in his cell was murdered deputy sound Michael Jordan as

was seizing like a horrible earthquake but you know there were fissures in the ground and you couldn't stand up it was so bad and mountains were crumbling and the sky was turning the dark color and it was just like an end of the worst end of the world kind of a pocket\nLipstick scenario and I woke up in a in a sweat and and nervous and scared and\nI I went to breakfast with my uh friends are just like a continental breakfast and I told them about this nightmare and then we proceeded to the uh the base\nAnd uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so so that was my um my pre cognitive or or premonition dream that wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nOr the you know an a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event and later I learnt a that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare some more much more specific than mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there is my daughter had more than it was too we didn't know that yeah we didn't know what it was bruised but uh\nShe she she had the vision she was ah in in a city where ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep um but you know then then you like a day later and happened and she said that was\nYeah yeah some people have it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who have a verified that this that this happened to them and so there is something to that this this that that that people had since that an ... and I'm On a massive scale so which is and it's been studied uh I think\nThat the rate in

trips\nOn the Oregon Coast in at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a card should look at it and send me

king or jak face card\nA very often we get we get a right\nTo the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter a blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop or in my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and that she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from it so it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but\nThink I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big sort of experience\n[noise] I I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you

were driving to you know the big tall trees it's very ... and as I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit\nAll of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark but it was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat\nAnd a ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she and she said what what are you talking about big foot I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she she [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep drive me\nAnd I said well we got to find a hotel there is one here another miles from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later\nI found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of

we're going to get to your calls as well as we talk about time was the paranormal world just so many different kinds of paranormal stories you've had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket or the title alone kind of makes you shiver\n[laughter] well I grew up in a in a I'm In a region American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral I'd I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it\nAll of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was hoping to me and he said ah ah Bruce it's it's it's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of\nUh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut uh I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then that typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um it it it was kind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird wasn't it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out and\nSee what the suit was they're very curious\nI think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kinda paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh well do you have to fight for it I didn't really have\nTo fight that was that that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it isn't offered it at the college\nAnd I am a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and\nSo I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size said most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could've accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues and and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California\nOr younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it ... they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but there are a couple that are a little skeptical\nIncluding one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the or seven weeks in the course into the course\nUm and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience of really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different to you know types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fun ... that's\nA hunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your oh Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in a ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing give me your scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you\nThe I've had two full affirmation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria and a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in uh in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases\nIt was it was shocking to say the least but uh\nIt uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying\nI think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my impression of and my explanation for what's going on with that now it's different than when I ... A M visited by someone who's passed on and I I might see an image of them in my mind but not\nLike out in the in the open kind of thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent what they would call and intelligence spirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or or residuals spirit\nPsycho ... the ability to manipulate mind over matter\n[noise] I was the uh the

just had this incredible feeling of tragic sadness I mean it was and then the\nWill Gettysburg has a lot for example what's that Gettysburg has a lot\nYeah I've never been to get these for I've always wanted to go and I've heard a lot of stories about I'm sure I Would make some very strong connection there but I definitely felt that it dark\nOut very it was a very hard experience I'm Glad I went but it was very tough to to be there\nUsually is in San Diego I Julie go ahead\nYes hello Hi there Hi George and George I am so happy that top few will now\nYes let's I wanted to come on and of course it's hard to get on when you first\nStarted ... are now when you first started I get Ken Martin lunch but that was so long ago okay so here's what I wanted to tell you first of all I Am from St Louis Missouri ahah I ... I was born and raised there um and I moved here when I was about fourteen\nAnd I'm I'm also a Gemini and I'm a few years younger than you do it\nSo I'm I'm a deal in second grade\nEasy Los your lawyer yeah exactly\nAnd here's the way when I tell you I remember you said once before so this is the perfect time to call you said once before you were interested in people who have seen spirit ... and I have been seen them I I did and I I totally agree with you George how you feel that the reason\nI I actually I did\nStart with that when I was in about sixth grade but when I was around twelve I started the spirit and the first one I saw and and I do have a question for you Bruce on that real quick the first one I saw I Will never in my life forget because it was completely unexpected\nAnd it was in the doorway when I was getting ready for school it was a\nCat it was actually half of a cat but ... other cat dragged itself across the doorway what was the other half\n... uh well here's what I don't know but it was dragged its legs were going way far out in front of it like dragging itself across\nAnd it was clear as day and I see many after that\nI actually contacted one who am I had a name for real weird name I wasn't going to say it on the air but I Will quote quote down and I actually named the cats after ... graders but I saw these every day and I even which show all my friends and\nOnce at the YMCA in St Louis I wanted to tell you that George\nI don't know if you remember the YMCA I when I went in the way back then there was a\nStairway that was all dark and I shut the door and had all these kids sit on the stairs and I asked this that's the show itself and it was it looked like this big fell that appeared right like on a movie screen alone and yeah\nSo I Know many I I once I had a girl I took her and it's always better when it's dark I took her in a closet and I spent the night at our house\nAnd I asked him to calm and that spirit started shaped shifts gate and I remember it was in India and then it was a I I remember the Indian real ... you know it's kept shapes yet\nIs it still following you Julia\nNo no no I I'm I'm really really I'm concerned about keeping myself and that's a good thing you asked that 'cause it's leading and then my question\nWhich really have a minute for so much and good\nOkay I'm very concerned about keeping myself in a positive\nLight I ... you know I I pray and communicate with McCain does every day and and here's the thing I've been told them very psychic I've been told I Am a medium but when I was about Nineteen I cut myself off from that each has I didn't want to deal with any real negative energy [laughter]\nSo I feel like I'm not using my gift and I'm just wondering your take on it\nShould she be afraid of negative energy is a minute left Burr's\nShe uh she should be very cautious and uh when you when you get into the spiritual mowed the connection I always say something like I'm opening up by I use the star trek thing I'm opening up a all hailing frequencies to all good and kind spirits\nAnd with my spirit guides also helped me there are also called gatekeepers to protect to protect me from any

thank you thanks guys hey can I have\nI called because I have a phone compact with you I'm just here me out and then I'll listen to your response so two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war\nUm he's not a diplomat so all of those politicians that have with us in the I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman bird I wanted to see two things you first of all I'm he called her horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the porn star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that warrior here's what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he could run and possibly win\nA presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys said and all the yeah was temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or tried to and bring down this man but more importantly that man has kids especially a little one still at home I got in that little one but a young white include and his wife and\nWe had a president and did something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was paying for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did that if he did that was over a decade about so\nI don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nTrump it's reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he is reactionary if you have found him he's going to come back at you that's human nature the second thing I disagree that is sad is that\nI'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm the I'm not that old guy either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than a big business and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business as myself this is men and women don't have time for non Stan\nYou'd get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a

ward diplomacy doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him\nBecause he's a no nonsense visits that anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up yet on the horse\nI got I I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in a dish and he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what than it is hard and other people know that ... ... it it doesn't matter about just diplomacy she knows she is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that so\nI disagree with you on both of those um things\nAnd let's get get his comments data in a few comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things with can you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think he did to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented you're not going to pay you thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilet\nA fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business\nThey're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that uh our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a ... a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to come as young as you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um uh the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nNow but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his

I'm enjoying this I think the best days are ahead not behind us I think the United states is going to see an economy that it doesn't understand and that that's going to be a just launched by\nGeneration y that this monster generation of fourteen thirty three years old and it's going to start households and by dish soap and and by vacuum cleaners and furniture and automobiles like the old days yeah and certainly in talking to the you know I talked to all sectors in talking to my automotive sectors are cars that drive themselves are not going to happen\nGood good they're already killed several lady in Arizona for crying out loud\nYeah well in the trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks\nAnd I really don't have enough truck driver you know what that what we\nNow would you like to have a truck behind you would know drivers\nAre not going to do it might not you know we I have many you know what I mean he is a little mini Cooper rang I may Cooper ... which is a hot right and I'm thinking to myself with like the first time I pull up next to I'm a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one technical for Paul just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper your history\nThat's that's where the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck picks out of school buses over it it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you\nKnow I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway in there you know the truck has park there in the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store arguing how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt's not it it just not going to take I go back to China for just a minute yeah please okay one of the things that are\nStruggling demographers about China right now is there are a from\nA forty years old and under there about Ninety million or um men are males or without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military and that it's there there is just a ton and and that that is what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another major war breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ...\nI just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth is the Americans and that is a you know carry the United states Mexico central and South America\nOr we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil and we'd go water yeah we've got water we got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know\nI Am one of those always missiles so\nGuinea [laughter] yeah yeah but I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like Kim Jong un in a North Korea I don't see that happening are in fact I said I said what I say in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north\nAnd the south you know that the south is not having children there for like heard that I like about one to\nHere's my concern although not from a country but some some terrorist groups that obtains new or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me yeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you can't possible it has to grow\nSo I don't know what's going to happen here with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher I guess my question is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and at West 'cause like Florida is now the third most populous state out raking\nNew York state and also in Phoenix has become the largest city out raking are filled out here people are moving to the warmer weather Kenny\n... that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shift ahead\nWe cover every single state if you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada um Arizona and New Mexico\nUh the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million while or buy real estate bite in Florida now and just sit on it\nYeah I said I ... the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens and Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a bus and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate gonna if you're not going to ask what if it meant when will begin to\nSoften and I told her I said listen it hasn't started\nIf you're a woman does it's going to be huge\nOr it's going to be off the charts what's the same thing that's happening was healthcare elder Karen desk here\nFor a Vegas is that a good market\nBoot off the charts huge can't believe it I it it's a for one or if it's cheap there are plenty of jobs\nOr or I go there all the time my brother has a house there uh yeah Vegas

co founded the boots to books transition course now that's the first college course in the country designed specifically for recently returned veterans\nBruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for sure be my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program\nAnd I love the show I'm looking forward to this this is as you got to tell me what I mean what did the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's\nThe paranormal has been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experience it was an ... experience a near death experience and just from that point on it just the these things have been happening randomly but quite frequently\nAnd ah I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or family others but to to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college\nI'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nAll a lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about us all experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nA word that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching\nTo two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most\nNegative thing I can think about there was a\nA a friend of mine her daughter is a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide [laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\nYou know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the\nSeal the paranormal the and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community of of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist you know historian\nOr but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo ah to do much with it in fact I think uh my friend dean rating who's the chief scientist at ions good guy he uh yeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so\nThat's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities and from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's\nBut I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to him there seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcaster who's out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI ... I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and ah I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just it just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some stories so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once more people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in and their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce all of ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in she tells me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control or just happened randomly these things\nAh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and it and the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point which to do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I Would try and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a wintertime and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick or very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and it was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep a crime myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an engineering\nPresidents and it it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything\nWas going to be okay it took away all my fear and uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and\nAnd my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never question did I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic right to see um\n[noise] there's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this was a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or buy a ferry or vote or there was no bridge you had to that island so there's very remote there's no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and then that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nExperiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another experience where I\nI uh uh was playing around it was in a um a up a deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception pass in the
