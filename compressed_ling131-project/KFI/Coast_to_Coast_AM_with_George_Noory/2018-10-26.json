from earth and the spirit of shape that surround our entire solar system including the ...\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at mayor files dot com report for people to see what our solar system

planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHe announced back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud preventive\nBrown simply called the planet nine because he's the astronomer that got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades\nIt was twenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called era out in the hype rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that Pluto or should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to dwarf planet\nIn the ... belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten\nThat was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing a goat whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits\nClose quote now that is why so far it is an indirect discovery it's now late twenty eight teams\nSeveral tries at the hacking super ... territories in Hawaii to find planet nine and visible light and or infrared professor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet to be only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this elusive planet nine or planted act that he uh is it still trying to mine and he told me\nThat he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun so that is putting it in a spot that is something like ... times further than Neptune all good way out there but they had narrowed down the focus so\nThe river are we going\nOn November first started another surge because the calculation\nPredict that planet nine is closer to a car elation that can only be seen by American I in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology planetary science department in Pasadena, California it struck me professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November the date when you start the member first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eye because so far the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what your I Would say just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky and once once we find planet nine looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees and the son that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might just have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or that it was inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what it could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a ... a tune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clones it's probably too cold have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGray and white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good way out there\nAny that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter like ... it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is

hotter\nAnd it showed that Miami for example the extra days of temperatures above ... degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century for Miami Seventy eight more days he's Miami isn't already underwater\nSo what was something like a one in a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so there's really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what our computer models showing to do is have you worked on the eye BCC report about what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to do\nIt could be substantially worse than even those that estimate\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included my adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assume that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which was or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem if that cater to decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from ...\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned both on the east coast and the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of\nThat's the migrants but it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger enforced migrate as their cities\nBecome uninhabitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you've got ... million of such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect\nNorth America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and ... and ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of course she fare\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency during the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist\nBut this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we should have those figures show\nTo global climate change in increasing more could definitely bring more

beginning at seven thirty PM mountain\nAnd another time around the country in the world I've been in my office where I'm Talking to you tonight in front of this computer to share news with the general audience that is growing around the world from my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell just three weeks ago in October third I was doing update on three category the first had to do with the very\nDistressing subject of how cat had a cat\nAround the world like\nWeird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox is in a car wreck kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspot solar observatory shut down I had received a whistle blower email saying that are actually uh the child pornography was just funny deflection\nThat he actually involve the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Holland an air force base\nThat down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then third update had evolved from I asking my or fires YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body the typically I was asking for ages four to six approximately and I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone before and this is what I was\nTalking about when the next\nMorning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream\nSo I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird uh I sent them\nUncle to a photo shop a video and also I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book for all\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a my er files report what are the smoky fog sometimes link to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analysts was that he thinks this is truly anonymous\nAnd uh then I asked a that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office\nAnd believe it or not a second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder\nOn October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me\nEmails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like at the plaza I Do not know this is extremely a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters I began to see how heart felt that there were people who were telling me they had never mentioned any of the parents to loved ones their children to parent\nNone they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight\nThinking about all of this is provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard\nI'm Talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now some city center Florida ...\nWhich was in the spring of two thousand and age and I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn sure the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facilities and things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the ... of them myself and just lay there and look outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with you stars that I can see and then suddenly I just\nI was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I opened them again\nAnd through the window I can see this misty grade ball drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that\nIn this dark bedroom it was luminous and I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looks like it's coming right for my head and I was just frozen\nThe fascination of I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my

me and be answered simultaneously\nAnd I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it I didn't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on

are not alone\nOil first Gulf War and I wanted to say is when I was fall but of the year there were no controls that I could see anything besides what it was a little bit bigger than the person that was in it right\nAnd I'm Wondering to myself how we control the just the hounds is being done I haven't seen that from that day to now not believe in front of me or for that ...\nThat to be right

in October of twenty Eighteen what do you think today at age fifty seven\n[laughter] I think it's obvious that our government isn't telling the truth about a lot of this thing and I think that all of this though you know I've never seen\nAliens per se meaning the grave or any of them but\nAfter he gives pretty credible now because you have the Internet and people were posted flying craft wine and chew stuff that don't fly is flying with no moving parts and I think our government knows a lot way more than what they're telling us\nBeing a big it all goes together the UFO stuff or what the government is doing\nAnd that all of the ancient history having to do with religious figures could be advanced technology being used by advanced intelligence is in this cosmos\nExactly where you'll use your extraterrestrial whatever you want to you they don't want to tell you about it and so many people are being punished because it's something that the fault why are you worried about what

where\nThe desks and being in here have been detected in a dozen of oil paintings like one of them was over a thousand years old [noise]\nAnd then you jump to what I was exposed to it currently in the

things in the night\nAnd tonight I've been trying to share some of the more serious slices related to uh the issue of what might come back into this dimensional existence a after a death of sort of an afterlife\nI Would like to share with you and our coast Saudi and\nAn example of one of the many emails that I have been getting tonight and this is an indication that the quality and the heart felt and the profound emails that I had been receiving any various categories having to do with out of body\nOr what the ... fog is and here I Want to read this trip came this a few minutes ago\nListening to you on coast to coast while writing this my father was very involved with the world war two Pearl Harbor Hawaii survivors during his life\nHe passed away on December seventh two thousand and nine and was buried on December seventh before his burial I was sorting things out in his home office with his caregiver\nHe lived in this home for almost six years which I currently still on the news do not live there\nSorting out his items I was looking through the open door\nInto the laundry area hallway adjacent back door I saw a very fast thin moving horizontal Smokey grey fog go straight through the back door without it being opened up\nIt went through the door I did mention this to my wife son daughter in some close friends\nI Am an open minded conscious oriented person but immediate feeling was my dad showed me his spirit was leaving the home for good I Would have never expected to see the gray color\nI wouldn't normally thought it would have been associated with something negative but he was a very positive person\nI have come to the conclusion that whatever part or level of his body consciousness soul left the house\nMay have been more like the gross more earthly matter in its purest form I had never heard the word smoky fog until you offered them up all night and this is what it's been in my own office and\nI have wondered if it relates to the love that cat\nThat I lost a year ago and that that to the young ones the big furry ones that everybody loves chocolate and fluffy now\nI just keep wondering could it have been that cat that I Love so much a or I have a cousin\nWho passed the about four months ago she was Ninety six years old sharpest attack even a passing it was her body that gave out a she always said that she would try to show me that she had survive\nOn my mom and dad have been gone for a long time but you never know\nBecause I really do think that this foggy smoke that you can find Google when you start Googling foggy smoke you will see amazing photographs\nOr that resemble what has been in my office and if it is something from another dimension trying to come and get my attention and the YouTube channel I Wonder why have you ever encountered this charge\nNo I haven't had something like that but the ... these are magnificent stories and emails I but I Do get a lot of emails from people who have had similar experiences yeah there's something very strange going on in your gym\nYou cannot rule alone the fact that it's real yeah humor loopholes\nYes and the profound I'm going to be doing an entire series and may and one of my uh end of November coast I think it's going to be\nWith at least two of the people who have had childhood uh separating body and that's the question\nIs it the very soul that leaves the body how could that be\nIf it is not the sole that needs to animate the container organic body what part is it that is moving out from the body in out of body travel\nAnd there are all kinds of explanation in ancient each Egypt about there being nine part to the body and the so complex but we don't even acknowledge our soul in the western world and it probably is the most important part of us\nAnd when you go back to ... ages four or five and six and you read these extraordinary emails coming from people who say in their opening sentences I have never told a single human being in my life\nAnd I am now provoked from listening to your asking the question on your YouTube channel have any of you at age four to six [noise] do you remember an out of body because that is significant\nSure where was the learning there was nobody teaching this is something that must be spontaneous training of the soul\nA new body container\nWould you buy I sent you an email I think you've got to make sure you follow up for us on this virus or you know checking children ... yeah\nThe polio or something like the polio in November I Will so I'd probably it'll be related to out of body ease incredibly profound

thousand and two silver was four dollars announce near the cost of production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely not nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nWith the times silver was trading near its production cost and industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nSolar in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the place to go down\nYou know I guess not but could silver reach higher than a hundred dollars announce\nHope you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach us all time high so we think of one hundred dollars is well within reach\nOne could that happen over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential and silver right now\nGo back to Alan ... things up go ahead Ellen\nThe district in this universe that

October seventeenth that was not hear any longer indivisible formed than thirty frames of one second\nAnd it's puzzling but um I I have come in in my own intuitive feel is that it it is a or was the spirit of loving cat of mine who passed a year ago um that that cat was like a human being to me a furry soul\nAnd several people around the world I've probably gotten twenty emails from people who Medicaid or are involved with various kinds of um meditation type of forms to access and they have all gotten the impression that both times that this has been my cat\nThe one that had passed and I feel that intuitively\nThat gives me a comfortable feeling why shouldn't we be educated about the possibility\nThat a soul that passes because a body sales can actually return even if it's for one

was working in New York City at the year was I Believe uh the fall of eighty three\nAnd I was working on a film for UNICEF or about their twenty fourth anniversary and efforts to save children's lives around the world and I\nThe book the twelfth planet and I was reading it and I wanted to meet whoever Zacharias itching was because I had done a strange harvest in Seventy nine to eighty and was very

she was the secretary for Zacharias itching and I set up a meeting I had an address I had been in New York long enough to know exactly where I was going in a taxi\nBut when the taxi stopped I sure knew where I was I was in front of the Rockefeller Center and I'm thinking second highest situation has an office in the uh the Rockefeller Center\nAt a secretary so I went in ah gave the name of who I was going and the meeting a I was passed over to a elevator told that when I got out of something like the thirty second floor I was to walk a certain distance and I would be looking for a certain

sizable\nAnd the interesting thing about this there's several things about it it had no tail and know injected no fragments from it\nAnd it had a bluish green glow coming from the bottom of it a very interesting report just a few minutes ago I checked the American media society to see if they had recorded a meteor site in there and\nI cannot find one for the same time and date location so this must have been a very interesting site in as my as my suspicion [noise]\nThree and a half hours later in Winston Salem North Carolina gentleman walked out on a balcony to have a slow\nAnd he became aware of the fact that something was directly above his head he looked up and he estimates not more than fifty or a hundred feet above him there was a triangular crowd with orange and red lights on the trailing edge of it and they flashing he could see\nPeter on and the site in a flashing bright red light\nOn the a dorsal surface of the object\nVery interesting sighting after the first object to saw moved to the east towards Winston Salem it reports\nHe realized that there was a second one above it headed a different direction added to the north instead of east and the second or two later he realize there was a third similar looking object in the night sky or make the the morning sky this was six o five am\nOn Tuesday of this week the twenty third of October very interesting report and he's provided for a very nice illustrations that are posted to our website\nThe third report comes from Rockford, Illinois a woman reports that yesterday morning at six thirty seven AM she was driving

programs starting with planet X. story Linda the just the just fascinates everybody doesn't it\nIt does and they keep becoming more interesting it was nearly three years ago at the end of January twenty sixteen I reported at ... dot com and Mike coast to coast AM radio broadcasts then\nThat a new ninth planet or planet X. was indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt and the ... cloud meet\nThe ... belt is a disc shaped residue of rock\nDust and ice left over from our solar system creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto to about fifty astronomical unit from our son and the crowd of mostly ice and us goes much further\nStarting where the hype rebelled in an extension for three point to light years from earth and us fear Rickles shape that surround our entire solar system including the Khyber adult\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at Meyer files dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I have a planet nine was indirectly found in twenty sixteen because\nTo date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object but Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHere now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nProtests around simply called the planet nine because he's the astronomer they got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades\nIt was twenty three and protests are brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called Aaron ... out in the type rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argue that Pluto should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to adore planted in the ... belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWell when I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing the ghost whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the hacking Subaru observatories in Hawaii to find planet nine invisible light and or infrared professor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet to be only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this elusive planet nine or planted act that he uh is it still trying to mine and he told me\nThat he is planning another trip\nTo Hawaii November first just in a week\nAnd this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement and for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun so that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than\nGood way out there but they had narrowed down the focus\nSo he deliberately going on November first started another surge because the new calculations\nPredict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the coast ... which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe at most two we have to wait until the ... up to the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far the brightest part do we think it's going to have is just sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right what's wrong with she just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes which really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky and once once we find planet and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system perturbation and even just in the plane of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where it looks I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail was probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly chewing enough direction so it will be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real plan it's like ... and real planets sometimes people say oh this new plan of nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like ... it's five thousand times more massive [noise] this is what we mean when we say a planet and the other part of the choices\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might just have come from why is this massive\nObject all the way out to the edge of the type rebel going into the or cloud and you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet\nOr any ... inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is\nOur but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but in two we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition is all of this is just speculation\nYou can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like that too we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think it's about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year oh no it's not even close to a quarter lightly it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the rebels and the or cloud\nHave no confusion about the fact that if there was something\nThat we're trying to move in our solar system what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury and mercury out you wear a now and that's our biggest uh gotten down to a dwarf planet out in the hype about\nThat there's nothing they could out coming way map that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity\nThat that's the thing about gravity and now\nIt it would impact on every single thing and\nActually I would've loved those ... have been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if he would have been able to convince him about that new bureau\nWell I don't know how much time left but I can start my own work that I had gotten a fake eye to eye is that right yeah and maybe what I'm saying that for conversation end of it 'cause it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat even if\nHe doesn't agree in some of the series that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that that could be planted but when you read like say out and not true scholar in the translation that we're a car\nAnd you look at the carving one thing that I\nCan give me talking about is Trump\nAnd they can of worms and letting guy\nTo hold on right there in the most

and the New York times on September twenty says did a large map in a section called dangerous stage your hometown is getting hotter\nAnd it showed that Miami for example the extra days of temperatures above Ninety degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century for Miami Seventy eight more days Miami isn't already underwater\nSo what was something like a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what are computer models showing to do is have you worked on the eye BCC report about what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to do\nIt could be substantially worse than even those that estimate\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included my adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we're going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which was or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem was that cater to tickets from the\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned votes on the east coast and the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger and forced to migrate as their\nCities become um inhabitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you've got ... million of such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all of a wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect\nNorth America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing now in Europe that part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to\nLot of the ... she fare\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from post\nBut this has been something that has been identified by loss of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency during the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the same mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we feel it has for years ago\nSo global climate change and increasing more could definitely bring more wars\nYes go\nWell it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control and one of the big headline this summer of twenty Eighteen million for at home may see sea level rise flooding over the next breath of this century and in fact it is so bad that\nAll the forty eight continental US state\nFlorida now has the most property at risk a study finds that three hundred and fifty one billion dollars worth of homes will be risking persistent title flooding\nThe researchers say if the global warming and sea level rise does continue that in more than one million properties in Florida will have chronic flooding\nAnd that when you look at the map as it is extended by computers over the rest of the century\nThat sea level rise which is already\nOne of the big secret uh kept in Miami by the political institution there\nIs that they get flooding constantly on full moon like constantly flooding on high tides they get constantly flooding all of the time and everybody who live there now is it and that political governments and Mary saying we're not going to let anybody know that we have flooding in the streets of Miami nonsense\nThey've got to take the bull by the horns and deal with it\nAnd as you work at the map\nUh knowing that the Arctic\nHow many times faster than the computer projection well George when you look at the map of what is expected to happen over the next ... years and now that what happened with the Arctic was hit it three times faster\nBoard had water flooding let's say three times faster than the current computer projects that man that none of the southern tip of where it will be uninhabitable and that eat back what professor drew she got what they\nAnd since then on most Wednesday evening's beginning at seven thirty PM mountain\nAnd another time zones around the country in the world I've been in my office where I'm Talking to you tonight in front of this computer to share news with the general audience that is growing around the world from my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell just a three weeks ago in October third I was doing updates on three categories the first had to do with\nVery distressing subject of half cats be headed cats\nAround the world bloodless\nWeird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox is in a car road kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspots solar observatory shut down I had received a whistle blower email saying that are actually uh the child pornography was just funny deflection\nThat he actually involved the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Harlem in air force base\nUh the down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then the third update had evolved from my asking my profiles YouTube channel audience on September twelfth anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately and I had received a huge number of emails\nAnd a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was\nTalking about when the next\nMorning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream\nSo I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird or I sent the puzzle to a photo shop a video and also I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a my er files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to after life returns you can see the whole story and you can see these videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the front of shop analyst was\nThat he thinks this is truly anonymous and uh then I asked\nA that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office\nAnd believe it or not a second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder\nOn October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me\nEmails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like act applies than I Do not know this is extremely a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters I began to see how heart felt that there were people who were telling me they had never mentioned any of this\nParent to loved ones their children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight thinking about all of this\nIs provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office\nWhen I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard\nOr talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida home\nWhich was in the spring of two thousand and age\nAnd I was preparing that morning for I'm going to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn string the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down and very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bad it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what kind of like maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bad coverage of them myself and just lay there and look outside and leave on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see\nAnd then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I opened them again\nAnd in the window I can see the misty great I'm drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was in this dark bedroom was luminous\nAnd I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming writes in my head and I was just\nThe fascination of I didn't know what to think then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted hire a glass passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was feeling of euphoria and one is with this living thing that was surrounding me and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time\nI was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers was coming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously and I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it\nI don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of the ... that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of what kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head ... possibly\nKnow there were no word there was no sound the hiring glitz we're almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I could see peripherally these high regrets but they had the same texture of the fall and good would shadow in life\nBut they were living minutes at the same time and they were just float by me but kind of ...\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a downloaded information\nThat was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was the super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable\nIt's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it would be given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any sub text in your mind\nOr your soul about who would be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it made because of my past experience with ever since I was a child I've had psychic dreams\nDreams of having relationships with an entity that was giving the instructions\nI can describe the entity to you as a very thin very white pale density I couldn't see his face all I Know it was very skinny it had a very long fingers\nThe random to go out that feeling I get from that I Am before voting feeling\nThat everything is going to get more violent and wetter\nYes now um last night's ... well it is and things can being well then they started with the issue of uh I was asking people if they had had any kind\nOf childhood out of body in the ages four to six a which is amazing to me how many people have been provoked by that\nThat seemed to overlay the appearance of whatever the white uh we'll call it ... smokers smoky fog than period in my office twice\nThat led to my asking for a whether people had had these kind of foggy white stuff\nAnd that led to Charles hazard and other even mailers who are saying that this is not the only person last night on my YouTube channel I had a dialogue with my audience\nAbout has anybody whether they're in a duck and experience or meditate or had they had any insight about water a lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower science is that that uh you work on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six\nIn which there could be some either a natural cycle or something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that they're going to be like a shift or a joke\nAnd that it would cause in armies in tremendous amounts of flooding and I had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them about exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural drain cycle\nInteracting with planets in our solar system that could relate and knowing what that is written about in general\nAnd that is how woven and a complex\nAll seem to be going that every single question is leading to answer that people are raising more issues and scientists are also coming forward and saying that they have information about this and so tonight if there's anybody listening on ...\nIf you are in the military government whistle blower category or human abducted category and you have any information about a huge water\nThat could end up affecting our planet where they challenged him\nCall us with conversations with Linda which is
