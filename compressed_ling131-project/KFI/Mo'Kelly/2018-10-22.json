hypothetically or John Case it was someone who was more in the traditional mold of Republicans does that mean you didn't leave the Democratic party to go back to the Republicans\nNo because I think when I look at other issues like gun reform like climate change like gender equality income inequality these are all issues and I feel very strongly about and I think that the Republicans are under complete\nWrong side of them and so just if Donald Trump goes way to mother doesn't change how I feel about a lot of these issues that really the Democratic party at the champion other Republicans tried to pretend like there aren't problems at all then what\nDrew you to the party originally because some of these students\nHave not changed at all some have evolved I should say a Michael Steele last night on the program said the pretense of being fiscally conservative that he called it a pretense what is the greatest allure or the greatest silly point of the Republican Party having nothing to do\nWith Donald Trump I think when I look at the time that I became a Republican\nIdea that we should have a government that is living within its means that is responsible that is um that there is a check and balance involved I think the reality of a federal government itself is it's incredibly wasteful or the idea that we could keep\nGrowing government programs when they function completely dysfunctional\nAnd waste billions of taxpayer dollars is just downright annoying to me when I Know that there is a better way to do and we can use technology to ensure that every dollar is accounted for and spent the way that it should be said that I have an objection to the programs themselves it's that governments terribly administering them and I think for a long time Republicans talked about

opportunity to not work on one\nNot two but three presidential campaigns it started first with Newt Gingrich you think he's an old head and the game but not exactly and then it went on to Mitt Romney and then it went on to a Dr Ben Carson if that wasn't enough he served in the Trump Administration under Dr Ben Carson as a secretary\nOf housing and urban development I'm Talking about sure Michael single tend\nAnd we he knows that I've been working on this conversation for quite some time and this New Orleans guys finally in front of me let me just say this good afternoon or how you doing I'm doing great morning sorry fella long to make this happen but you know whereas my grandmother says better late than never\nAnd it's also funny because we have a lot of people in common that we didn't even know it's it's like the only two degrees of separation\nNo I mean from terrorists admired all of these people that were hanging out with yesterday and then you realize you know it's not a lot of us meaning people who look like us in this space so I think it makes sense for us to sort of want to stick together [laughter]\nIt's funny because you come up the escalator today and you are walking alongside Michael Steele the former aren't see chairman who I consider a friend in a in a mentor in many ways how has he influenced you and your professional career\nI have known Michael Steele since I was a sophomore at Morehouse is when I first met him and I stayed in touch with them ever since and so he's sort of advise and sort of help sort of guide and my career literally from college through the various presidential campaigns to now and even now if I have questions about something I'll call them\nOr if he's thinking about something that he saw on TV he'll call and say hey this could have been a better articulation or you should have meant mentioned this\nSo he he is one of those elders he was always sort of looking out and I I've been here I Want to help you be better in in complex more accomplished more than when I was able to accomplish that led me sort of help you sort of guide you're on the way you can avoid some of the pitfalls that I was unable to avoid so he's a great guy I think the world of him\nI mentioned him and I also want to mention Dr Christopher ... because these are mutual friends of ours is\nAnd people I respect as far as being able to articulate the Republican message the conservative message and it seems like there are very few of those individuals who are are adequate in terms of being able to make the case for Republicans without all the noise would you agree\nNo I I Would agree a hundred percent and I think when you think about a Michael Steele Dr ... ah terrorists set Myer\nUh and I guess ... she's not African American was still a minority there was a handful of us you have Charlie Sykes who's Caucasian you have Max Boot over at CNN he's a Caucasian or Bill Kristol I mean there are a handful\nOf individuals who are conscious and aware of the diversity of the country but they're also authentic and their analysis an assessment of conservatism of what it means to be a conservative and they understand\nThe importance of tradition they understand the importance of values understand the importance of customs of behavior and how all of those things are critical\nUh to upholding our beliefs as a republic but they're also critical as we are becoming more diverse society as our culture somewhat changes as a virtue or a byproduct of that diversity and so they recognized as a Edmund Burke once wrote the conservative Las furry we reform to conserve\nMeaning conservatism or conservatives aren't against change skeptical of some type of change of course\nA but change that we deem necessary it's beneficial to society we're not against that we reform our beliefs and our value system so that we can adjust ourselves accordingly and unlike what we see coming from the craziness that Trump is and I think all of us attempt to our best to articulate that were on air through our commentary drought writings et cetera\nHow do you reconcile being a a conservative someone who has served the Republican Party for so long has served within the Trump Administration but also feel comfortable enough to be able to ... critique this administration and the president and also deal with the blowback from those within the Trump wing of the party well\nI mean for me it never bothered me when I when Carson decided Dr Carson decided to go into HUD one I did not want him to go into\nA there were other individuals who advised him names I won't mention who did not want him to go into that either a he decided that's what he wanted to do and so we said okay well this is what he's going to do we need to try to protect him we need to try to preserve whatever's left of his legacy\nI was the youngest out of all of these people so it was decided that I should be the one to go on with him I get the political process I Know what I was going to do my best to sort of guard him protect him advise him as best possible uh so that he could at least try to stay above the fray with all the chaos that comes with the administration so from my vantage point I never saw it as\nMe working for Trump because I never like Trump when he was a candidate I never liked him without a car accident or some didn't like them even when I was there working with him careful now you're going to get in trouble but I'm I'm telling the truth for me I only saw it as here's an African American person who was once well respected and regarding the black community\nIt's odd and potentially problematic watery cops are asked if they've ever been sexually assaulted it's not clear of the questions legal what about president turkey

forecast them drive on the [noise]\nEver seen a thousand dollar bill thing anymore so even if you want a thousand dollars Monday morning point five oh five ... five point of I\n[noise]\nLook up and do you live from lives on if you're just to the and my guess right now is your micro single 'cause we're having a conversation about the intricacies of not only conservatism but\nPolitics in America and we don't necessarily fit into these neatly defined in crafted bins where every one of a certain persuasion who's right on the pile is once you think or believe a certain way or left to ensure Michael singled him as someone who has served in\nThree different presidential campaigns is served in the Trump Administration\nBut it's not necessarily I'm On board with everything the president does and before the break sure Michael I Want you to formulate a a\nAn argument I said it in support of Republicans or Democrats but then you corrected me you said you could do it for conservatism as opposed to liberalism so let's do that well\nBecause of a political party is merely a structure to\nOr be representative of said beliefs of said ... right so\nIf I Am a conservative than the idea is that I Would be a Republican because the Republican Party purports to\nBe representative of conservatism as an ideology purports writes fossil you know what it means so that's why I use that word in the same if I'm a liberal or progressive or democratic socialist if I'm On the left side of the logical spectrum then\nYou would presume that one would be a member of the Democratic party because that is a party that represents wearing bodies those beliefs\nAre but unfortunately for me I don't think the Republican Party embodies conservatism anymore or can you say anymore it's like you can't come back [noise]\nYou know I was talking to Michael Steele about this and Bill Kristol about this yesterday and\nThirty five percent of the country ... let's say thirty cars that could be off by a tutor percentages let's say thirty percent as far as thirty percent of the country supported Donald Trump voted for Donald Trump\nPresidents do come to go but when he leaves I don't think he's going to go quietly as previous presidents have I think he's going to to stay in the political fray\nWhat do you do with those people now we could potentially go the way of the wigs where you had some degree of separation where individuals left the wigs wigs died and then they started the Republican Party that we know of today\nI don't think that's going to happen because the difference during what a hundred plus fifty years ago was that you had a significant number of people who were members of that party I'm not only the elite but also common folks he's like you know I think this has to better direction\nLet me jump in there or you're a student of history if not the direction of the no nothing wigs which killed the party could it be something that we saw the Nineteen sixties I don't use the Democrats as example where they created the party to support civil rights and then you had this gives them where they left in in some became the Dixiecrats then\nFolded into the Republican so who do you have people leaving the Republican Party come to the Democrats\nYou know that something that I haven't thought about I think\nPresently no and I would say no because I Do think there is a great study that just came out in September by the Brookings Institute\nI'm On the Democratic party and in this study goes through how the Democratic party is sort of similar to the Republican Party in the midst of this paradigm shift trying to figure out\nWhat does it mean to be a liberal or progressive or democratic socialist how far left are we going to go and I think for the conservatives it would be pretty difficult to be a part of the Democratic party\nParticularly as the party moving more and more left I think the party was more centrist then I think you could find some conservatives who could try to rationalize intellectually being a member of the party but right now I don't think so so I think for those individuals who would leave the wigs\nAre relieved the Republican Party seems to those who left the waves rather I should say\nWould probably find themselves as independents or in or conservatives without a party which is the situation you see what a lot of individuals who said I've left the Republican Party I'm an independent\nI reminds me of um of a great great after American order by the name of a book or to Washington\nAnd a book or a T made a reference to the Republican Party and I'm going to probably get a little wrong but it's actually the quote was black people didn't leave the Republican Party you know the Republican partisans we love black people\nAnd I think if you ask most African Americans they're well aware that black people voted Republican years ago um but then they will say yeah that was before they became a racist party\nAnd I would agree that those sentiments are pretty legitimate and when you see what's going on with the state of the party now\nAnd I am still trying to hope that perhaps by state and I can continue to fight for things I Know is right as President Obama just said in a speech that he gave a month or two ago that it is important\nTo have to healthy parties in our country President Obama illustrated that in a an amazing speech he gave out of ... at a University in Chicago recently and I thought about that speech as I listen to it and re read it and I said you know the president former president has a good point uh the Republican Party should be able to compete\nWith just not white people they should be able to compete with African Americans with Hispanic Americans with Asian American everybody in between and so maybe there is something noble are worthy to fight for but I Do also ask myself as well candle to bother me to tell the\nTruth [noise] are you going to make a difference honestly are going to really make a difference\nBecause if thirty percent of the party as I said earlier\nHas bought into this\nIsn't this Trump ism and the populism and the nationalism for because they fear changing society because they fear that they're being marginalized et cetera can you ever really reach people who at their bases point are reacting only off of their emotions\nAnd not thinking intellectually not thinking rationally not thinking logically probably not\nSo but as it is it about trying to reach them or is it about making sure that you least have a person or people in power in other words you can elected Donald Trump you may not support Donald Trump but you can support the fact that he has two Supreme Court justices who might be more in alignment with the bigger picture you have federal judges how about that okay\nSo I agree with those things were were an individual can say well there are tangible things that I can point to that I like about him\nOkay I understand that but they're also a whole lot of other things with his character that comes that the expectation that we maintain as a country for that for anyone who maintains the officer uphold you also have the presidents and so I Would say that those individuals you can like those things\nYou can enjoy those things you can support those things\nBut in the arenas the areas where he is categorically wrong\nYou need to critique him and you need to be able to say I can support you in this aspect but I'm going to criticize the hell out of you were when you are wrong\nAnd I don't think enough Republicans are doing that let's close with this you have a new show in conjunction with Facebook tell me about it yeah so a new show that launched October fourth I Want to say it's called consider it produced by vox media that I'm hosting would a list plank who's the ... the progressive I'm the conservative\nAnd the ideal of the shows and sort of promote with millennials\nBoth sides of the argument to get them to sort of consider both aspects both perspective\nI don't think there's enough people talking to each other right now everybody's in their tribal camps and no one wants to talk\nAnd it's our hope despite our into logical difference that we can talk about complicated issues some fun issues as well and bring younger people into the conversation into the fold and and have them engage with the issues that they might not necessarily talk about what people who don't necessarily agree with them\nWith each of social media so people can find you yeah a Twitter it's a sure Michael underscore that's S. H. E. R. M. I. C. H. A. L. underscores the same for Instagram and Facebook I'm sure Michael singleton\nMy brother and my friend it's it's a pleasure to meet you finally to be able to to dialogue with you we've been going back and forth people don't know my personal Facebook page he's been getting into it works\nFolks who listen to me is that I don't like it well I don't give a damn he's coming on the program and I like anyone who comes on the program sure Michael it's a pleasure to meet you and hope to do this again I appreciate it and we would definitely do is get midterms coming up so we need to have another conversation in a few weeks [laughter]\nYes we do this is Kelly show coming through from political junkie if I Am six forty more stimulating talk now to the KFI newsroom for an update Mark Kelly here\nIt's all worth it because the bigger picture is where do we come from where we go from here\nUh we didn't need Donald Trump to get a tax cut passed or to get to Supreme Court justice has passed we had plenty of sane competent experience Republicans\nThat could have accomplished not only those things but do them in a way that was an undermining our democratic norms institutions and ideals the way that Donald Trump is and the cult of personality that's been built up\nWith Donald Trump it scares me because people have become irrational and their support for having facts don't matter the presses the enemy of the people I don't believe what you see or hear only listen to what I say I mean the parallels to like not the Arab propaganda tactics is really [noise]\nIt's scary stuff and I don't see that to be melodramatic back if people used to use Nazi references and Hitler and the shutdown of conversation but this was this is actually just historically accurate in the parallels what they're using\nAnd the tactics and it's on purpose so I get Donald Trump credit for his ability to message things in a way\nThat our simplistic enough and repetitive enough\nThat people believe them whether it's true or not you repeat ally enough and people start to believe it that is the crux of Donald Trump's entire stick and it's worked for him so yes people say well yeah we've gotten look at what we've gotten tax cuts the Supreme Court and and I say\nWe didn't need Donald Trump to do that and it's not worth it given the price of the country is paying the long term health of the republic\nNot that I expect him to change but this was just a hypothetical if Donald Trump or to stop tweeting if Donald Trump or to stop the name calling if he were stopped doing the things which really rankled the nerves of people on both sides of the aisle would you be more accepting of him\n[noise] well [noise] yes and no\nI mean on for some of the things like I I'm actually a pretty I'm pretty hawkish when it comes to illegal immigration and border security I worked on that issue on Capitol Hill for seven years I help advocate for two border patrol agents who were unjustly convicted and and in prison for a shooting incident with an illegal alien Drug Smuggler in Texas\nSo I became pretty hawkish on the on the border security issue and I happen to agree with a lot of of Trump's policies on immigration not locking kids in cages that's that's too much but the enforcement and the fact that we needed there things need to change our system is broken\nAnd I think that that was a big issue for him\nUm and partially why people voted for him but I think they came from a perspective more um xenophobia and not wanting the demographics of this country to change as opposed to coming
