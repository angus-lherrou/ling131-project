station\nWe're taking telephone calls here on the recovery and show off the Charlotte Hi Marilyn shuts on the phone welcome to the program shut how are you\nI Am great Rick thank you very much how can I average several your books and uh watch listen to your show for years and I guess my question is now that I'm Seventy three\nAnd had been taken his are empty requirement or how should I take that I've been taking at an annual basis in December should it be taken a monthly yearly a percentage or I kind of like a a thought of a reverse a dollar cost averaging method\nThat's exactly what you're doing that's exactly right so let me back up and let everybody know what we're talking about here\nIf you have a retirement account such as an IRA or a retirement account at work like a four O. one K. or for three baby or the first savings plan is a federal employee if you have any kind of these retirement accounts starting at age Seventy and a half you have to begin making withdrawals out of the account\nNow the rules are very complicated in technical in terms of when you have to start\nA and how much you have to withdraw and which account you must make withdrawals from if you don't follow the rules very carefully you could not only encourage taxes but you also encourage penalties of as much as fifty percent\nOf what you were supposed to have withdrawn but didn't so you've got to make sure you get it right but here's the point once you do start to make these withdrawals\nThese are called required minimum distributions the IRS tells you how much you must withdraw there is a minimum amount you must withdraw\nAnd it's required hence the name are empty required minimum distribution\nWhen you begin to do it you have a choice\nYou can take the money is a single lump sum once a year or you can take the money during the year whenever you feel like it or you can do it systematically such as taking the same amount of money every month like clockwork so you get a monthly check out of your account just like you would get a Social Security check\nIt doesn't really matter Chet how you do it provided\nYou do it consistently in other words if you're going to receive a monthly check every December which you said your doing fine go ahead and do that your dollar cost averaging in reverse you're making withdrawal every December and you'll do that for the rest of your life if you want her to do it\nOn a more frequent basis instead of one check once a year you take twelve checks once a month that's fine to do it however you wish just make sure that whatever you choose you maintain on a consistent basis that's how you'll generate the best value\nFrom a reverse dollar cost averaging perspective this way you'll get the average cost of the withdrawals based on the values of the count at the time what I'm more concerned about\nIs not so much whether you do it once a year or once a month I I'm really not worried about that so much the difference isn't that huge the bigger concern I have\nIs whether you're doing it in conforming ... with the IRS rules as I mentioned if you don't do it correctly you could pay a fifty percent penalty\nAnd what do I mean by doing it correctly well if you have multiple retirement accounts which most people do they've got an IRA\nMaybe his name and other IRA and her name the guide retirement accounts from several multiple employers in the past\nThe IRS generally says we only care about the total dollar value of the accounts but we separately care if any of those accounts\nWere for a one case in other words you can't take money from an IRA that was meant to be withdrawn from a four O. one K. even though you might have taken the proper amount failing to take it from the proper account\nCreates the penalty problem here's another concern the IRS calculation is not based on the date of the withdrawal this is a big mistake that people often make especially if you're withdrawing the money\nOnce every month the IRS doesn't face the calculation on when you withdraw the money they base the calculation on the value of the account on the prior December thirty one\nSo based on that you might accidentally withdraw two little\nBased on last year's market values\nConversely you could accidentally withdraw too much more than is necessary causing you to pay taxes unnecessarily so the calculations are complicated\nThe rules are cumbersome and the penalties for ever are usually not only severe but they are on yielding meaning if you try to complain to the tax court\nYour love most likely going to lose that case\nSo we strongly encourage you to work with a financial advisor and attacks advisor\nNot only to make sure the calculations are correct but so that if there is a mistake you're advisor will alone that liability instead of you because you can hold your advisor responsible for negligence or ... or omissions\nAnd a reputable advisor will certainly stand behind their advice to say oh we told you to do it we were wrong we will make you whole not for the taxes you have to pay those but for any interest or penalties that you may incur\nSo be careful make sure you get it right don't mess around when it comes to withdrawals out of your account\nSo that sounds good Rick and and we do only have two accounts and uh I Do coordinate with my account so good we make sure they know the amount is right I always take out an extra two dollars [laughter]\nVery clever so chat I'm Glad you got it on the money I'm Glad you're on the ball there I Wish everybody else was to say thanks very much for your call\nWell You're welcome have a great day\nDue to a that was Jeff from uh Charlotte hold Marilyn if you have concerns or questions or confusion about your retirement accounts and the required minimum distributions and you're approaching eight Seventy and you haven't the gun withdrawing money yet\nGive us a call triple late plan wreck let's make sure we get this right and let's make sure we tend to this much sooner than the deadline oh by the way you want to hear another way that people make mistakes\nThey know they have to withdraw their money by age seven eight and a half so they withdraw the money in the year that they've turned Seventy but they haven't yet reached age Seventy and a half guess what\nReal draw doesn't count so you can I talk about the complexity of the rules quite frankly it's a whole thing's a a set up the rules are so complicated they're designed to trick you and trap you\nEnabling the IRS to nail you with penalties these rules could be made so much simpler so much easier so much more fair\nThat would eliminate the need for the complexity which does no useful purpose for anyone other than to frankly provide job security for accountants I'm Rick Edelman now's the
