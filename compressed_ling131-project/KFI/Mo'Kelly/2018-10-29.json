wife was a obviously are ideal\nIn the dreamer in real life in real life okay when was that\nA bucket around eighty five okay but I and I and I vote when you um\nSplit up or you are supposed to um try to talk things out you know get\nThings back together ... a shoe started dating and then the other man right off the bat no oh that must have been all I wanted to be with her again\nAnd I'm I'm\nIn my dreams and never dreamed that I've had over ... she's always left me or she's always\nTune time name ... boy I\nTruly of no trust in the women and um I mean my point in life I doubt very much of Oliver oh go with another woman\nOh Marco I've seen eighty five year old son tend to trust me uh let me just say this first of all what happened\nTo you and your divorce was undeniably one of the most painful traumatic events of your life\nBut I don't believe it started there\nWhat I Know about attachment theory is that our early life attachment mechanisms get replayed over and over in in our adult life in other words we keep returning to the scene of the crime until we work out this conflict\nSo my suspicion is that you had an abandoning very very early in life and an some unconscious level when you met her I hate to say we kinda know what we're going to get\nYou knew this wouldn't work out and so she has now become a metaphor\nFor feelings of loss\nAnd I really highly suggest that you seek out a good empathetic therapist who can help you work with this feeling of loss because if this dream is coming up a lot Marco this is something you are meant to deal with because I Believe\nThat you can heal and attachment injury at any stage of the lifespan and I want you to believe it too so you can make that change\nThank you so much for calling I'm so sorry I have to be brief and I know it's very sensitive to thank you for waiting for so long Marco\nOkay Mandy Hi Mandy it's Dr Wendy Mandy are you there yeah tell me about your dream it's Dr Wendy\nWhen I was younger I had a dream about tornado mhm all the time maybe six seven eight nine times always a tornado and I was always in the process of\nTrying to stay and trying to cover for safety\nUm I my mother was extremely is ... and\nShe was it's really not a good person to me uh two my my father ... anyway and lately I've been having a terrain\nWarren intimate the I just recently the lord my husband ... and because I felt\nYou know it was more of a friend mhm anyway and\nI had the warm feeling in my hearing a lot lately\nAnd inhumane like intimacy sexual dreams or emotion\nWell OK then I wake up and of course I'm Alone [laughter]\nSo okay so let me tell you this man first of all in the soft warm intimacy dreams what would be the strongest feeling that you can describe that goes along with that dream\nCloseness I I'm ... and and and a good feeling\nNice All right so let me explain this um you mentioned that you just went through a divorce and yet you're having these really positive dreams\nHere's the thing about the brain when we're deprived of something when I mentioned before that wanting is a stronger emotion than having they've actually done research on people that they deliberately starved they put them on super low low calorie diet and they found out\nThat all they do is think and talk about food and exchange recipes and think about preparing food we become obsessed with what we don't have\nAnd so the good news about this is rather than you stuck in a place of longing where your dreams have a lot of distress in them and a lot of feelings of loss your dream seems to be looking towards the future and what's coming to you\nSo I really think you can create this Mandy I'm feeling really good things about this particular dream so I Want to say dream on and also get on a dating app because you're drinking ... become a reality Mandy thank you very much very closely with very little time we have Dina Dina it's Dr Wendy\nHow what's your dream\nUm I have lots of recurring theme but the one I wanted to ask about that you know a lot of my dream I can love taped or I can meditate and fly\nOh I Love those dreams I don't get to have them very often about um like three times in my life but I Love them or what is the feeling that you get though is this a scary experience\nOn well normally and and I and my normal life I Am afraid of heights or you know they make me really nervous\nBut in my dreams you know it's it's like I I look forward to bloom now and we're like I can [noise] you know I don't have the power to and and and uh lift my head up in ... and take a deep breath and then I slowly propelling myself up for it and\nI can fly around and you know the sunsets and\nAnd uh or just feel comfortable I you know it's still really comfortable and I don't know some are somehow some readers very [noise] um I have a feeling um\nHey\nBeautiful do you know what a beautiful dream to end my show on thank you for bringing me that dream and\nI think he analyzed it yourself this is where

in place to make sure that they were ... armored that they were more protected this is not that conversations not any of those conversations\nIs the fact that we as Americans are dealing with something that no other country has to deal with yesterday was the worst mass shooting or incident of death regarding anti Semitism in the history of this country\nIn the history of this country and you know what it probably won't be the dominant new story seven days from now after all the funerals have been conducted what does this say about America and let me get to the shooter\nHe went in there and basically mowed down people an average age of sixty five an older senior citizens\nFrom top to bottom he was so filled with hate in his heart hated Jewish people that he felt it was necessary to taking a are Fifteen and gun down senior citizens while they were worshipping\nAnd then have the dirty nerve to open fire on law enforcement and then have to double dirty nerve to even\nTo even lay down his gun and surrender you mean survivor yeah yeah\nHe was given the opportunity he had the chance to surrender in live now barring suicide he probably will live up the rest of his life and Pennsylvania does have the death penalty but how many years from now and trials along the way is that how many appeals before he would actually be put to death\nHe probably is going to live out the rest of his life\nI'll be behind bars but that's more than I can say for eleven people that he killed\n... who are not in any way of doing anything to him who are not a threat in in any way most of them two older rung no Israeli really tragic and if I were Ninety seven years old I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have run I probably would have steered the gunman in the face run to wear for

there is a third option when they say it's fight or flight if I'm Ninety seven years old from eighty something years old it's probably needs are at that point it's neither is the guy with an A R Fifteen who's mowing down people\nNo I'm not going to fight probably because there's too much distance in between me and the gunman probably\nI'm probably not going to be able to run anywhere probably and if there's someone I care about such as this situation where you had a even a husband and wife where you have brothers\nYou're not leaving you're not running is nothing for you to do but but the real point is this it seems like if I may have it wrong and I'm quite sure you'll let me know because you often think I'm wrong\nIt seems like we're at a point in America where the politics are far more important than the actual people\nThat we in America don't really care that someone died we only care in relation to who the shooter was which demographic the shooter represents which demographic died in the process and then we will assess blame or value\nTo both the shooter and\nThe victims because it's a very different conversation if the shooter were Muslim a very different conversation and

half way\nThey talk about Google for a second Google has fired forty eight people it seems over sexual misconduct claims what the hell is\nGoing on in Silicon valley these days in just the last two years forty eight people\nCan you imagine what a typical dead at Google must be like forty eight people in the past two years had been fired in other words\nThey there have been claims there was an investigation and all those mother father said you gotta go gotta do\nThis at the same Silicon Valley where we reported that they were trying to give them low doses of acid to promote creativity okay swung mission Thirteen\nSenior managers were among those dismissed Google said that it\nTook a quote unquote increasingly hard line on misconduct by senior managers and offered employees avenues to report harassment anonymously and I always say like a Roach theory\nIf all this was reported and followed up on and these people were fired what about the people who didn't report what about all the unreported incidents which probably proceeded this change in policy at Google\nOh yeah yeah [noise]\nBut it is no different than a there was another story you had yeah let's go to Netflix\nNetflix and it's not necessarily necessarily sexual harassment but Netflix has its own set of issues if you've ever read like lord of the flies or you watch survivor that's the the work environment at Netflix they have this program where employees can re each other\nAnd you have managers lobby to either keep or fire employees in the managers are like in competition with each other with headquarters in northern California or Netflix\nUsually pays its employee somewhere in the high five and six figure range more than Seventy current and former employees talked to the wall Street Journal about the culture that Netflix prides itself on\nAnd it's prides itself on what is called the key protest the key protests has become the mantra for when it comes to foreign people at Netflix managers must constantly ask themselves whether they would fight to keep an employee\nLike physically fight ... well ... that's ... that's not right but it's a strategy they say that many employer employee said had them constantly in fear of losing their jobs while managers feared not firing people because it made them look soft\nFear not firing people wow what'd you want to work there hell no hell no if the impetus is to fire people\nAnd why in the world would you want to work there what would you want to be a manager there if you have to fight to keep your employees or demonstrate I understand everyone has to employee review I understand the need to to demonstrate your value to accompany the need to show that you\nHave a a a usable skill that is good for the company but if you're trying to put employees in competition with each other\nI can only have a bad out and also like inquire\nWe'd like what you want what you would you fight them would you would you take one to them\n... put his way this seems like it's a law suit or many law suits waiting to happen it just seems like when you have competition between employees and you're not necessarily being fired on the\nMerits you're making it a competition where\nManagers are encouraged to fire people I'm surprised it depends on what type of nondisclosure agreement they've had to sign or what way where they had to sign what they had to give away offer up as far as not being able to sue because that just seems like it would be open yourself up to all sorts of litigation because he would not be for cause\nSeemingly everyone would have to be like an at will employee\nWhich company would you rather work for the company ... with their sexual ... the weather's fight Google\nAnd I would rather work at school because that to me is is more of a normal life environment I Know what to expect I kind of know the parameters of what to do what not to do as far as how to avoid sexual harassment that makes more sense but if my job is somehow\nA connected to managers in competition with each other\nBecause one manager wants to keep his or her employees as opposed to my manager then is outside of my control and it's less about my job performance and more about something which has nothing to do with me I Would much rather work at Google\nIt's almost like the the the fighting a scenario is trying to weed out the normal people and they want the sociopath you've heard the CEOs are often see sociopath maybe that's what they're looking for\nObviously yeah it's a statement about culture they're looking for a certain culture and ... and for me that doesn't work for me now I'm forty eight years old if you're asking me a twenty four and I'm I'm trying to move up in the company and I'm much more cutthroat\nAnd I have fewer things to worry about in other words like I don't have a wife I don't have kids and it's just about my own desires to move up then yeah then I may be more open to that type of cutthroat environment because in many ways if you know anything about the music industry it can be like that but it wasn't formalized in the sense where\nManagers were told and also encouraged to engage in this type of behavior right right now uh I'd much rather work at Google you know and if someone hits on me that I'm just getting fired back if I Am six forty more stimulating talk next month and\nA judge has ruled
