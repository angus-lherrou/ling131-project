I was gonna say particularly females involved in a couple but husbands too and I want to talk about date night and I want to admit something\nI used to think that date night was a big waste of time you know I couldn't really find a scientific research on it it seemed to be this kind of fake\nPut something on the calendar and let's go out with you know the person who's pretty much see new wearing sweats and are looking to drag it with the baby poop on you and now you're going to like suddenly get dressed up and pretend to be someone else and then you're gonna get out there and you can remember the last fight that you had together and are\nYou going to talk about the schedule again where the kids have to be when and why isn't the other partner helping out more and then you come home and you're just tired and you think there was a waste we spent all that money went to that show where he went to dinner and\nGet all dressed up and for what right and then the pressure to have sex after and maybe you're in that stage of your relationship where there's a high desire low desire dynamics\nSo one rushes to try to get to sleep before the other end so I thought to myself I used to think you know it's not it's it's not really solving the problem that people want solved which is how to get back into relationships how to get back into love\nBut I started thinking about it more and more and more and then I started reading more and more about the research on it\nAnd I admit that I have changed my stance and you're going to hear it right now\nHere's what I Do know is that couples who last the longest maintain kind of romantic fantasy about their relationship they think of their partner\nIn high self esteem and they remind their partner why they love them\nYou know when you complement your partner you know you're actually reminding your own brain of while you're there and why you fell in love [noise] so I have a new take on date night and I believe date night is very very important however it must be done in a certain way to achieve the results that you want to achieve\nAnd I think that if the\nOutcome for both of you is to make love afterwards then that can be the goal so don't drink too much alcohol to sponsor that in their ah but\nI think that date nights actually works best when you can be the fantasy person\nThat you're you know spouse fell in love with it we'll pretend to be somebody else on for states and we want to go back into that fantasy to kind of a rouse all the feelings that we had back then\nAnd even if you don't want to go I Want you to make the effort I'm telling husbands and wives husbands and husbands wives and wise and telling partners to make the effort and show up to the occasion\nActually talking to a woman this week and same thing you know they had a bunch of kids and three kids\nAnd they retired and she's like a friday night's gonna come and we have the babysitter scheduled and I know I'm so tired I'd rather just got to stay in take a bath or just watch a movie at home or just so tired\nAnd I said to her new now you need to shave your legs and buy a new pair of underwear and remember who you were remember who you were and I want to tell both partners that if you were in what is called the ...

talked about issues more locally we talked about the house races\nI made the prediction that I expect the Democrats to take back the house I'm using history as a guide and what I Know personally I don't expect him to have any shot at the Senate\nOr the or given about a one in five chance\nBut it would be more accurate if ... wanted three okay let me explain why this is there are five races that are really really hard to figure out by traditional means in North Dakota Missouri\nTexas Tennessee in Nevada those five are really hard to figure out because\nPolling is all over the place\nUh in Texas you were dealing with a very unusual volatile situation\nAnd in North Dakota if history is any indicator the polls were way off in the last senatorial race up there when Heitkamp was as the Democratic incumbent was running against Bergen bird was up a dozen points according to polls a week before the election Heitkamp want\nIt all depends in North Dakota on a couple of things\nA turnout among Native Americans and how much loyalty the voters of North Dakota have to the fracking industry which is starting to have gone past its peak in that state and has done some damage to the environment up there so it doesn't carry the gravity that did it did a few years ago\nThe president has been taking multiple victory lap so I'm not saying that he hasn't on them I Would have advised against them right this time going into the midterms right I'm I'm quite sure the Democrats will have a very long memory of this moment right if the Democrats take back the house what might we expect in response\nYou will see people that were able to avoid nonexistent subpoenas getting actual subpoenas to appear in front of Congress\nYou will see my Congressman Adam Schiff on the news considerably you will have linked the hearings mostly relating I Do believe to the abuse of the moments clause\nOkay how much is the president enriching himself and his family at the public ... public suspense when Paul Ryan was running Congress this was not an issue because Republicans controlled all the committee's they do not control all the committee now\nThat's of course what happens in a congressional yeah but we also know that a Bob Mueller has been exceedingly quiet I speak\nConsciously yeah because he did not want to disrupt the political process trip we know that um they will be some sentencing in December right\nAnd I suspect that if there's going to be another shoe to drop the shoes will be dropping around December\nAs well it is said that ah of the eight charges that weren't decided in the first Manafort trial that they may retrial all I excuse me the ten of the a team that they may reach try him on all ten of them are which means that talks between Manafort Muller probably stalled\nThere there there's a point that they are not congruent desserts an issue\nDoes that is that better news for the ... better news for anyone who might have something to hide it's not good\nNews for Paul Manafort [laughter] uh\nI remember once the information you know ultimately he wants\nYou know I I Am after the big fish are you going to hand him to me or not come on let's go to cut through the crap that's why this whole thing exists\nYou know it it is true that a picking off the Roger Stone in the Carter pages and the Paul Manafort and maybe even the Steve Bannon's is something but ultimately what they want to determine is does the government\nHave or does the Justice Department have a strong enough case against Donald Trump for conspiring with Russian help that he was aware of and two thousand sixteen they want to know if there's a strong enough case against him\nLifts propose or suppose for a moment yes a democratic doomsday in other words the worst happens hum\nThe Democrats do not take back the house or the Senate right and lower does not have enough to charge or will not pursue any type of charges of President Trump as it relates to obstruction or in Russian quote unquote conspiracies illusion right what do you think happens to this country then\nNothing as it continues as it was before the idea that there's some kind of magic bullet that happens if there's a split government if if the Democrats take the house or the house in the Senate or Mueller has some smoking gun uh I ... I think that\nPresident Trump is safe\nAs president for the next two years no matter how the Democrats race they simply they are never going to get sixty seven votes in the Senate to convict and remove him for one\nFor two he's the gift that keeps on giving as far as Democrats are concerned look the fact of the matter is is what we saw last week in the financial markets if that continues into two thousand to the Nineteen two thousand twenty\nIt's if you think there's a blue wave coming in a few weeks there will be a blue Sana'a being twenty twenty if there is a recession or a stock market crashed between today and and election day twenty twenty\nHalf of Donald Trump's support disappears at that point the Republican Party turns its back on it you know you have damage us okay so in fact if we have a a serious enough recession or stock market crash before then he will be primary day out\nI was speaking to a friend on Facebook actually a colleague of ours I'm not going to mess up mentioned the person's name but that person was saying how can you not reelected president ... twenty twenty a given the status of the economy now and my point is\nOh well there's there's no real reason for me to believe that the stock market is going to be progressing in a positive point for the next two years now it's\nEver seen a thousand dollar bill fall thing anymore so you won't even if you want a thousand dollars Monday morning ... five oh five five point one jail by station [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nKFI aims to forty more stimulated he's off of the ... show flips off gaming did you have any idea fed again like marvel Spiderman\nGame which has met a credit rating of eighty seven out of a hundred I G n rating of eight point seven out of ten okay maybe that doesn't make any sense to you what if I told you it sold three point three million copies of the game within the first three days that\nComes to about ... about two hundred million dollars of revenue in three days\nThat fundamentally changes the industry of what we know as far as how games are played who makes them in who purchase system joining right now is miles from its just miles who has his own YouTube channel talking about things just like this he's joining us to break it down miles how are you and what the hell is going on in the gaming world\nI'm great how are you doing All right not a bad job to help and the game world of having some big changes with the coming of games like sport night the rebirth of call of duty now and the marvel universe taking its stab at the game world once again\nWhen you say taking a stab at the getting real once again what change or what has evolved in the past couple of years\nSo taking Spiderman for an example I remember\nBack in two thousand sat Spiderman three came out and this was supposed to be ... as far as Spiderman goes as in terms of movies ... yes in terms of this other Spiderman three movie came out and then the Spiderman three game came out so you could go see the movie and the same day pick up the gang mhm so we picked it up and\nThe ... in general is so fluid\nAnd it seemed like okay I'm controlling it the same way that it happened in the movies\nBut looking at it now from this Spider Man it's like first off graphically why was I thinking that this was top of the line well it was ... years ago correct but who would have thought that it could come to this point okay this game is for K. quality\nAnd the movement is just excellent and almost seems like\nYou're casting Tom Hall in to do this and do all these movements in the stunt coordinators day it's almost like you're on set with it\nSo it feels lifelike movie like we are using actual pictures of people as opposed to a role play gate correct\nWhat has been the response I gave some of the the critical response is some of the sales responses books what has been some responses that you've heard from just people in your peer group or people who you game with in terms of this game and other games in ...\nThis so we talked about this my friend group and we said this is the start of marvel pushing forward this a cinematic universe but in the video game world\nSo we might get another eyeing van game we might get a hold of Ender's Game we saw a another company square the next day released a fifty second clip\nOf the Avengers project we didn't see any game play we only saw a hammer sunglasses and captain America's shield so\nIt looked good isn't for K. quality but we're not sure we're going to expect from this one I think it's going to drop after ... the\nThe next uh Avengers movie and it's going to sell out even more than Spider Man did\nWould seem to me and I didn't study math\nIn college but it would seem to me if you can drop a game and make two hundred million in three days\nAnd unless the game cost as much as it would cost to make a Spider Man movie it would seem like it in terms of a multiplier the gaming industry would be much more profitable than the cinematic industry not that you can do the games without the movies the movies propelled the games I'm I'm not stupid you know you need one for the\nRight but it seems like from a business standpoint the games have more of an upside in a financial since then the movies at this point correct because you go to movies often how much do movies cost generally anywhere between ten and twenty dollars a ticket absolutely\nSpiderman started selling ... around sixty dollars to eighty dollars plus the downloadable\nContent that you add on to it so if you find that okay so I'm going to play this game is going to cost me sixty to eighty just to get the gang mhm now I I'm quite sure you talking about the endgame purchases ... some of those things be\nSo you buy basic Spiderman you get game from point a to point B this could be the downloadable content the endgame purchases it'd be more suits more abilities or more missions if you've already beat the game a hundred percent\nOh wow what might that cost me as a just a dollar Ninety nine here or is it something that is I'm going to keep paying in perpetuity is there a feeling to what I might pay\nThis is a really cool trick the businesses do they have but they called a season pass us even pass older you get you pay I Believe it's fifty nine Ninety nine the whole nother price of the game for all these downloadable packs you get everything that'll come out so\nEach pack will probably be about anywhere from Fifteen twenty dollars you buy all those tax or you could pay for that one time fee and sometimes they're small prints to where you don't get all the facts and you get some of the tax and some extra coins here and there for an game stuff you've\nGot to be kidding me oh the gaming industry is doing it right now okay this is you talked about how marvel is doing was Spiderman what are some of the other things in trends that you're seeing as far as these games as far as how they're sold how they're being promoted how they're being marketed to maximize their revenue potential\nLet's talk about one of the biggest names currently in gaming for now\nYou can't be an adult and not have heard of Fort Night if you have a child\nI've heard of it I've never played it right so kids will beg their parents for money the product isn't something that'll promote you envy festival in the game it's not something that ... better you in your experience it's just cosmetic it's just it's getting\nClose just close that's it\nYou're literally buying virtual ... literally bind virtual closed for real close prices that's madness Oh yes this genius in marketing standpoint but\nIt's madness to think that okay it does it have an expiration date once you buy it you can only use it for a certain amount of time or I assume when the next game comes to buy a whole new set of clothes\nSo this is the way this is where for night has to taking the gaming industry by storm it costs absolutely nothing to play Fortnite barebones I play Fortnite here and there I have zero scans I'm not falling for it but people drop hundreds and thousands of dollars on his game\nOh mine and they have
