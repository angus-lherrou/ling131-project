E. N. S.\nAnd you know hands is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance of sport is pretty much everything right so\nIt is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in in assets that they want to leave behind to they're greedy and washed undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest to you if they're real estate or something like that\nSo talk to your ah financial people talk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff but I think it's something for you to consider\nWell\nDorothy I've got something else that's two wonderful to be true and that is that if anyone listening to the show right now would like to talk to want to buy our financial advisors about their estate planning their retirement planning then you know what go to our website is money matters dot net\nAnd on that website you'll have a link there and you can click on it which says I Want to sign up for the next seminar and you can do that and when you're there\nDorothy guess what people will get they will get are now world famous oatmeal raisin and chocolate chunks cookies\nAnd folks did you notice I said chocolate chunks I did not say chip you don't want chocolate chip tips made with ... they form and they formed the chocolate with wax it's gross you weren't real chocolate chocolate chunks\nYou want chocolate that melts all over your face gets on your clothes on your notes and everybody's looking at you like what the heck's wrong with you don't you know how to eat a cookie and you're like no or do you look at our trumpet chunk\nAnd while you're at it you're learning about your finances man it's a deal you can find nowhere else to go to our website money matters a net now on the off chance that maybe cookies or not what you want to go to us that are for although I Would highly recommend it at the semi we're going to talk about three of the worst enemies you have to your financial well being we're going to talk about inflation you'd have to talk about income taxes\nBarry markets we'll also talk about how to calculate your magic number which is a if you have enough money to retire on\nWe're going to talk about your cash flow man and maximizing cash flow junior retirement we'll talk about what you should be doing with your four one K. right now we'll talk about when you should take Social Security when you're sixty two sixty six when you're Seventy we're going to talk about the fact that the IRS [noise]\nYeah those guys they want a tax eighty five\nPercent of your Social Security benefits and we know show you how to beat that if it's at all possible we have so much information at the center I Can't even tell you all about it right now but go to our website money matters dot net sign up for the seminar and we'll look forward to seeing you there you know what I can not believe how fast the show has\nOn its over already I Hope you guys enjoyed it as much as I enjoy doing it for you will see you next week same time same channel by by everybody this is KFI am six forty\n[noise]\nInformation presented should not be regarded as a complete analysis on a Sunday ends and not be construed as an offer to buy or sell any of the security has mentioned none of this show's content viewed as personalized investment my\nProfessional advisor Cindy ... more implementing any of the strategies presented every time I've been involved with varying degrees of rent and therefore it can be no insurance any ... invented the first strategy will be more profitable for a client or fully\nPlanning information armored on this program is general in nature always insolvent attorney or regarding years that they make legal ... founded ... should not be construed as\nAn endorsement of rape or N.

president Chris by Iraqis as prop one could help fifty thousand families and veterans finally realized that dream\nThat changes things for a family and and I'm I'm proud to work for an organization that that does that on a daily basis and and I think this proposition is a is a chance for us to start heading that direction and state to ah to start giving that opportunity to others\nThere are exceptions if you try to stick a finger in the eye of the opposition party or or news reporters then you're going to be viewed differently we remember when first lady Hillary Clinton talked about the vast right wing conspiracy\nThat was a moment in which the perception of Hillary Clinton the first lady began to change and many people hold onto that even today\nBut generally if you stay away from poking the media or poking the opposition party you is the first lady pretty much the old view you in a political like\nFirst lady Melania Trump sat down with ABC News and I have to give her credit for doing so once you sat down with Fox News she sat down with ABC News and conducted a real interview she didn't put the parameters on it and I thought that for the most part not completely I'll get into it but for the most\nPart she was a front and forthright but there's some things I have to quibble with summer for answers and if you're like me you were wondering what that does the first lady feel about\nHer husband in the sense of his alleged wink wink infidelity what does she feel about how he conducts himself in relation to other women and this was what she had to say\nYou did agree to this interview to your credit with no preconditions knowing that there could be some some tough questions asked and it has been a tough year for you personally you're not the first first lady to how to deal with her husband's alleged infidelity is has put a strain on your marriage\nIt is not concern and focus on mine my there in the first lady\nI have much more important thing to think about them to do really\nI Know people like to speculate and media likes to speculate about our marriage and um I played the gossip but I understand the gossip has whose faith magazines [noise] getting advertising on unfortunate the relief I in this kind of world today\nMedia or these speculating yeah it's it's not always pleasant of course [noise]\nBut um I Know what he's right like in a kind of like true or not true\nIf you tell me that your marriage or the concerns about infidelity or not\nOne of your main focuses I I'm I'm not so sure that I can swallow that I'm not so sure that I can believe that because if you're in a marriage and it's a legitimate marriage that will always be an issue of concern and it's a little bit disingenuous to say that it's the media speculating with we talk about stormy game as we talk about Karen McDougal\nAnd these are legal cases which are going on these are women who were going on TV said\nYes I slept with your husband while he\nWas your husband\nI'm willing to believe that if she loves her husband as in Milan Detroit loves her husband then yes she probably has a feeling about that I don't think she's really being forthright yeah we have an honest conversation here and if she wants to blame the media is far speculation well that's just not true\nJust come on now Donald Trump or talking about he sings a porn stars in play dates he did so before he met Maloney Trump he cheated on his previous wives before he met belong your truck\nAnd I guess in that respect she can say that she doesn't care because she knew about that about him before they got married maybe that's what she's saying well let's move on there was a lot made of her I don't care jak I don't really care jak do you\nAnd the media did speculate as to what it meant well I mean Trump put all that to rest and made it very clear in terms of why she wore the jacket and the message she was trying to send\n... to Jack had to go on to planes and off the plane [noise] and it was for it to people and for the left wing media who are criticizing me and I want to show them that I don't care you could pretty decides whether you want to say that people not stop me to do but that hated tried\nWas it that that compels you to wear that at that moment because you were down there you had just been with children and then you put the jacket on\nAfter the visit that put it back on because I seen how media got obsessed about it\nRemember that was Milan ... wearing a jacket when she went to see the kids at the border who were in in cages or behind fences you know that debate\nRemember she put that jacket on by herself at that time she was receiving all sorts of of praise for going to see the kids\nBut now she's saying she put on the jacket specifically to poke at the left wing media she said she was trying to send a message so I don't know about you but I remember when she said in a different interview just a week prior to that\nShe said focused on what I Do but not what I wear\nLaid down but I Do what we're doing with that he would have had\nBut I Do have and I we focus on what I Do not laugh\nBut you wore the jacket to send a message and nobody was talking about a jacket until you put on the jacket and you put on the jacket which have specific message that you're trying to send to the left wing\nMedia your words while you were being praised for visiting children at the border for the most part the general public in the media will leave alone the first lady until she starts trying to poke a finger in the eye of the media or\nOpposition party here's how I Believe that she loves her husband because they both think they're the biggest victims in the world is fat Maloney Trump our first ladies thinks that she is the most bully person on the face of the year\n[noise] what happened to you personally or what did you see personally that you thought you were to tackle this issue I could say I'm the most bully person on the world was bullied personal ... one of\nThem if you really see what people are saying about that's why I you know my best and yesterday focusing on a personal yeah\nYou can't have a social media focus anti bullying campaign if you're not willing to address the actions\nOf your husband who happens to be one of the biggest social media bullies in the world there's a correlation\nThis is the most Kelly she okay if I Am six forty more stimulating talk I really didn't want to talk about it I really didn't want to mention county west names but damn and I'm going to have to do it when we come back much faith and
