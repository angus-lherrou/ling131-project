{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "And a ... a recently named the more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors now for the seven\nYear in a row\nAnd without our clients I Would be no aware and so I put that one on them I gave it to my client well this is a part of the show where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor now this week we're actually going to talk about paying for college\nAnd the gift tax laws so if you were not aware a gift taxes come do if you give anybody more than Fifteen thousand dollars in one year okay [noise] and ah so that's the gift tax and college in many cases is more than fifty thousand\nDollars a year I Know I have one in college right now and so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak and you know I\n\nWould always say you you\nMay be and\nI knew him\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes in probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite is designed to take you from riches to rags\nAnd we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education up paying for that okay so as I mentioned the gift tax exemption\nIs Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS [laughter]\nAll Scott you off guard on that one when the IRS\nCame up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon your death and it goes to whoever a man they want it attacks that so they created the estate tax\nBut the IRS has a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax that happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to give it all away first and then when they die there's no tax so we can't have that that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid so they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we're going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that\nBut they also realized that if you tax\nEvery single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with with friends or something that's a gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so it get kind of onerous and they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars per person that you can give to\nAnd as a married couple you can give thirty thousand dollars to as many people as you said the gift tax exempt amount that fifty thousand is you can get that too many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that gift tax\nAnd then by the way if you exceed that Fifteen thousand a gift tax is the same as your state tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not to pay taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student\nAnd then have them pay it you pay the institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have it goes through the child then that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore doesn't count\nSo my advice to you is don't give the child the money now I'll give you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college\nI'm In my fraternity there was this guy called Scott\nAnd his parents were giving him the money\nTo sensibly pay for the tuition guess what Scott was doing\nHe wasn't paying the tuition [laughter] he was keeping the money and he used to come down every day and like he had this Chinese ...\nYou know what this does sat in ... and he'd come down in that and he looked like and slept all night he'd wake up in time to watch the gong show remembers that buried the was that guys they bury something who did the gong show\nHe would wake up in time to watch the show on television and then you know you'd have lunch and he lays around all day spending his tuition money\nSo if you needed another reason not to give your child the tuition money it's that [laughter] anyway\nAs I mentioned we are from that uh we uh we special we specialize in retirement planning that's what we do so we we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are
