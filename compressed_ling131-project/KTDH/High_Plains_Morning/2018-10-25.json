everybody remembers that I think that we do is in addition to putting on these fabulous concerts we'd do a lot of outrage so we do stuff with kids\nFrom kindergarten through college um some of them are music students some of them aren't we do stuff with um elder care we go out to some of the a retirement home and play for people who can't get out to a concert really anymore and um and so that's a really important part of what we do too and like this fundraiser that Saturday\nHelp support both the concerts and is that outrage into the community so um I Would like to remind people you know were important part of the community because of this amazing talent that we bring in and that we display locally but also because you know we're helping promote music from the very young to the very old\nNot to mention a platform for um education you've got all the Suzuki students coming in and they're able to work very closely and intimately with ah all of the renowned musician that are located in this region\nWell this is Vicky kids but also we do orchestra kids that get ... wells and I'm ... and we want to expand that and they're working with these top cheer musicians as well I mean we're musicians who played you know royal Albert hall or you know the Lincoln Center and things like that and then they'll come in and work with these under privileged kids\nAnd we really want to to show them that music is an option in their lives um as they go forward whether that's a for their\nTheir um hobby or whether that's for their occupation um but whatever it is it this is something that they may not have seen a lot in their personal lives but we want them to really experience it and to experience the best of it\nYeah well that's fantastic and I know everyone across the high plains we've
