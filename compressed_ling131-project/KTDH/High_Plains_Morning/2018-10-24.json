P. P. ours radio read her book club as a discussion leader and one time when I was recording some commentaries for that program in Garden City salary Smith and uh a couple of the others there at the station like Angie have fully\nAnd Steven Johnson uh we're in there and and Valerie just said well you don't do anything else I really enjoy your features and is there anything else that that you know that you have written and I said I'm not sure I I didn't bring anything with me but ah\nI'm I Do a quite a bit of writing actually and\nI happened to have my laptop out in the car and I remember that I had been writing some humorous essays which were not intended for public listening pleasure\nOf but they had been written like in the early hours of the dawn while my husband was snoring and\nSo I thought well if they're wanting something kind of light and funny I guess I could see I don't even really remember what's on those files that\nI brought my laptop in from the car and read a few pieces and they were in stitches and are they called the ... in and he listened and said hey this sounds like something different something we're looking for\nSo ah probably about a week or so later they did a conference call with me and said\nWould you like to offer some kind of little LA Weekly feature in the vein of Erma Bombeck or Patrick McManus or Dave Barry something like that so I just said absolutely that's sounds like a fabulous projects for me and uh\nI knew that they always say that Gen accent boomer women listen to the radio between Thirteen and Fifteen hours a week wow and my feeling is and you know not enough entertainment programs are aimed at\nThat demographic not that the show is it fun for for a male listeners to it's just that it's fun to a off or something that gives a little bit of a different perspective\nOn life on the high plains\nSo I didn't really know what to name the sketch a but one night again while ... story\n[laughter] I should pay that guy creative consulting fees I think\nI sat up in bed and I said oh my gosh little stuff on the prairie and I don't want to be defined by my husband I said I liked it spouse is words it's like non gender when Dale first met Joel he said something like well you're not little because my husband's really tall\nAnd of he said I thought you'd be smaller since you're the little stops and that I went oh everyone thought that Joel was a little spouse when in actuality I was doing it as I was\nSince you're the little stops and that I went oh everyone thought that Joel was a little spouse when in actuality I was doing it as I was a little stuff so I guess I liked that ambiguity\nBecause it gave me some kind of a oh you know some kind of a different interpretation is allowed I guess is what I'm looking for their so yeah that's that's just kind of how it came about and I can't believe it's been a year now\nYeah so it sounds like you you just kind of basically kind of pulled out your little side table journal and all of a sudden it became it became something that was aired on in five states for an entire year literally\nAiring all my grievance\nThat's fabulous well I Do love it it's a it's a female perspective and you know you have\nAs you said you've you've always lived here you've lived here your whole life so I think that is something that folks appreciate I've heard so many great things about you know the show and growing on the high plains prairie tales a high plains outdoors all those features we have I think is what really gives the station it's flavor\n'em and give it a little snapshot and that's what people who listen to radio love about radio you get to actually have the story and you get to have an experience with someone\nRight and it does have a bit of continuity to it there's a you know you can listen to one episode at you know as a stand alone or if you've been following the show I insert little puns that will mean something to\nUh people who have listened to a number of the shows because they'll be like oh yeah I remember when she talked about that but it still absolutely digestible in those ones you know one episode segments as well\nYeah and you know high plains public radio has you know we're a listener supported were community licensees so we have this very very strong connection with our listeners I can imagine now after a year you have a collection of you know back and forth interactions and conversations with your fans or any of the stick out that you want to share [laughter]\nI have a couple of good stories uh my mom told me about a young woman that she met at work and my mom my mom was at that time working at an eye clinic and\nIn a small town in western Kansas and somebody came in and they were just chatting about families and my mom mentioned that her her oldest daughter had a radio show called little stuff on the prairie and she told me that the young woman got all excited and said\nOh my gosh are you kidding that's my dad's favorite show I cannot wait to tell him that I met the little thoughts on the prairie mom\nAnd I guess what surprised me most was that it was the person's dad who was the fan the woman went on to say that her dad was like in his seventies and considered at the bright spot on his Sunday Morning while he's driving the tractor around his field and I guess\nThat just shows that the audience is pretty diverse yeah I'm a lot of my fans ask me a doesn't Joel or your your children don't they uh get\nUpset to have all the silly things that they do you know aired on the radio but\nJoel loves the attention he's a huge fan of the show he's always been a storyteller and a talker and he doesn't know a stranger I'm so and of course I read all the episodes to him before I you know before I even record them and he's never fled she just kind of one of those guys that can laugh at himself and people love him for that reason among others\nHave been creative control that [laughter] exactly the super supportive\nMy teenagers in my I have to uh older kids and then a little one\nAnd you know my teenager has nixed a couple of the sketches that she didn't like I think there was a there was a story about a baking mishaps that she gave a thumbs down on and uh\nTeenagers do that don't they [laughter] exactly [laughter]\nSee and then my my little girl my little girl Clementine who is just now six she loves loves loves the show she listens to it over and over again and if I ever talk about her she thinks\nA little girl Clementine who is just now six she loves loves loves the show she listens to it over and over again if I ever talk about her she thinks oh my gosh uh there was one episode where we went to the thrift store and we ended up buying back a whole bunch of the toys\nThat we ourselves had donated before and she ... that just tickled her ... she was like mom I use those were our toys that\nAmazing snow we we've heard Joel's voice before I Know I've heard him on promos and he's a it sounds like he's going to be on a forthcoming episodes\nWell I'm trying to include him a little bit more it's kind of a logistical problem when um I I record in
