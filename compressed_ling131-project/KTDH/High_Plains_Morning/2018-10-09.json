birthday celebration every five years since we turned twenty\nAnd so this time will be our first time kind of combining that with a gala event so it's going to be the red tide gala a we have thirty five local artists for thirty five years and in this time we have five young child artist some Rembrandt and training if you will\nThat have taken these wouldn't unfinished children's chairs gone and deconstructed reconstructed painted decorated turn it into their own work of art and so we'll have those available for auction at the event\nAnd there's a there's a photo with all of them together in an armada and it's just so beautiful so colorful and I love to see all the different interpretations um tell us a little bit about what Ronald McDonald house does for those that don't know I'm\nSlowly so Ronald McDonald house is a home away from home for families that find themselves in Amarillo with kids in eating medical care\nSo you could have a family that just travelling down I forty and they have an accident and their kidneys medical care they can come stay at the Ronald McDonald how you might have a family with an early baby are probably about Seventy percent of our families have a young premature baby they're eligible to come stay\nAny medical care for a patient they can come and say if they're only going out and so we have laundry services for them we have a food pantry we have meals or transportation if they don't have a vehicle we can get them to and from their appointments\nAnd so we know they're under a lot of stress when they're here dealing with those issues so we just want to be kind of a second home and it always is for them during a difficult time\nNow how how many folks do you normally serve like in a given year\nSo we have our family room at the north west Texas which is kind of a place for families that need a risk by that are up around the clock taking care of their kids at the hospital have a shower have a place for them to do laundry have kind of a quiet room\nFood pantry we have meals or transportation if they don't have a vehicle we can get them to and from their appointments and so we know they're under a lot of stress when they're here dealing with those issues so we just want to be kind of a second home and an oasis for them during a difficult time\nNow how how many folks do you normally serve like in a given year\n[noise] so we have our family room at the north west Texas which is kind of a place for families that need a risk by that are up around the clock taken care of their kids at the hospital have a shower have a place for them to do laundry have kind of a quiet room I think we had six hundred new registering to this past year there\nAre two hundred families would stayed at the house um this past year and we had\nI think two thousand families that we had delivered poised to their kids at something else or twice a week we deliver a gift to every pediatric patient in both of our area hospitals\nSo all in all we served probably about twenty five hundred to three thousand people\nWhile that's fantastic uh now tell us a little bit about the actual event it sounds like you're really going all out for this you've got in addition to having all of the artists that you know donated their time and energy and creative talent to doing these chairs and making these beautiful little works of art\nUm you've got the five kids uh they got to do it yet but you also have you got food you got music you've got all this all this ... tell us about that\nYeah we want the focus to be on the chairs because that's something special only do every five years but we wanted some other activities for people to come and enjoy while they're celebrating her birthday with it so we have six local rising star chef from some of the best restaurants in town that are going to have their own food stations will have drinks I'm Maggie Burt\nIf you're if you know local music or\nShe'll be coming to doing music I'm gonna have some other auction items a lot of wind poll I'm a raffle in our hope and toward the end of the night we can kind of pushed him of those tables and chairs out and turn that plays into a dance floor\nThere you go now or wind Paul uh I remember that that that's basically where it's a blind or wind thing where it's like the the winds and bags some of them are worth more than some of them are worth less\nThat's correct you just pull the cork and it'll have a number on it and then there'll be a corresponding wine bottle hidden in a bag and whatever's in there is what you get might get a Fifteen dollar bottle of wine or you might get really expensive bottle\nYeah that's so cool I I worked on wind pull one time and a guy came up and just gave me the hot tap it's like you know you can feel that shapes to tell if it's a red or white and I was like oh my gosh I felt like I had received like the power bracelet it was really crazy so I'm just given that I'm just going to that advice out there like the rest of the white think about bottle shaped\nBottom I [laughter] I Will keep that in my\nWell I think it's just fantastic the work that you do um obviously there could be nothing more devastating that having to deal with you know the thickness of a child\nUm Enron went down and have come forward and just makes it a little bit easier for the family so this is a very worthy cause folk that's a really a gallery seven to eleven PM this Saturday Night coming out support the cause and thirty five years that's pretty nice\nIt is we did some research the other day just kind of looking at some records were curious who all has benefited from the house and so we opened and since Nineteen eighty three we've had about Seventy thousand nights of lodging for families where one of the first houses to come into existence there's\nThree hundred and fifty worldwide now we're in the first fifties so whoever was on that committee in Amarillo was really thinking ahead of the
