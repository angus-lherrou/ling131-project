the Supreme Court who have been accused of such crime directly has not been founded what what they're saying shifts at one of the central tensions\nOne of the things which really divided the country in the last several days [noise] as well we'll talk about that a little bit more a mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nSorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary the well was poisoned from the outset\nWhen President Trump selected judge Kavanaugh\nFrom the list of names pre approved by hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest is a trifling concern compared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority on the Supreme Court\nThe rock worse and when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee\nShielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public just guarding decades of bipartisan precedent and warning norms of transparency and the fairness and finally the dam broke under the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault\nIn high school in twenty Eighteen the Republican majority conduct at a hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings and Nineteen Ninety One look fair by comparison\nIn this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side no independent investigation of the fact to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel to put a witness Dr Ford on trial\nOnly at the eleventh hour urging a breakaway members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly to a one week investigation of the allegations\nAn investigation which was then severely ... scribe by the White House our Republican friends blame us for this

floor\nBut in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats from moving forward when it comes to complaining about delaying\nTwo words never come\nFrom our Republican friends lips Merrick Garland\nRepublicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign where the politics of personal destruction within the nomination in reality again they're using Democrats as a strongman\nBecause what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward or conscience did and our Republican friends are are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford\nAnd her deeply held memories of what happened to work\nOf a smear campaign are they choosing doctor for the smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction because that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony and then trying to blame Democrats\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee when future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate's conduct here let them look back on this chapter\nHe's now on the line Mr ... mourning mourning what are you hearing there [noise]\nWell look I think uh there is a lot of uh shouted fury on both sides about this nomination but there's only one thing that matters which is how a a a very few number of senators are going to vote and\nTo be the indications are that a judge Kavanaugh will be justice Kavanaugh by by the end of this weekend\nOK bottom line there now Mitch McConnell has taken to the floor of the Senate majority leader so let's bring that up and give a listen to that thanks to\nToday the Senate has the opportunity to advance his nomination every one of us will go on record was one of the most consequential votes you ever cash and the Senate\nNow the stakes are always hard for our Supreme Court nomination but\nCollege the extraordinary events original wage have raised them even higher this time when we vote later this morning we will not only be deciding whether the elevator stunningly well qualified judge shore highest court\nNot any more about after all this United States Senate will also be making a shape\nWhether the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence\nOr will reaffirm that in the United states of America everyone is innocent\nThis time when we vote later this morning we will not only be deciding whether the elevator stunningly well qualified judge show our highest court\nNot any more about after all this the United States Senate will also be making a say\nWithin the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence\nOr will reaffirm that in the United states of America every one is innocent until proven guilty\nWill either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob and ... are valid tactics for shaping\nThe Senate the mob can attack\nAnd the Senate Kay\nAll set up and say that serious it's awful fact based deliberation\nWill still define this body\nWill either give notice\nIt totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy an American flight\nOr will declare that our society cannot and must not well not set the bar so low\n\nSo I'm at I'm president today is a pivotal day in the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate\nAs well the ideals of justice that have served our nation so well for so long or on full display\nSo let's sit back and sample a few of the choice moments that the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle of the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was announced as the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare that this nominee would pave the way to turn it\nCrowds of far allowed protesters\nStill filling out in the blanks on they're picking sides that weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle in which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil or you're fighting against a more recently\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy met\nAnd I'll listen to this\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\n\nGet due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great confidence offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties that was incredibly enlightening\nWhen it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\n\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great coughing offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties\nThat was incredibly enlightening innocent jokes\nBeer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings at play until of course one number of judge Kavanaugh classmate set him straight earlier this week\nThey'll stop and consider the snapshot the absurdity\nThe absurdity the indignity this\nIs our approach to confirming a Supreme Court justice this is the Senate's contribution\nTo public discourse\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about delay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce a made up their minds are totally opposes confirmation mere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated my friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated it was on the bottom like\nClear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means necessary\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind it would be delaying tactics\nObstruction\nAnd so called resistance until the final vote which calls\nFor a fair wage their average played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here\nThere were excuses for delay those fell flat there were broach destruction to a judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside doctor first and there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice\n... ... women hospital the vulnerable people hospital workers same old tricks same old playbook but here's the problem\nThey all players weren't working the distortions were being literally drowned out by the facts\nSenators received an reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nCombined\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nA pen we are sworn testimony written a couch from Hungary\nThe old players weren't working the distortions were being literally drowned out by the facts\nSenators received an reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nCombined\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nA pen\nWe are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts\nWas nothing like the character pure nothing like the character\nSo it was fair amount of president they owe taxes weren't working what are you going to get the job done\nThe resistance demanded more try something new they said well we all know what happened next I'm corroborated allegations of the most sensitive\nMost serious or were quickly sharpen\nInto political weapons\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and confidence with the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nSomehow mysteriously found its way\n\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly set out on a sober focus search for the truth the community collected testimony organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's Seventy seven FBI investigation\nBy and embarrassed that are the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward no corroborating evidence\nNot not\nWhat's produced a support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh no corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiry\nOr from anywhere else nothing\nWell that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after all we sort of get it by now\nAnd just today than looking again at the FBI report looking at every detail that he possibly could I'm just trying to keep count here a little bit Scott Detrow if a flake is yes at least on cloture if Collins is aghast at least on cloture\nDoesn't it looked like the Republicans have fifty which would be the bare minimum fifty one if vice president Pence had to break a tie there there is that correct\nOr two no votes sink the nomination is if either Murkowski or management votes for cloture then yes disadvantage to that okay\nSo we're still one vote short or they are still one vote short that as the situation\nThat's right and this bill may drag out but this is a more formal vote than usual you see the senator sitting at their desk standing up and announcing their votes which very rarely happens ... United\nLet's give a listen to some of that this bring that up and give a listen Moran\nMs Murkowski\nMurphy okay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or unclear if he's not there yet most\nWill vote if their names are called and is more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that ... voted to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you're in\nStanding up and announcing their votes which very rarely happens ... United let's give a listen\nTo some of that this bring that up and give a listen Moran\nMs Murkowski Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called and is more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that ... vote to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you know you're in a deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nVote absolutely and we do see a number of senators that there is that is very often this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or there'll be standing and knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people that are close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely aren't even before all of the controversy of the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice was one of the most formal you know historical things kind of do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask you about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation that would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cash that or an addict thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the combination\nFor Mitch McConnell of a a lifetime really of campaigning for changed federal judiciary unless you're supposed to listen to a little bit more as they go through the rules are\nKilling Mr Toomey Mr Udall\nThat's your Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote their Scott Detrow regime that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal\nOK so Lisa Murkowski is a no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe Manchin\nA at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live the vote is in is it fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so and do you see that's right or you can't have a firm stance vow the final vote goes until they banged the gap\nAnd there could also be a senator home we have assumed as a yes or of assume does it know who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference well we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay telegraphed really even when he made the compromise with tune\nAnd Chris Coons of Delaware has yet to Delaware went and checked to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for Brett Kavanaugh but I also don't want to blow this process up over there let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report\nThe Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves and they have been er and they're really that are that we're in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence\nIt is I Want to vote for ... cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over there let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report\nThe Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and they're really that are that we're in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nA that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the convention a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this\nConfirmation process has generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling as is now more or less close Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been who've been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking only we only eggs senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is a correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia who we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin\nThat's right Brett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced it keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabin all along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he is one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat\nAnd he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback I mentioned in the final month\nHe's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate that has to vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us this vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally the not quite final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex component has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio\nTo remind people who may be joining us this vote is not the final vote there was another one sometimes senators would go

and it's been involved in many of the political battles in recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidates\nMarco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nHey Steve could be with him\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell\nYou know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into them in terms of the midterms are barely a month away that's the big ... big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think it was looking for something\nTo get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been a doozy has them gap as a lot of the surveys have shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that you know really narrowed in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh on to have a when I think is just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through a political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that a parent gain and enthusiasm right now we are months out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters\nAs ... and that was a challenge for us going into the ... it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are gonna be more amped up and the people that are\nKind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen in the way that the Democrats from the Republicans perspective have basically engaged in in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism Republicans as a whole\nAnd Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to to exceed is just sort of a nail in the coffin in terms of locking down for ... years yet\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because there were probably almost certainly be after the election\nThere was no corroborating evidence against him that many of the charges were nonsense and he told senators this is one of the most consequential votes you've ever had and it's a vote that went for capital this is

only Democrats supporting Kavanaugh's nomination\nLisa Murkowski of Alaska was a key no vote which surprised when people she had been on the fence all along\nShe voted no so it's a party line vote
