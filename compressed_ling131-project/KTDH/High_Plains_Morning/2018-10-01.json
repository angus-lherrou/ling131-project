really cool\nAll right well let's start at the very beginning I Want to hear an origin story how did you to meet how did you each individually get started in music\n[noise] uh well I was originally from Ozark my sorry I'm just about three three hours from Kansas City and I wanted to live in a bigger city with big buildings and the chief [noise]\nSo I talked to a suitcase and found a job in Kansas City and um [noise] unfortunately some things didn't work out with\nThe buildings and the chief [noise] so I packed a suitcase and found a job in Kansas City and um [noise] unfortunately some things didn't work out with my apartment living situation so I had met why it through a restaurant that we both our cat\nAnd he very kindly not knowing who I was and not knowing if I was a murder or not invited me to come to end his closet [laughter] I could move and\nTo be clear it was a walk in closet and with a twin sized bed and she was fed twice a day that I was very nice very nice\nUm and so that time that we had you know we got to know each other and we both you know play guitar I had just started he's been playing before he was born\nProducer in the room [laughter] so you had an in utero guitar put in there that are happy with a it's an it's an interesting new trend I think it's All right yeah\nSo yeah we started writing together he had a couple of times he hadn't finished and\nI let him sit there for years because it just I couldn't finish them I knew it wasn't meant for me to finish them anytime I tried to co right with people didn't feel right so to show them and then the time like I said that we were just relax and and I'm showing\nA we ended up I brought one of those songs up and she had the national answers to the the things that I had written on there and that first song color ended up making a being a semi finalist and the some of the year some writing competition you found that you found a partner absolutely and we've been doing it for five and a half years now so\nGreat it's an awfully Midwestern story it was coming up yeah I haven't been out there and they're coming from the health of the hills of a rural area coming out to look like now that St working out I'm going to live in a closet for a while\nTo get myself together but it worked our way I Lived in a closet it's great yeah um we definitely want to have some uh some music here so what are you going to pay for it who\nWe're going to play our um our first single\nFrom a couple of years back it's funny 'cause I actually the first two are and we ended up a chat chewing the sound
