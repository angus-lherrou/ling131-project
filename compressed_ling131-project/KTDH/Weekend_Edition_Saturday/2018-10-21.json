Navarro\nSaudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire since the Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis it's playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy pleasure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or any of that issuing statements supporting a both ... and that I think so and of course that the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worry that the people who are activists journalists dissidents\nI'm at Goshen navy speaking their opinion\nIt's a lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion on may in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nTrying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east in American ally though far from a robust democracy house it's affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they are looked like a hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well an activist and others so there are clearly not a the beacon of liberal democracy and the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically defending or\nYou know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question ... what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why exposed Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated that\nUh they need they need hard currency the foreign exchange they need to invest meant that he'd investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with ... with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see the balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for uh the u._s. government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty four teams students from the teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City poor demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we're presumed killed in and around the town of why\nAlthough the remains of never been found their deaths were very deeply blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups in the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis in the shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations now Mexican journalist and I've been hadn't and this has published an exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students\nShe told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version the Mexican government said that the army and the ... they didn't know anything about what was happening and they just get not these two oh gee I Wish ... every\nThey didn't know anything about what was happening and they just get not these two or three hours after everything and be seized official start eat what I have been known these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official version is ally is not true its ally [noise]\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the for the police not just where not nice about why do I ... that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just these even more\nI had reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up all these white chasing the student scenes they laughed at school I mean so yeah it was before that that [noise] so the federal police and the army were chasing the students

fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students are on this plus has disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police\nAnd the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling inside buses that that it was just too\nI'm not so nice to versus what exactly did two votes is that the army and they said that police it starts to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses was that two votes is where the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know\nThe students the ...\nVote the army and for the police they knew it\nSo these students were almost victims of

I Love dogs with that kind of dressed up in your outfits we heard it on the radio and I I'm not the dog didn't look about happy about that yeah lots of lots of talk right as a real of a lot of young people\nOn the small city there especially people that\nCouldn't vote in the last referendum ... they were too young and they were the ones saying that's what I being they think that being saddled with a mask basically which is severely affecting ... so a lot of them are really pushing for this people buy on any kind of Brexit deal the British Government um agreed\nWell ... is another referendum even possible I mean we have these very chaotic negotiations um\nThe prime minister they're really struggling to hammer out a deal um is a vote possible\nSo legally if possible we could have\nThey stuck in ... ah the prime minister Theresa May have said\nThat's not going to be another ... but that could be one technically however it would take months and months to plan a second if I get older legislation in place and as you've had a beginning what ever sneak you to leave in March they probably if that was going to be some kind of people's votes it would have to then\nThat the day in March would have to be put back for the British Government would have to agree to that and all the other countries in the ... say twenty seven other countries yeah we'd have to agree to during that so it's a it's a big asking this amount of time reading\nThat the b._b._c. Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state well\nIt is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that developed if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket it's going to impact be state legislative seats even more\nIf there is some kind of blue wave that developed if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSaid they're just gonna maybe about ... the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states that were really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those rates is\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad pothole\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans the hammering the same issue\nYeah I I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping that score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate\nWhich is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house but if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah\nThe taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have changed a lot of uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the ... the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nRead Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty

Navarro\nHead of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival ... as long you\nLive with\nCruise himself hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nPut your name is Raphael you know you go by ... that's an NGO sized version of it he went the other way and just this week\nMassachusetts

Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA tests\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized says that we reached him earlier this week\nYeah it's a professor of philosophy at NYU has written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but I think that we can over your identity and we can bring identities in when they don't do much good\nAnd also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work than they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other so that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best\nStill matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em too seriously and many political context I'm\nThe most important thing in that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should uh be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who is best for you and other grounds so you have to balance it out\nIs the role of identity politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collapsing\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should onto your question directly gingerly carefully [laughter] I I think you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing\nIs mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that lean down a terrible road because once you've created as a racial division\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds\nAnd um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the ... century they're drawing people together or through making them feel ashamed of hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings with a very intense kind\nIt makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means you lose the sense that in an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm hearing a real narrative concern that identity and and the politics around it has been weaponized and and it certainly\nYeah I think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is in our country today is that where more divided around identity then we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come to reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every confession is not coming together but losing\nLosing to the other side\nIn in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it's it's an out make sure that your base is satisfied and making sure that you will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nYeah now the question is whether you can do that with that what you cold rightly weaponized identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies democracy needs the capacity for\nFor promoting order and I think your time I think you can talk for example more about the actual bonuses democracy man across the room for compromise and coming everything into an identity as he makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is the lives that bind rethinking identity thank you very much for your room of\nAmerica's
