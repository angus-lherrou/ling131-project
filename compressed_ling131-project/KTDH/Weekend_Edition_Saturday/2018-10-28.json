the impacts in the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had we had to change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year and a homemade county where I stand with is

hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning highly the [noise]\nUh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims\nWell let me know that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be really very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals and memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well yeah this alleged shooter\nHas been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime well it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media\nAnd he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the mode of how it happened why it happened and what else do we know about how the attack happened\nWell authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning it was a an out of religious servants was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at that scene\n[noise] put this into context for us so there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRight I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over\nAnd and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRight I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um well not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil again eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an active hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThe mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America\nAt a rate unprecedented in decades yeah\nAnd we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh It's MORNING\nRight um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue up to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials\nI'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a ... a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner and and this was you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think a point of pride in the community the neighborhood and the synagogue and\nUh people are grappling as they as they do it I don't know what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were a vigil last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding yeah what are they mention\nThere will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting plates\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so uh that's just one small thing the communities doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThe tragedy that happened again and again around the country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n[laughter]\n\nYeah incredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nI'm as something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside\nNonetheless the president or President Trump yesterday afternoon addressed the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside that's in a God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very

essentially you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA of course you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it or what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well I\nThink you need situation than it and I I've not been on the ground here if it's for too terribly long myself but um I think what you'd see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three that was my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just the world are trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there is this the search for why after the the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for a crime so they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant of motives\nThat told us something about why that might have happened again that still under investigation but um it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happened and also a week but to know more about about the victims soon\nAnd we're going to bring in ... or Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara a good morning It's MORNING\nSo set the scene for the president's response and and basically how we are actually starting this press conference and now I'm we're going to go there live here we go\nI Can't say enough for the interagency interagency support\nA western

saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case she's ... is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on the story we turn now to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning\nMourning Louis [noise] All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect to say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces and then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seemed to be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here [noise]\nAre there any new details on the investigation well are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested a so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge\nAnd how does one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source that a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet or any other help\nAre we getting a picture of how he became this extreme\n[noise] yeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen you had a very troubled life lots of arrests but he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and bodybuilding night life\nAnd then two years ago all this anger a political anger starts coming out in in social media wants thing really struck me um he lived in a van hung out on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale in Parkland the community that had that horrific school shooting the sheer\nIt's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I begin making all these attacks against David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent

who's been in the news so much lately in in ... in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you suddenly co workers including one who was in that town\nYet Deborah gr Reagan was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWould start talking about that let me last Hitler\nWe should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we thank you so much thank you living\nIn these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity in politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and did Scott's we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers rate for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black Florida or the teen of voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters ... but when we talk about white voters we rarely meant and their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about\nEducated voters or evangelicals are we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and the voters of color are somehow the only ones who engaged in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so I have tweet it frequently that when we see something like that\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so I have\nTweet it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does that accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voter because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise]\nWell I I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election what we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a\nIn a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why but our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country\nMany journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles so when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut why voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also that sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how did those two things then sent when you're trying to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition
