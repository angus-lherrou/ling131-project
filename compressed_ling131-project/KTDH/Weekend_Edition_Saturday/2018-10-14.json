Navarro\nThe terms of less than a month away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate House and many will also choose governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the G O P is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down he Jessica\nLulu so can Democrats cut into the geo piece edge among governors they haven't really good chance they could pick up as many as a half\nDozen or more seats and it's incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be a census that will effect redistricting says how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten\nThey controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional map to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it's a good sign for Democrats that math is really for them what states you watching heading into this last month of the campaign I mean where they're really tight races some couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum when sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American mayor from Tallahassee so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple state\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt um Nevada in Ohio\nAfrican American man from Tallahassee yet so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple state\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa's it's going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams will be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of taught steps but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places are in really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administration in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican polarizing nominees friendship is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally he only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role and places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Marilyn Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you\nAbolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the call gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but you don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue in debates and declining to take it up in Congress\nAnd yet progressive activists have won a number of victories convincing local

shouldn't profit from President Trump's immigration crackdown\nOn youth night because you do have power and it may not be a lot and maybe for one county in one state over one did anything better but if we can get this thing down here in a county we can do what we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five ten five hours Hudson County voted to end the ice contract but not until twenty twenty that way to counter you would have time to replace the tens of millions of dollars it gets from ice\nYou all democratic board of ... county legislators in New Jersey or known assured residents that action would be taken years Anthony remodel\nIs a strong possibility we will say that even\nThough it's not just rhetoric\nAcross the country local officials are responding to ants\nI think Eli we can

Sacramento County and the city of Santa Ana I pulled out of their contracts with ice in Williamson County Texas a detention center will no longer hold immigrants\nAnd didn't Atlanta the mayor issued an executive order to stop accepting ice detainees but all of this is not happening without push back\nYour job then they tax paying down\nEvolved balls or a lifelong resident of Hudson County accused

we see more and more powerful storms hitting us it has many thinking about how to make the nation's power grid more resilient\nNPR's Jeff Brady reports\nIn Panama City Florida right now this is a common sense [noise]\nPeople who were lucky to have them or using gas powered generator utility crews to fix all the downfall of wires and restore their electricity they county emergency services chief mark\nBowe and says that will be a long slog\nThis electrical system was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the air is on the ground

system was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the air is on the ground now\nAcross the entire region the damage from wind and flooding is extensive says Scott parents and that the edits an electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to do respiration that is pick up the wires reset the pole and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nHit the expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills\nAbout one in ten that data up to twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce alliance and you're right it can actually be much more we can take like right after ... ... ... and an

grids more resilient\nOne thing ... would like to see more of is independent micro grids with solar power and battery that places like water treatment plants hospitals and facilities where residents can't easily evacuate\nAnd we all need to be the same restraint chain of ensuring that critical infrastructure vulnerable population it keep the lights on even if the project powering down\nMcNamara was lead author of twenty Fifteen report that called for more renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gases from power plants and address climate change that's a longer term view of how to make the grid more resilient but that report was before President Trump was elected promising to boost fossil fuel industries\nJeff Brady NPR News\nMichael hit the panhandle just as the voter registration deadline for next month's elections closed in Florida we know Florida as a big potential prize it's also hosts a bunch of closely watched political races this mid term season mark a poodle covers Florida

ago\nYou've seen a lot of them comes through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction caused\nI think Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast I remember the city of Cleveland, Mississippi looked a lot like Mexico beach looks now if there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs\nAnd then all of the associated destructive miss that kind of turns a once lush area into a desert just stripped clean\nYou've seen a lot of them comes to do what are you thinking about Michael in the level of destruction caused\nI

or many signs of human habitation and construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against wanted sentence a former congressman who also has a lot of important pockets of Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it couldn't name and what is the likeliest scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and then it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally\nRisk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over ah both physically in these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a steam leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is an executive albeit\nOf the city of Tallahassee the mayor but it was pretty hard it was hit yeah a ... Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in the uh the the county of Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent run the census for his leadership during a storm hurricane her me this time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seeing a visibly\nIn in one case actually chainsaw in trees away [laughter] and\nI'm moving debris really so he's changed raised well he's making\nSure Gillum is that he is not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone is trying to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess that remains to be seen ah what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they are going to be people that are going to be looking at this\nOh sure we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire panhandle is going to be almost impossible pull right now 'cause you can't get a hold of a half you know eating some of the people\nThat political as my computer joining us from Florida this morning thanks so much thank you\nTomorrow on MORNING edition after big win on the Supreme Court Republicans and conservatives seemed to be at the height of their political power but will that\nFor Floridians in it and I guess it remains to be seen ah what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be ... that are going to be looking at this\nShort we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire pan handle mail is impossible for right now because you can't get a hold of you know ... percent of the people\nAt political as my computer joining us from Florida this morning thanks so much thank you\nTomorrow on MORNING edition after big win on the Supreme Court Republicans and conservatives seemed to be at the height of their political power but will that change after November tuned in to MORNING EDITION to hear what's at stake for the GOP and their majorities in Congress you can ask\n'em you can listen by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your member station by name\n\nFears the chain of department stores has been a part of American culture for a hundred and twenty five years the commercials from my childhood Senegal\nKenmore\nMy most commonly used phrases these days is well that\nLasted a hundred years [noise] I really have no hope at least until Clementine leave the house and Joel passes on a reestablishing forward progress in building my collection\nTruth be told I have one dusting shells actually experienced moments of gratitude that life has shattered so many cups and saucers life's accumulation seem to\nFollow a bell curve and it's possible that I've come to the apex of mine I don't want my children to fight over the rolling pins and snow Globes after I'm done so I'll start labeling everything here in the next few years it's only a matter of time before they start calling did [noise]\nFollow little spouses face the dot com slash little house on the prairie or on Twitter at spouse on the prairie at Valerie creature a [noise]\nLittle spouse on the prairie years of the same time each week it was a production and why planes bubbly radio written voyage Valerie brown Boudreau with production assistants and you have like the news it by jelly words\nMore little stalls on the burn episodes can be found online at H.
