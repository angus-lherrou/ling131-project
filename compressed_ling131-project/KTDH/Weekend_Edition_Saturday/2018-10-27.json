I Would go according to reports she's arrived there is it possible someone told him posed with the prince and you can get out and hear\nAbsolutely uh there's no question the royal family had banned him from traveling since his father had left the kingdom to go into exile and there had to be a lot of behind the scene maneuvering including a request\nSpecifically by the United states and secretary

Jones Day dot com and from the listeners who support this NPR station\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon\nLast week federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint which described efforts by the Russian backed Internet research agency to use Twitter bucked the influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports Andrew beaten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact Russian trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem beaten joined us from New York Thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nWhy was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took a knee or not during the plane or the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just people that are weighing in on this is a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly\nWhether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you were dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets had begun all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen President Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life\nIn Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University\nWho helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players\nSo it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation Mm\nSo it it it wasn't directed achieving a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught\nContentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to attract the bit [noise]\nUh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with the is it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole one closed down new ones pop up and one of the interesting notes that the constant professors had was that these are closed but they're monitor new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations\nAnd they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charge moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on\nTwenty years is not a lot of time if you're say Betty White\nYou know what the gift for twentieth anniversary is drier Lynch\nAnd we

thoughtful\nNews ... exactly we knew that people just didn't take NPR seriously enough with all your frugality in high jinx so we decided that we needed to finally try to acquire a reputation for sober consideration at this network and I'm Glad to have done it\nThanks so much I'm Serious question yes um they're serious chilling events a school shooting range church bombings in this week along thankfully no one's harm bomb threats so much harder than others to have fun with the news\nOh yes but we know that we have a particular role a handling all that stuff\nThat's your job and we know that what our audience wants is for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff and focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad the more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and really brings a silly [noise] you've had so many um famous gas and\nThe more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and really bring the silly you've had so many um famous gas including of course of a president of United States to two presidents of the yeah we had ... before he became president but I'm taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to be since [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appeared post presidency that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions that are inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case that for example and we can show the audience that he's actually a very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Cage to but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being I Love bill Curtis yeah how could you not and I miss Carl Kasell\nWe all you've had some great

yes yes and he runs a little shall we say salacious I Believe that the public radio word will use\nAnd every now and then our audience gets a glimpse of that but my favorite thing is when off air

pumpkin spice in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friend she teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't CNN the political and these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negatives but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on ...\nAny worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tend to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content on line\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter such as the season on through [laughter]\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being\nConnected to terrorist organizations and that kind of explicit attack\nIs not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions are being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nWell yeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say that it's a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle that you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic and those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael friends are voting college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure and it's where all weekend edition Sunday Lulu looks at our political rhetoric and language may affect us and how we speak to each other you can listen to that story tomorrow morning by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your station by name\nAnd [noise]\nAnd it's time for sports [noise]\nThe art or fiction is dead by the time our group began to get up for work there the longest gaming World Series history was still going on\nIt you know names seven hours ... minutes longer than the playing time of the entire Nineteen thirty nine World Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers one three to ... months the\nIn the bottom of the eighties Tom Goldman joined us Tom are you there are men are you there your way yeah\nAngeles Dodgers one three to uh walk off home or by max Muncie in the bottom of the Eighteenth Tom Goldman joins us Tom are you there are men are you there your weight\nYeah now I'm here I'm here oh my word what a game\nUnbelievable I I watched all of it well kind of all of that I I watched um [noise] you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen to Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was an absolutely riveting and and stunning\nEighteen pictures used including by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best picture on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter he didn't even throw the ball or does is anybody left to throw the game tonight\n[laughter] well the Dodgers have named starting pitcher rich hill\nAfter the game Red Sox manager Alex Cora still haven't decided who he's starting later today in game for he had used up pretty much everyone that's part of his when now philosophy and that includes Nathan you've all these Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max monthly ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker bealer regattas a healer\nDealer [laughter] my God he was a brilliant this with two games you know literally was to nine inning games and for the first game Walker Mueller was the star uh he threw seven innings he was given the ball and asked to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no team it's ever come back in the world series from a three hour deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal\nWhen with Walker Mueller being started then I does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win the ... that's a good question to ask either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into game for but\nThose teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so the one thing we can say we've got a series now and uh\nIt's fun Tom Goldman thanks so much You're welcome the dual Bob\nCousy and bill Russell was one of the greatest they were\nTo Tracy
