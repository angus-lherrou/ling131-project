V. did do form does not work for\nMost people I met raises the question but here's the primary hesitation I have that in every state has adopted medical marijuana use has found that with him just become an open door way for recreational marijuana use the the doctor's permission to doctors are\nFar more prescriptions are off somebody in the medical profession and they'll go buy candy and then the marijuana just becomes a ...\nPermission to doctors are part of the prescription or off somebody in the medical profession from Canada though like Andy and then the marijuana just becomes a recreational marijuana state\nThere's one other issue at some time on them to the tune that's industrial I'm all for that and we have what we need to our agriculture more corrupt diversify him and that is something we can be and should do and\n[noise]\n\nI used to be a hospice trap one and I assume your facts of what we were in the street individual who's terminal and so they want I Would find in order\nTo use of marijuana for and the white chair when the music just individuals place on hospitals to be like\nUh we've had such an opioid crisis across the nation I support the criminalizing a marijuana recreational 'em up for the quite think our state there's been lots of studying to\nA five year study of Colorado back to show the negatives of however I Do feel that uh\nIf we would be criminal mind the same amount of money for state and uh I Am for best drove him those prince of mentioned but ah I think this was something that we need to continue to work towards as far as medical use goes in secret scientific research concerning like\nThat the state fair debate Mr Kobach told medical marijuana supporters to going to Reno [noise] that is pouring here the monster that is horrible\n[noise] I don't know what\nI thought I always wore fully what are they in they have\nSchool funding earlier this year but yes they are telling us how they're going to pay for it I support only what they should order to help pay for that school funding increase in order to prevent your characters from increasing we need to get help in Kansas we need to make sure that people will start going to other surrounding states and it's time\nTo get revenue off of the injection into our economy\nIf you go to the national Cancer Institute website they actually show that there are studies out there that shows that cannabis potentially shrink tumors\nThey are preventing us from getting health\n[noise]\n\nWell I er I actually don't even for the bills that allow them to do research on you know that to the alternative products products products um\nI Do support legalization of medical marijuana or I think it has significant medical uses for children with severe\nEpilepsy uh I also have said that does help the end of life in the situation to them and\nChronic pain I think it's one way along with expanding Medicaid or that we can deal forthrightly when our opioid crisis I Do think we need to examine our sentencing guidelines because right now what we're doing is we're putting non violent\nOffenders behind bars or we're destroying their founders were making it possible for them to work on and we are costing the state affords you uh so I Would support reviewing or sentencing guidelines\nMedicine or medical marijuana to court and him [noise]\n\nMedical medical marijuana support and and [noise]\n\nWe have an opportunity for a thirty second revival warming well I I heard first of all the monster before but never for three dollars so [noise]\nYou know I Would just reiterate that the other advantage for medical marijuana in states are adopted at their opioid addiction read just about twenty percent lower and when you look at dealing what what what are they real January a health crisis in this\nWould be another a potential era and the effort to to solve the opioid crisis on campus [noise]\nVery about mumps or when I'm a member of a sure how to respond to that one although I suppose they could and became a survey patients at one thought that I Would say mom for making an argument but look I if I have to be careful because if I make more than that that just by theory or he might normally among for again hopefully my wife is one of the\nLet me return to him you don't have it actually something that has so many uses of the possibility that the ... thing of course the drought resistant and we need diversification of Kansas or for agricultural crops and there was a real benefit here and I think that's one way or the legislatures renting movies well I'll get it you know\nWell once again to be promoted version of a you know just having a mouse marijuana I think it's going to say more space we used to be the finger there's some profitable manner you know use common sense but uh\nYou know we do have a we were encouraged them since I got a lot of counseling while the drug and alcohol counseling you're so you know to\nBe able to get the opioids off in your people remember like ... another option I think that's very important so thank you\nThere are millions of people in Kansas to fully support medical Canada\nAnd they don't want to build and they have to go get because the FDA approved and we have children that have seizures they need access to medical cannabis that is a personal ideology that was the spouse going to read those [noise]\n\nOur next question do you believe that state of Kansas adequately fun\nK. twelve education please explain your answer and we'll go first to Mr close\nWidespread earlier that you know there's this perception member wage for money on education and my kids are at their investments and education everywhere I traveled the state teachers students will buy supported\nAnd their salaries ... too quickly so we've been in the courts too long let's let's move on I mean we're on the twenty first century and a look there's going to be waves that we can uh\nFunding education sports betting you as an option\nUm I ... I was thinking about oh it was well all the reserve\nMoney that we've been seeing after we paid things off in the state we can put money towards that\nUh there's there's things that we can do to uh you know take care of our kids when when we value our children and our grandchildren and I just had three\nOf one on the way to now one on the way uh I find a way\nAnd I just think this was just common sense let's just take care of her to the curb education thank you [noise]\nEducation has more than a sixty second response um it our our state averages almost fourteen thousand dollars of taxpayer dollars per student every year\nThat is a very high amount of money that is not being allocated properly I Believe that we need to look at how the money's being spent and that requires me working with the superintendents and making sure that they don't\nAbruptly waste the money unfortunately that being said I Do want to bring in the cans education liberty act which would bring competition to the public education system and allows for\nParents to send their child to whatever school they want you could send your child to the highest quality public education system\nParents to send their child to whatever school they want you could send your child to the highest quality public education system or you can send your child to the highest quality private education system\nYou'd be the one in charge of deciding where you wanted to send your child to get educated and I believe it's time to have direct representation of cans and in the state of Kansas [noise]\nSenator Kelly\nThank you yeah I tend to beginning [noise] my husband and I moved to Kansas thirty two years ago because of the great schools I voted against the brown backpacks experiment because I knew what it would do to our school system and sure enough\nWe experience the highest cut towards schools in state history I led the bipartisan effort to overturn that experiment and we are now funding our schools again\nI Want to be the education governor I Will pledged to to continue to fund our schools to make them even more robust and bring back the stellar school systems and number one in the nation that we had\n[noise] miss her arm\nYou know my wife taught in a title one school in Kansas City Kansas my running mate a Senator John ... has been a teacher and coach for Twenty years\nOr the ... will be the best advocate for public education that we have a in Kansas\nI Will say however as if we look at the debate over funding you know often times what we end up focusing on our solutions from\nPast decades you know and I'm the one hand we hear people saying we need to go to private school voucher as well other than parochial schools there's one private high school west of Wichita I'm not sure how private school voucher solve the problem for a kid and you get them on the other hand we talk about things like spending hundreds of millions or billions of dollars more money on the top of the final\nYou know at the end of the day I Want to cause I Want to solve the root cause of the problem one of the issues if you look at education two thirds of the achievement gap between low income kids in high end some kids was caused by one thing\nThe summer learning deficit we need more summer learning and more summer reading programs for kids K through wait if we want to address that and get better educational outcomes in Kansas [noise]\nSecretary [noise]\nWhen it comes to Casey probe education that way too many people have been asking the wrong question what's the total dollar amount the correct question and the one of the heart of our policies and the Kobach Hartman ticket is where the money being spent right now only fifty three sense of the dollars being spent on classroom instruction\nUnder our plan it will be a state law requiring Seventy five cents of every dollar being spent in classroom instruction\nAnd what's happening right now it's being ... predominantly especially in district to the east of here predominantly and very expensive buildings and overpaid administrators let me give you some statistics in the past twenty five years the number of students and keep your job of going up\nTen percent the number of teachers has gone up Seventeen percent but the number of administrators and managers have gone up forty percent that's where the money's being spent and that doesn't make for a better education\nSo that the first part of the plant Seventy five cents at the dollar in the classroom second part of the plan is reward schools that are doing well under my plan to get every school\nThat are great and if a school goes up a letter grade based on past performance everybody in the school building all the way down to the gender or race\nHad our thirty second revival period I'm part ram because of education where we'd be in the last number of years and you know I'm for parents choice whether they want a home school private school\nEducation where we'd be in the last number of years and you know I'm for parents choice whether they want a home school private school I've done both so much has been in public school and graduated\nBut again how do we view our children are they going to ask for ... Smith religious or building\nA funding education also through online sales tax have been looking into that that could generate a hundred and Seventy million dollars there was a perception that the lottery was supposed to do that and that's not true but maybe there's a way we can ... look at something there I just feel like folks we can take care of things if we let our mind to do thank you [noise]\nWe need to return our education system back to the local communities and you should be responsible for allowing your children to get the education that you want them to get\nIt's not up to the state and tell you how to educate your child as governor I Will work with the independent districts in order to allow for the most freedom for you to choose how you want your child to be educated thinking [noise]\nThank you you know a Chris keeps talking about how ah we don't put money in the classroom how we're so inefficient here there was actually a study a paid for\nBy the Republican leadership and the legislature this past year and that study independent study found uh that Kansas schools are among the most\nRecently run a in the state so the numbers that are being presented to you here are not true the fact the matter is if you look at their administrators you it's one percent\nIf you go down to the second tier it's ... percent the money is going into the classroom or support services like food service transportation or they think they're absolutely necessary for school districts to function [noise]\nOne of the things that my wife said that really resonated with me about public education is that the best education policy is a growing economy\nBecause so much of what affects educational outcomes in the classroom happened to a child when they're not in the classroom\nDid they have to work until two on the morning at a convenience store to make ends meet their parents have to work two and three jobs and so they can't be involved in their education that the kids come to school hungry all of those things have a huge impact on educational outcomes that's why we spent so much time\nFocusing on growing the economy so we can invest in those priorities without raising taxes [noise]\nAnd secretary Kobach [noise]\nIf I were grading any logic class I Would give men's Kelly dancer an F\nShe just said that because there is a study that schools are efficiently run there for the state statistics I just gave you about the forty percent increase must be false\nNo one does not imply the other statistics are correct we have a ton of money on diminished ration the fact that a private company to Kansas school they're pretty officially run\nDoesn't change the fact of where the money is going and let me tell you if you spend a ton of money on a shiny new building in a lot of ... that doesn't necessarily mean your students are going to do any better I Would say the scores will remain flat as they have [noise]\n\nLiving on to another topic what is your position on Medicaid expansion metric called well\nI Do not support Medicaid expansion but sixty nine percent of cans and support Medicaid expansion and I am running for Kansas as governor I Will work to allow for more private entities\nAnd support Medicaid expansion and I am running for Kansas\nAs governor I Will work to allow for more private entities to exist within the health care industry\nRight now we have three giant corporations in control over of Medicaid in in Kansas\nAnd I call that a government granted monopoly to these three giant corporations it's time to bring competition it's time to cut the red tape it's time to allow for insurance companies ensure cans over state line\nThat's another typical politicians answer which was basically I'm going to find a you know the federal government has been working on this issue in theory for decades\nBoth parties have failed to solve this problem in Washington DC\nFor those people are saying Democrats have been working hard on this issue\nAnd two thousand nine they had sixty votes in the Senate they had a Seventy six vote majority in the house Obama was in the White House and they didn't even pass the dream act\nOut of committee or they like the issue a whole lot more than they like the bill what do we need to do about it we need an immigration policy that's tough practical unfair by top I mean we need secure borders there's no question about that now we've doubled\nThe number of border security agents on our southern border since two thousand five we need to continue that\nWe need to be practical we're not going to find and deport eleven million people nor would it be humane or economically advisor\nFive we need to continue that we need to be practical we're not going to find and deport eleven million people nor would it be humane or economically advisable\nWestern Kansas would be decimated so how do we make it fair to taxpayers I say if you're here on undocumented basis you register with ice by date certain you pay a small finer perform community services or knowledge met the law was broken but then if you hold on a job you pay your taxes you a barrel laws you should be able to stay here and work [noise]\nSecretary [noise]\nWas Laura Kelly punted I'm Greg just basically took the football and tried to run into the stands with it you can't do that you can't actually adopt a an amnesty type program when she's describing as another that's something that Congress actually would do another question was what can a state do what can I Want a governor actually do well I think\nWould hope that one thing we would agree on is that we do need immigrant labor but it should be legal immigration not illegal immigration\n[noise] we're a country\nWhere the rule of law is what made us so great were property rights are secure where our constitutional powers are we are limited that is why we're such a prosperous country\nNow one thing I Would also hope with good every on is that we should not reward illegal immigration with taxpayer funded benefits Kansas gets three hundred and Seventy seven million dollars a year every year to those who are in the country illegally that is a way of rewarding illegal illegal immigration and policy like that are why we have a caravan\nMarching north to come to the United states because we give up the goodies as soon as you come across the board\n[noise]\nAnd this is why we need to do politics better and treat people as human beings with respect and dignity and even if we differ with them and I think we'd\nGet a lot of further when we talk about immigration now I'm pro wise for cheap with that value or all the darker people\nNeed to to to be here they didn't have a say in the matter and so we need to get past the so and then you know I'm for secure borders or you know we need to look at our guest worker program\nAh I traveled the state and so many farmers and ranchers says undocumented immigrants are not ... they're like family took they're telling me this and so you know once again when you value people your perception will change them\nOr I'm some feel think people need to obey the law hold a job you know pay their taxes but you know and and try to somehow work with the federal government to make a pathway to citizenship easier it is it's very difficult right now in\nChallenging but uh we got a quick quick quick chicken people out and and be you know humanitarian the people after all who's our neighbor thinking [noise]\nMiss her home\nKris Kobach says we need to respect private property rights well you know businesses should be allowed to hire whoever they want as long as they don't harm somebody else I Believe that we need to deport all illegal immigrants who harm people that's the focus that we need to focus on violent criminals\nI Believe that we need to change our um immigration policy at the federal level and speed up the process we need more people in the system we need more peaceful people to come to Kansas\nWhat we need to do with the federal level is integrate an immigration policy that only included security check disease check and um\nLevel is integrate an immigration policy that only include security check disease check and I'm I'm\nWith the security check the check and um I Can't remember the third one but it shouldn't be that difficult to become an American citizen it takes people at the twenty five years to become an American citizen\nThat is astronomically high and that in that actually once that Dr illegal immigrants and we need to get them into the system as soon as possible so that they are responsible taxing people [noise]\nWell I thought this moment would never come but I actually agree with secretary Kobach\nA that Greg Orman plan sounds great but the fact of the matter is this is an issue that has to be taking care of on the federal level and I think that's why we need somebody like me who has a long track record of worth to working with others of Republicans Democrats or whoever\nOr to get things done and I will work with our congressional delegation regardless of what party they are\nAnd work with them to make sure that they're doing their job they're representing Kansas and they're acting on our behalf back in Washington DC\nAgain I just think that's not leadership we need a governor who's not just going to nudge a bunch of people who have clearly demonstrated no interest in solving this problem we need a leader who's going to stand up\nAnd tell people that we are going to create an environment where You're welcome where if you obey or laws you pay taxes you work you can stay here we don't need to be deputy seizing the highway patrol ought to be asking people for their papers harassing our workers\nIn creating an environment where people feel unwelcome or we need someone who's going to lead here and not someone who's going to nudge [noise]\n[noise]\nWell I don't think anyone would accuse me of just nudging when it comes to this issue look we're going to push hard and two things I think we will get done is number one we're going to stop giving welfare benefits to illegal aliens Laura can we have the opportunity to vote on a bill that would have done that\nBut she voted no to keep on giving those benefits without testing some of lawful presence number two we're going to end sanctuary counties in Kansas we have three counties but when I called and said\nThis is a criminal aliens that has a high priority for deportation those three counties say no not interested in helping you we're going to end thanks where you calling from Kansas she voted against the bills and sanctuary county does well I Will lead we will solving problems [noise]\n\nA ball or CEO but not everybody can be a leader I'm not going to leave the state of Kansas as a boy I'm going to meet people like always have more respect them I'm going to do what's right I Believe in our constitution\nBut we're going to be people were ... and uh we're going to try to have some understanding and work with people\nThat they can be here and then we can grow our state bro Kansas or not just for us but for the future generations to come thank you\n[noise] [noise]\nSo as I said earlier it takes people sometimes twenty five years to become an American citizen\nThat means we're missing out on revenue that means that we have people that want to come to America because they want to experience the American dream but they're not able to because of\nThe red tape that prevents them from becoming an American citizen but yet when they come in here and they get captured they're thrown back even if they're innocent people so we need to focus on violent criminals\nAnd citizen but yet when they come in here and they get captured they're thrown back even if they're innocent people so we need to focus on violent criminals we need to have a background check security check to check done\nThings [noise]\nOur next question\nSouthwest Kansas is they only quadrant in that state without a four year university what are your plans as governor to fail that's critical need for postsecondary education in this region mentor Orman\nWell uh again the reason I asked\nCentered all to be on my campaign as my lieutenant governor was because I thought he would be a strong and powerful voice for western in Kansas\nAnd he and I've talked about this issue as it relates to higher education and actually I think the biggest critical need we have\nAh as for career and technical education what we found as people who get career and technical degrees ultimately end up getting jobs within fifty miles of where they get that education\nSo as we look at the workforce shortage in southwest Kansas as we look at the need to provide qualified employees to fill skills gap\nWhat we really need to be doing is focusing on our career and technical colleges in this part of the state\nUh we have talked about two things that we want to do in that regard number one we want to close the gap and educational financing today if you want to get a four year degree\nOr a two year degree you can get a guaranteed student\nLoan if you want to get a certificate well then you're on your own we want a revolving loan funded deal with that we also want a tax credit for public private partnerships to develop workforce programs with our local community and technical colleges [noise]\nSecretary\nOn this issue or agree with ... with much of what Greg just said look if you go to a four year college in Kansas City on average you will end up with twenty eight thousand dollars in debt and tuition just keeps going up and up and up to where we're seeing some success", "show_name": "Classical Guitar Alive", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "26"}
