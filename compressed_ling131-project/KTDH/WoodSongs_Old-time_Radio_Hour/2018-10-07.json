I\nTurn this was before and Tina came to the Memphis recording studio to record a record and it was called a rocket eighty eight [noise]\nAnd the studio put it out under the name of its own record label\nAnd it became a huge number one hit and this is rocket ADA\nKnow and they lose money\nAnd that wasn't the only Nineteen year old kid that came across the attention of Sam Philips the owner of the Memphis recording studio you know this one\n\n\nOf the world and this became a massive massive record for them they introduced\nArtists like Johnny Cash and Roy Arbesman and and Carl Perkins in so

camera is a a is a true patriot of of a mini artist she supported guy Clark working heavily with Chris christopherson right now and she's really a supported\nThe legacy of many artist so the idea of her working on the tribute to sun records of certainly appropriate for her\n[noise] and I and I see around\nAnd so you're you're Tom tell me about your interest in the Memphis Sound and you as an artist you're interested in the Memphis Sound your interest in the music that Sam Philips brought forward\nOr through the vehicle of sun records or this is something you were interested in this little kid or does come out well yeah I mean I\nI wasn't fully aware of what's on records was when I was a kid I was familiar with some of the music but it wasn't until I was you know a teenager that I and I was playing music already that I've sort of study to Doug in and started getting realizing this was all under one sort of umbrella you know the stuff that I heard was vaguely aware of as a child\nI became obsessed with and then when I realized it was all one thing I was like oh wow I Am completely completely changed my whole way of saying about music like it does for anybody that really delves into that catalog but um that was a before I ever moved in Memphis and then I moved there about twelve Thirteen Years ago and uh\nI'm just really got to be a full time student Memphis music and get to be immersed in it and around some of the people that made it and it's just been a real uh\nUh it's been an amazing sort of experience as a musician living there and soaking up the Memphis thing kind of being an outsider but now can totally considering you know I'm you know but ah yeah it's a\nAnd the ... the Memphis sounded so broad you know you talk about another sound but there's more than one son records is one thing and if a state of Stax Records Hi Records are that you know there's the the uh there there's not a Memphis Sound there are Memphis Sounds you know\nWell and here we are celebrating one of those sounds as as delivered by Sam Philips and has a record label son records Amy you worked at sun records as as a tour guide let's talk about the recording studio room where all of this magic happened Roy ... Johnny Cash\nJerry Lee Lewis a course Elvis recorded his stuff there's not a big room\nTo\nFade you might need bigger than the actual tracking round one car garage really with the radiator shop was radiation [laughter]\nNow it has the white picket tiles I'm a law aimed at for whatever it is that day [laughter] that this child\nAnd ... and had to fill that hole peaks and valleys all along with half of the room like how profound in there and then when they ... family ... looking through the window with the band\nAnd the way it was the way the room was portrayed in and walk the line which you were part of the motion picture in one of the actresses and in that that movie that was a very accurate portrayal of of the room and the way Sam Phillips work with the artists\nAnd they actually and I actually kind of\nBuilders and they built it pretty they'd be able to hold\nWork with the artists and what they actually um I actually knew senator set\nBuilders and they built it pretty they build a whole nother studio down main street and then the with the storefront to look just like it inside there because they the owner is fine with respect for the people that come from all over the world\nTo the studio that he didn't want to curb it to the public is selling so they had to build that I\nHad to build their own\nWhile we had to record the sun sessions at night after seven after they've finished the tours right so we did the daytime ... operating\nStudio here and I did hear but only at night do they do they have to do they have the same recording\nBoard that they had the old the old to this whole new stuff yeah yeah oh staff knew all\nThey don't have the actual the actual yeah they do actually have one of the portable recording devices that seem to go around and make field according to British artist that's in the museum and that's really cool things I in a studio at new\nThe actual console that same ad is at the rock and roll museum or that they actually\nStill exist it's just just not they're not operators amazing I give props were props as do again I mean it's amazing how good those records sound even today on the modern sound systems with the gear that they had to record back then\nSo it's a combination of really great songs really great musicians and Sam's ears and the engineers that he\nHe worked with well it's a it's an album that does a fitting tribute to that legacy it's called red hot it's a tribute to Sam's tulips and the music of sun records and we're going to turn our attention to John Paul keep this was a tune called red Cadillac and black moustache right here on the would the songs old trying\n\nThe other no alone to share the load on\nGood do you do wrong\nYou love and lose a\nYou real cool care or\nUsing\nDrew boos\nYou look\n\nYou
