just fine\nLives do the ... man [noise]\n\n\nThe the odd thing is that you actually accomplish did you super seated all the expectations you became a big\nSuccess [noise]\nSo you're driving as says let's talk about the the Allen Jackson cut because a lot of times a lot of times um you write a song an artist likes it and they kind of\nPut a hold on it for a while yeah\nAnd it's sort of precludes another artist from recording it so you had an artist\nTechnically put a hold on on a song that\nCame to Ellen Jackson's attention tell them tell me how that happened that time was actually on hold for two other artists for the year proceeding when Alan hurt it out of a publisher at the time we played it for Allen's producer and he put it on hold on for another artist at first but it turned out they weren't sure about the timeline for that album and what was going to go on\nSo that the lunch with Allen one day and said I got a song I Would love to play for you to get back to the office in Allen really liked it and yet the artist was gracious enough to say you know what I don't know exactly when it's going to be cutting so I don't want her to miss that\nWhen I was a song Monday morning church was a beautiful beautiful\nToo [noise] so [noise]\nWaiting for something that you knew that there were art is interested in the\nSong and you're waiting and you're waiting and you it was\nKilling 'em know again I didn't really know anything at that point in time Alan actually ended up hanging out on spring break my senior year in college\nAnd would tell me about the first time you heard it you're you're probably in your car like everybody else and listening to the radio\nActually uh Gary Overton Eddie amount of kind enough he got a copy of it because he's worked with Allen for years and he cannot stand by me and to hear that cut\nAnd you know it's really it's a strange thing it's almost like you're watching a TV show or maybe somebody hooked up a computer and ran your song through it and made it sound like somebody else it was it was really amazing\nWhat about the first time you heard it on the radio you heard Allen singing your song on the radio\nWell I I don't know if you've seen a movie called a thing called love but it was about like that and driving down music row and heard it and we're actually on music growing here yeah wow the\nTalk of the serendipity the stars are lining up for you that I said another claim to fame that you had this kind of important in Kentucky and all because he was the voice of Kentucky tourism now but you were a Chris Stapleton upstairs neighbor I was yeah so so what was that like he must have been an interesting uh fill a downstairs probably singing and working all the time\nReally helped me carrying a wardrobe upstairs [laughter]\nSo what let's talk about the changes in the music business because I mean the last ten years has really\nAffected the ... not the music in the musician so much because they're still there and they're still passionate and they're still working and trying but the music industry itself has really changed music grow has really changed\nIt's interesting ah you know there are good things and bad things about it it's you know technology is changing so fast um\nYou know I think about my granny growing up she didn't even have a radio when she was born and uh what all we can do today and it's really amazing to think about all the innovation that's happened and I to me I think it's a good thing because I think there's a lot of possibilities for independent artists that maybe weren't there before um\nYou you have a lot of independent nature in your career and so I mean you're getting major cuts with with important artist but but you are a singer songwriter that also views yourself as an artist\nSure in your career and so I mean you're getting major cuts with with important artist but but you are a singer songwriter that also views yourself as an artist as as one of those performers\nThat's what I moved to Nashville for I I really I started writing songs to have things to saying and I'm I think I was lucky in that way because maybe I didn't know ... when I was trying to write I just tried to write something\nI Love that I'm kind of fell into it\nSo now you have a you you have the series of of singles that you sort of releasing on your own one of the time told me about that to tell me what you're doing there\nWell I put out an album last fall called wiki town crier that I'm really proud of Jimmy Johnson a gym it's brown to produce it I'd say that I was a kid in the country music candy store get to do that have got to have all my favorite players into play got some friends of mine a critic came in saying on a couple of songs and rainy Hauser and Ricky Skaggs\nWas just a really special experience and then since then I've been recording some\nKind of one off more acoustic bass songs ah just because you know as an artist it takes a long time to do an album that you want to have something new and fresh she wasn't fresh baked cookies out there to share with your audience\nWell Allen Jackson even set in one of the song lordy don't the wheels turn slow and hey let's say if it is true and it takes a lot of ah there's a lot of work being patient\nThrough the through the process but speaking of whiskey town cry which is a great great title because that's that's what they used to call people who shouted out the news yes ... is that how you view this album is sort of like a ... claiming in the news or on the state of a community\nYeah it's actually it's a famed record and so it's basically supposed to be an auditory newspaper for a small town and I'm really big into characters and stories on so each one of these songs could be\nA little a article in the local paper\nWell a lot of place I Would can recommend living it seems like a really bad it's like well a\nHeartache so pretty good these days so now you've got this beautiful album is called whiskey town cry or you going to dip into that album for this particular song is called ... just like a cowboys Aaron enderlin on the ... songs soul time\n[noise]\nUm\nThere were days it did
