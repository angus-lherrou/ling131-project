juggernaut jug band on the which will try\nAnd raise [noise]\nAnd\n... was on his hands grains around the gum and often jazz music I Love to hear that ... man\n[noise]\nNothing seems\nPaying him about

just fine\nLives do the ... man [noise]\n\n\nThe the odd thing is that you actually accomplished you superseded all the expectations and you became a big\nSuccess [noise]\nSo you're driving is supposed to talk about the the Allen Jackson cut because a lot of times a lot of times uh um you write a song an artist likes it and they kind of put a hold on it for a while yeah and it's sort of precludes another artist from recording it so you had an artist\nTechnically put a hold on on a song that came to Ellen Jackson's attention tell them\nTell me how that happened that time was actually on hold for two other artists for the year proceeding when Alan herd it out of a publisher at that time who played for Allen's producer and he put it on hold his for another artist at first but it turned out they weren't sure about the timeline for that album and what was going to go on\nSo he goes out to lunch with Allen one day and said I got a song I Would love to play for you and get back to the office in Allen really liked it and the other artists was gracious enough to say you know what I don't know exactly when it's going to be cutting and so I don't want her to miss that\nWhen there was a song Monday morning church was beautiful beautifully written\n[noise]\nWaiting for something that you knew that there were art is interested in the song and you're waiting and waiting and you will was\nKilling 'em know again I didn't really know anything at that point in time Alan actually ended up hanging out on spring break my senior year in college\nAnd would tell me about the first time you heard it you're you're probably in your car like everybody else and listening to the radio\nAs well actually uh Gary Overton at him I was kind enough he got a copy of it because he's worked with Allen for years and he has kind of stunned by man to hear that cut\nAnd you know it's really it's a strange thing it's almost like you're watching a TV show or maybe somebody hooked up a computer and ran your song through it and made it sound like somebody else it was it was really amazing\nWhat about the first time you heard it on the radio you heard Allen singing your song on the radio\nWell I I don't know if he's seen a movie called a thing called love but it was about like that I'm driving down music row and heard it and we're actually on music growing here yeah wow the\nTalk of the serendipity those stores are lining up for you that [laughter] another claim to fame that you had and it's kind of important in Kentucky and all because he was the voice of Kentucky tourism now but you were a Chris Stapleton upstairs neighbor I was yeah so so what was that like he must have been an interesting uh fill a downstairs probably singing and working all the time\nReally helped me carrying a wardrobe staring at ...\n[laughter] so what let's talk about the changes in the music business because I mean the last ten years\nHas really affected the ... not the music in the musician so much because they're still there and they're still passionate and they're still working and trying but the music industry itself has really changed music row has really changed it's interesting\nAh you know there are good things and bad things about it it's you know technology is changing so fast um\nYou know I think about my granny growing up she didn't even have the radio when she was born and uh what all we can do today and it's really amazing to think about all the innovation that's happened to me I think it's a good thing because I think there's a lot of possibilities for independent artists that maybe weren't there before I'm\n... and you you have a lot of independent nature in your career and so I mean you're getting major cuts with was important artist but but you are a singer songwriter that also views yourself as an artist as as one of those performers\nThat's what I moved to Nashville for I I really I started writing songs to have things to saying and I'm I think I was lucky in that way because maybe I\nThat's what I moved to Nashville for I I really I started writing songs to have things to saying and I'm I think I was lucky in that way because maybe I didn't know who are thinking when I was trying to write I just tried to write something\nI Love that I'm kind of fell into it\nSo now you have ah you you have the series\nOf of singles shorter releasing on your own one of the time told me about that don't tell me what you're doing there\nWell I put out an album last fall called wiki town crier that I'm really proud of Jimmy Johnson a gym is brown to produce

rainy housing and Ricky Skaggs\nWas just a really special experience and then since then I've been recording some\nKind of one off more to stick bay song uh just because you know as an artist it takes a long time to do an album that you want to have something new and Fred she wasn't fresh baked cookies out their share with your audience\nWell Allen Jackson even sit in one of the songs lordy don't the wheels turn slow and hey let's say if it is true and it takes a lot of uh\nThere's a lot of work being patient through the through the process but speaking of whiskey town cry which is a great great titles 'cause that's that's what they used to call people who\nShouted out the news yes ... is that how you view this album is sort of like a ... claiming in the news a on a state of a community\nYeah it's actually it's a theme to record and so it's basically supposed to be an auditory newspaper for a small town and I'm really big into characters and stories on so each one of these songs could be\nA little a article in the local paper\nWell a lot of places I Would can recommend living things like really bad like well a heartache\nSo pretty good these days so now you've got this beautiful album is called whiskey town cry or you're going to dip into that album for this particular song is called a minute just Laker cowboys Aaron enderlin on the ... song sold
