Harvard Square to discuss the topic did to all of a halt the precarious future as America's public lands national parks monuments and wilderness\nI'm Mary ... director of Cambridge forum and tonight we're fortunate to have with us Steve Nash the author the book in question Grand Canyon for sale public lands versus private interests and also Michael Brune executive director of the Sierra Club\nSteve Nash is the author of to award winning books on science in the environment he's currently a visiting senior research scholar at the University of Richmond and when I first spoke to Steve and I just finished reading his poignant piece in New York Times about the threatened by as is\nAt the University of Richmond and when I first state to state and I just finished reading his poignant piece in New York Times about the threat stash is money and then in Utah is on school was in ... he said politics and precious friends\nYet despite that depressing picture he painted he told me that this is pointless to explain what he meant by that and to discuss his latest book please can stay than Nash [noise]\n\nWhile I'm honored to be here thanks for their generous introduction and thanks to all of you for coming out this evening on here tonight to provide a picture for you of public lands are tired of an update they include our national parks of course that we're all very familiar with the public lands also include\nOur national forests wilderness areas wildlife refuges or national range lands and grasslands\nAnd you may be surprised to hear that taken together these accounts for almost a third of the land area of the United states something over a million square miles it's also true\nEspecially if you live east into Mississippi that most of us don't know very much about those other public lands but I address you tonight as their owners\nBecause all of us are the holders of the deeds of trust for all of these public lands whether it's a great meadows National Wildlife refuge here in Massachusetts or the barrier or snow mountain national monument out in California\nAll of us collectively set the rules that govern the future of these public lands as a matter of national policy\nWell\nYou might ask so what if your daily agenda includes nuclear standoffs and terrorist threats and Russian trolls yeah Donald Trump and more Trump\nHow much room do you really have for concern about public plans\nWhy would you pay attention to a faulty lights which when the roof is on fire so allow me to make the case that public lands are worth your curiosity and your surveillance\nAnd perhaps even your engagement because they're part of that burning roof and because we can no longer take their safety for granted\nTheir habitat\nAs most of us know at least from photographs for a range of wonderful\nCharismatic photogenic species for jaguar and walls and grizzly bears are for antelope in Honduras these are all animals that are under a great deal of pressure many of their\nPopulations are diminishing but also public lands are habitat for\nThousands of species of plants and animals that we never hear about public learns who are biologically rich and often very scenic\nAnd the way we choose to manage that land or will be crucial for increasing their odds of survival all all of those plants and animals especially with the advance of what many scientists are encouraging us to call climate disruption\nRather than just climate change but know that this is not just a conversation about wild species public lands are also playing in a central role in our own wellbeing and I'd like to offer you just a couple of examples of why that is let's start with air pollution\nAnd I'm not referring to small but two storms of Arab\nWhy that is let's start with air pollution\nAnd the numbers for into small but two storms of airborne topsoil\nWestern public lands they're semi arid many of them and in the Nineteen thirties they were often over cloud and over raised and they were one factor in what became our national environmental catastrophe we remember it now as the dust bowl\nBillowing clouds of dirt blackened disguise periodically for years\nThat led to some restraints on grazing but these days ruin us over grazing of western public lands continues and they are at least mainly to extremely wealthy cattle industrialists not to picturesque ranchers and cowboy hats that are often tried it out for\nA photo opportunities\nIs this really such a big thing is how much land or are we talking about public lands raising occupies land area equivalent of Massachusetts\nNew York New Jersey Virginia West Virginia Ohio Indiana, Pennsylvania South Carolina Maine and the state of Washington\nI think are a number of the mall that's three hundred and Seventy eight thousand square miles of publicly owns grazing leases\nAnd those leases or a bargain by the way you can feed a cow and a cast for a month on our land for less than you'd pay to feed your goldfish\nBut even the federal agency that administers\nMost of that grazing land admits that at least a quarter of it is unhealthy because of over grazing and another third of it about a hundred thousand square miles they don't even know what shape outlandish in and with the droughts and the heat of climate disruption\nResource managers have told me that the loss of top soil to wind and other kinds of erosion is accelerating\nAlso raising heavily pollutes the scarce water supplies and the west and as you can imagine it thoroughly displaces wildlife habitat\nWhat would happen if we stopped all this destructive grazing on our land\nWell we wouldn't run short of hamburgers\nPublic lands grazing only accounts for one percent of our national supply beef\nAnd we'd save a lot of money because it costs six times more to administer these grazing programs than they bring in income and of course the ecosystem losses are staggering so we would save a great deal on that are kind of two\nHealthy and protected public lands are also crucial for water quality primary reason for the establishment of the national forest system\nA hundred or so years ago\nWas that those forests many of them had vanished in both eastern and western states that was true in the White Mountains national forest in fact when you're Eighteen is the centennial year for the establishment of that for us which was heavily logged\nEven on a steep slopes and ten percent of it has burned because of irresponsible and unregulated logging\nWhere I live in the southeastern or doesn't national forests all of which had been burned\nAnd logged in some times plowed to ruin for the same reason so with widespread political support we created the national forest system in a effort to bring those lands back to health\nBecause the slopes were denuded of forests topsoil mud washed into reservoirs and and threaten public water supplies and many places\nSlopes were denuded of forests\nTopsoil mud washed into reservoirs and and threaten public water supplies in many places up here the rivers including the ... river were flooded with mud um it would have worked for industry and also threatened water supplies a lot of that situation has improved\nIt's still a work in progress on our forests are obviously in much healthier shape now in fact these days twenty percent of our national supply of clean water dependence on our national forests grasslands\nAnd we know that our president has a certain affinity you might say for real estate development so we're waiting to see what happens with all of that too\nRealistically are national parks are going to see pump jacks and drill rigs and fracking but all those other public lands you might think of them as our great American out back\nThey seem much more obscure and much more taken for granted and I hope we can bring them to the front ranks of public consciousness because they're now\nUp for grabs\nAnd much more taken for granted and I hope we can bring them to the front ranks of public consciousness because they are now up for grabs\nWell to rub of\nPublic lands are or inheritance where the beneficiaries of our grandparents and great grandparents they fought off countless misguided and self dealing privatization schemes to keep public lands in public hands\nNational parks or national forest those are accidents of history and we're going to have to continue that fight if we want to keep them for something else that\nWe have to do and sometimes it's not easy either\nWe have to keep up our hopes that word hope\nWe usually think of it as I Know and maybe or something like holding your breath and keeping your fingers crossed\nBut I Try to pass it hoping it's not so useful now\nMy favorite college is David or likes to say\nHope is a verbal which leads rolled up\nThank you very much\nYou are listening to Cambridge for him in Harvard Square as we continue our discussion of Grand Canyon for sale\nPublic lands versus private interests with all set in science reporter Stephen ... well I just would like to start the discussion I'm kinda got mixed feelings about I I'm Still hopeful and depressed the\nSame time the Italian resulting developed just I couldn't believe my is when you talk about that it was the on my belief um and I do think building bridges is called the ...\nWhen I I read today about all the different lawsuits that currently I'm In progress against the Trump Administration and I just wonder if I'll pockets and energy\nDeep enough and sustained enough\nTo when I went to sing [laughter]\nWell I think that when the odds look tall\nAs you've described though and it's not an accurate description it really helps to remember where national parks and national forests and a\nNational monuments came from it isn't that the odds work any better or a hundred years ago it was the age of the robber barons it was the age of ... pass or tell you that easily over matches the kinds of things we're seeing\nNow people found ways to stand up and blunt all of that and indeed\nForce it back on the other direction sure we had good leadership but that good leadership depended on political support is still there there's plenty of evidence of that and when we're talking about hope and\nSort of has to be tied traded if things look to brave and there is no reason for any of us to do much but if they look too grim done this kind of paralysis\nSets in so the situation is hopeful as long as more and more of a student at all\nOkay I don't want to hook the microphone please feel free to come up most of the questions\nAs you were talking I was thinking that it sounded like our government is subsidizing the greenhouse gas\nEmissions based on the grazing and also the fracking on public lands and I thought of in an article I read recently in the New York times about\nThe way in which the fracking companies have not actually made a profit due to the fact that I'm ... gas\nIs actually not a profitable industry and so when I heard you talk you're talking about us\nSubsidizing them and we're subsidizing a business that isn't profitable\nSee now I ... and we're subsidizing a business that isn't profitable so that just really makes me concerned about this and a ... like your comments they thought were about that and wondered what the current status wise\nI think it's another very hopeful thing that many of the policies of a crowd national administration that are very aggressively\nPromoting the development of fossil fuels are falling completely\nFlat because as you said or in the case of natural gas in some circumstances in the case of\nCoal ah resources in all circumstances and it's true often with with oil energy oil based energy also they're not economically competitive um that's really really true with coal so the whole idea of encouraging more exploration development of coal isn't going to\nGo anywhere\nThere are special cases\nWhere companies can make money out of ... gas especially if it's energy companies that are in a position to force their customer base to use gas rather than\nWhat is quickly becoming a cheaper source of power renewable energy\nIt seems like a lot of the discussion on a public lands seems to be about\nUm fossil fuel extraction when I was wondering about renewable energy development and if there's any current or\nA potential development of renewable energy on these public lands and ah what your take on that would be a is the worst are sacrificing every you know the natural beauty and a bio diversity for for renewable energy or is there even a concern is that\nA couple of examples of energy development on public lands that makes sense if it's done carefully\nLarge scale solar installations in California on public lands and in Nevada or they're welcome as long as their financial I'm\nOf a infrastructure that allows those things to happen benefits us taxpayers and protects the land so [noise]\nUm so solar arrays on public lands in California Nevada or a great thing because they replace fossil\nFuels have to be done very carefully because there are species or the endangered desert tortoise as a primary example if you encroach on their habitat with solar arrays it as it has\nBad consequences similar with wind power if it's not well sited on public lands and there are some examples of it on national\nForest there's habitat destruction from that it takes a lot of roads and pipelines some conduit send things and yet the in the process of thinking through how to do that carefully there's a\nGreat deal of positive advantage so [noise]\nUh a third example is wind power on I guess you could call them public lands but they're ... they're the sub aquatic public lands off the Atlantic coast [laughter] they've been surveyed so we know where the sensitive areas are now on the ocean\nFloor of the Atlantic on the continental shelf we know where we can put those windmills uh to to\nMake renewable energy and those things aren't going forward what has to be watched though is how they are monitored how they're designed and and how they're put in place we don't want to ...\nGoing forward what has to be watching though is how they are monitored how they're designed to an elder to put in place we don't want to lurch toward renewable energy in a way that's destructive the very kinds of things we're trying to protect from fossil fuels\nCan you comment about the American wild horses on the public lands and why there's such a drive to remove them from the fire ... say the alliance as is it not true that they are not damaging the public land at all but the cattle and sheep\nIt's a fraud question because wild horses are very charismatic they do have a damaging effect on public land\nThere is a case to be made however\nThat ranchers and trying to get rid of populations of wild horses are excusing the damage that they're raising cattle do\nBut horses kind of also damage the ecosystem to the to the disadvantage of a native wild species and so they do have to be managed\nOkay well thank you Steven mental this very engaging and informative discussion on tonight's topic contending for sale
