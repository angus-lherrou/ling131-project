newspaper cartoonist rope Rogers who was fired last week from the Pittsburgh Post Gazette he had been there for twenty five years is the editorial cartoonist and he said I quit\nAfter so many years of punch lines and character chose scaring mess and mullahs\nThe new regime at the Pittsburgh Post Gazette decided that the Donald Trump's satisfy when it came to editorial\nRogers a trip to the loss of his job directly to Trump and the fact that as a cartoonist he failed to follow the newspapers directive to echo the politics of the Republican publisher and so this is why we find ourselves\nThe battle for free expression and independent opinion continues and the country where the president has declared dead the free press is one of the greatest threat\nTo see just longer being full elsewhere

he's written about topics as I as diverse as international politics\nPopular culture privacy and generational politics I'm delighted to introduce the talented and always opinionated had rule [noise]\nOne of the things that this disruption has forced us to do and has made the difference between\nThe sixteen of us who are still around and the hundreds who are not is adaptability unable to trying new things and trying to figure out new ways to reach the public and in my case I started doing working in the graphic novel form and comics journalism\nForm back in the mid nineties 'cause it just seemed like really cool and there was stuff you could do that you couldn't do another format and\nA few years ago I sort of blended into what I'm doing these days which is a\nI'll keep doing until I get tired of them um the graphic novel biography format I was I'm necessarily critical it's\nThe I think it's sort of inherent to the idea of editorial satire is that you're constantly

like really cool and there was stuff you could do that you couldn't do another format and\nA few years ago I sort of blended into what I'm doing these days which is a I'll keep doing until I get tired of them um the graphic novel biography format I was I'm necessarily critical it's\nThe I think it's sort of inherent to the idea of editorial satire is that you're constantly making fun of people and uh you know I got my first grade report card the other day and uh\nThe comments from the teacher written in in pencil in Nineteen sixty eight said a Frederick which is my legal name said Frederick has an uncanny ability to hone in on each child Achilles' heel and reduce him or her to tears\n[noise] it's like and I have to say when I read that I was not ashamed [noise]\nI I think miss Taylor was extremely ... as a and perceptive so\nSo the thing is um the uh one of the things I tried to do in a like I was constantly being told and complained about my fans would say why don't you ever do anything positive don't you'll be heroes any role models people like you and I would say like who's your favorite president and I'm like well they're all scum\nSo none sorry and a ... and I mean I I Love history I Know there are all scum then like uh the Edward Snowden story broke in two thousand fourteen and uh\nI thought like you know here's a guy who actually did the right thing here's a guy who he's he fits every bill\nOf what Ted Raul looks for it he wrote he a person with integrity who takes chances who does the right thing even though it's going to hurt him or her personally and so I thought this is a story I really want to tell and I think I wanted to tell the story in a nonprofit down to where I didn't want to say\nOkay so ... if you're working at say\nThese days ice you should quit and steal document and give them to get you should actually that's the moral thing to do but I Want to just to sort of tell the story and be like where does that come from like why do we make this decision like you know what was it that made you know at the time there were tens of\nThousands of people who saw the same documents and they sat\nOn them and they went home every day to their children and their and their spouses and their partners and kissed him and went to bed and had sex and they thought they were good people and then Edward Snowden's like no this is wrong\nAnd he was the right wing or he started out as right where he's like I'm going to I'm going to change this up I'm going to take a new direction I'm going to fleet and I'm going to go on the lam and I'm going to and I and even if they kill me that's fine so what why would see different so I sought to answer that question and um so I did this\nBiography which I still kind of be only Edward Snowden biography really and uh it was successful and so in other words this old lots of books that doesn't mean that was any good\nUh but it was successful 'cause we live in capitalism and so when you're successful your publisher always comes back and says like do you have another one just like that but better more successful so\nAround the same time I'm sort of did the Hail Mary pass Bernie Sanders had just announced for president and I just had a\nVery strong instinct about him because I had been a following him his career for all of my life and I just thought he was a fascinating character and I thought his you know he was like\nThe guy who's been telling the same story that the country was finally catching up to and it was like well I told my publisher look this is either going to go gang busters or it's going to die dogs death because he's going to drop out of the primaries\n... says like do you have another one just like that but better more successful so around the same time I'm sort of do the Hail Mary pass Bernie Sanders had just announced for president and I just had a very\nStrong instinct about him because I had been a following him his career for all of my life and I just thought he was a fascinating character and I thought his you know he was like\nThe guy who's been telling the same story that the country was finally catching up to and it was like well I told my publisher look this is either going to go gang busters or it's going to die dogs death because he's going to drop out of the primaries like in ... in like\nMarch so but let me do it and he was like just do it and it became a New York times best seller it was you know a very successful and my publisher was very pleased and so then\nWe were like so who should be next in our in our trilogy of positive change makers so naturally we turn to Donald\nTrump [noise]\nThat's not really true um\nPope Francis is the is the is the real the ... we did a little detour and I kind of symbolized that with the black cover of the Trump book a which also looks a little different from the other ones to homage to one of Hitler's election posters from Nineteen thirty two or where it's just a photo of Hitler on a\nOn a black background that just has similar across so\nI'm trying to signify that like I don't really like this guy\nBut it was also trying to give the double his do until this report the story it's a very different approach because a proper biography of Trump in this format would have to be two thousand pages long because he had a very long history and he's\nHe's got a there's a lot to document I mean you know Edward Snowden was twenty nine when he stole all that stuff he hadn't done that much he never even graduated from high school so uh it's a kind of like a a a completely different\nCelebrated columnist and cartoonist Ted role that you'll find kind of engineering and physics right a lot of fights you get to a young aspiring to sit here because\nDon't to major in physics applied physics and engineering I'm actually best advice I Would give is um study history I think history is missing from uh\nThe context of a lot of political satirist they can't drawn it and it's it's very unusual right I mean if you think about like satire in other countries there's always a historical context I mean like China's an extreme example they have these satirical puppet chosen satirical\nCarts and funny cartoon that draw on stuff that happened four thousand years ago um but but like even in like say in England if you think of Monty Python there's all these historical references\nUm it's really rich and you know just even being able to say hey this happened to be for really helps you I mean even I mean America is the most Historical Society I think on earth you know people don't even remember what happened\nFive years ago so if you're even able to say like well you know actually Obama deported more people from the from the U.S Mexico border than all other us presidents combined\nAnd that's true they are like the really it's like so it's like you can say well look or like when people say like oh you know are separating kids from their families that's not the American way I'm like really never heard of slavery\nAs like a you know you you never heard of\nWhat happened to the Native Americans having their babies ripped away from them I mean this is like so if you have that knowledge of history it really helps you as opposed to just being able to just being like you do see a when kids are crying which is unfortunately what a lot of like you know commentary boils down to so my best advice is study history\nThey're like those really it's like so it's like you can say well look or like when people say like oh you know separating kids from their families that's not the American way I'm like really never heard of slavery\nAs like a you know you you've never heard of\nWhat happened to the Native Americans having their babies ripped away from them I mean this is like so if you have that knowledge of history it really helps you as opposed to just being able to just being like loose or when kids are crime\nWhich is unfortunately what a lot of like you know commentary boils down to so my best advice is study history for being history just read it\nSay when you were a small advocate school and did you have any friends [noise]\nThe answer is sometimes none at all\nAnd sometimes every but it just depended on the context it's kind of like how Bernie Sanders was a weirdo from Vermont until suddenly he's like the most popular politician in America which he is today you know if it's if the times catch up to you if you're in the right place in high school I was wildly popular\nIn elementary school I was completely ostracized but I went to kind of a hillbilly high school or elementary school\nSo I'm you know we're like having brown hair was unusual it's like village of the damned everyone was sorry everyone was ... it was kind of freaky and\nAgain I'm completely over that now but [laughter] but uh but no I was ... it was definitely um it depends it just depends I think if you have\nA if you rely on satire for um if you if you're a jokester\nAnd your prankster people love you were they hate you and that's just how it is and it's like you know if you I I was kind of like really taken by this uh this friend of mine who was a huge fan of George Carlin one time\nYou guys are going to totally this isn't live right you're totally gonna like believe me out because I'm gonna I'm gonna dropping F bomb so heat is George Carlin had a so she said it was my friend said she loved George Carlin she loved him for years bought all his albums seen him in concert many times\nAnd then one time he told the joke that just pissed are off so much but she just decided he was dead to her and I said of course I have to know what this joke is and here's the Joe the joke is have you ever noticed\nThat women who are against abortion you what are women you wouldn't want anyway\nAnd the point is I was like okay I'm not going to judge whether that joke crosses any kind of like let's just stipulate it's disgusting and massage innocence Texas\nA and locusts stipulated but still it was like this guy's got a high comedy's a high wire act I mean you know he's telling Allison's of jokes a year it's like the guy like screws up one time and he's dead you in any she's like yes and I was like it was like that I'm dead like and so I I stopped carrying\nIt was like and you if you care years just like not you know you can't do your job but if you don't care you're\nEventually going to get fired and ostracized and hated when you go into this it's like you know that it's a it's a suicide packed\nSet is kind of ... in your head because in order to to take something a pause you have to be able to be a kind of sat tests that society's conscience you don't have to be able to read the ... house and say you have to really be a tough one I did\nYet to be I think that's right I mean you know like look you have to tell people a lot of uncomfortable truth if you're going to be a good political satirist um you know if you want to be popular and make millions of dollars then you have to be Jay Leno but if you want to be funny\nAnd and important then you've got to tell people the truth but like for example the United states is a terrible country you know I mean just awful and that we have no business talking down to anyone else you know we're no shining\nI did absolutely yet to be I think that's right I mean you know like look you have to tell people a lot of uncomfortable truth if you're going to be a good political satirist and you know if you want to be popular and make millions of dollars then you have to be Jay Leno but if you want to be funny\nAnd and important\nThen you've got to tell people the truth but like for example the United states is a terrible country you know I mean just awful and that we have no business talking down to anyone else\nYou know we're no shining were real shining city in a toilet you know and like people don't want to hear that because it's like hey this is the country I live in and I pay taxes and it kinda sucks to live in a you know to be like a you know a good German and Nazi Germany but that's the reality and you know you just it's you just can't care\nUm and people are gonna like you were they are they're not I mean like I went through a really rough times uh after nine eleven you know when nine eleven happened I was writing spectacularly Hi I was in time\nFortune forums a Bloomberg ... ... a magazine I was in over two hundred newspapers and literally on nine eleven I was on my way to Philadelphia to pick up a five and a half million dollar check to start a Brooklyn alternative weekly newspaper so I was riding high\nThen like within weeks it all started to fall apart the my editor at time called and said we're not running humor anymore because no one will ever want to laugh again but the guy in Philly the investor said\nNo one will ever do business in New York again and I was like they do business in Hiroshima and then it's a it's like you know I mean there's just like\nIt's just like fortune like fired all their cartoonist\nEverybody was out of work the syndicates syndicate syndicates were getting like just overrun with cancellations and it took ten years\nTo just start to crawl back never of course got close to it the way it used to be and it's like never going to be in like big publications like those publications don't print any cartoon it's not like they don't like to draw they just don't like cartoons\nSo it's you know you you're sort of like things can change just like that you know just think you know Peter Max was a big deal one day then suddenly he wasn't I mean that's kind of like that's what like art is like if you're a novelist or a poet or and or an actor even it's like you can just fall out of fashion you're disposable you know American\nCulture is he's not like we're not like the French you know we're Johnny Ali day was like warships forever I'm you know I Love friends it's like you know it's not like that here you are just\nYou know but but it's the only thing I ever loved doing so that's why I Do it\nSent me the established a source of an idea that is totally that you call yourself ... says you think that's really important having democracy ...\nYou know there's always a ... a dominant paradigm in any kind of society and it has it relies on certain ... that are somewhat true others not so true and if you don't have a cast of people who are um satirist and just social critics and activists\nAnd anarchists and people are trying to undermine or criticized like first of all that society can't be vibrant and can never even reform itself\nBut it's ... it's doomed really to revolution in the future but even aside from that um if you don't have that like\nI think there's no hope for improvement in the future I mean the the powers that be don't wake up in the morning and like you know there's even like the you know like Democrats in Congress they don't wake up in the morning and saying there's tons of people sleeping outside every night and this is America they don't have kids\nToo\nTrying to undermine or criticized like first of all that society can't be vibrant and can never even reform itself\nBut it's ... it's really to revolution in the future but even aside from that um if you don't have that like\nI think there's no hope for improvement in the future I mean the powers that be don't wake up in the morning and like you know there's even like the you know like Democrats in Congress they don't wake up in the morning and say there's tons of people sleeping outside every night and this is America they give\nTo blank blank they don't care they don't care they may care and some abstract way but they don't care like the way you care like when your bills are like unpaid\nLike you care it's so that's up to people you know that's up to us to raise hell and uh and call their attention to this stuff otherwise nothing's ever gonna get better ever honestly it's like a satirist and\nI'm not saying this about myself although self interested I mean I'm a fan of this of this medium that I'm In and has an endless potential and we can you imagine for example\nIf like say powerful media outlets like NPR and the New York times and CBS News\nPut like people who were like on the far left critiquing society on the air and in print in drawings routinely it would broaden the conversation and it would just on the far right\nBy the way and it would just allow the full spectrum of ideas to be exposed and discuss in fact but instead we're in this like really narrow congested band of self censored bland middle of the road DNC deal sea centrist corporate is\nNot good for society it's not even really good for say the Democratic primary for these media outlets I guarantee you the print media wouldn't be as much trouble today if it was wasn't as boring I Can't [noise]\n\nYou live in this phase two from from the inside the mind of the political
