sense of celebration this evening because this is the first time that I had been able to read from this new book with a copy of it in my hands and pleased that you are here to join me in that celebration this book it was in a way a gift to me a from\nA wonderful editor at beacon press who one day it said to me\nWould you like to write a short book about anything [noise]\nAnd I said yes [noise]\nAnd immediately felt given the opportunity to work through a set of concerns and questions which had a gun to preoccupy me and which crystallized in the composition\nOf this book a book which also begin was an experience of falling in love [noise] falling in love with the painting at the Metropolitan Museum in New York City I'm going to read you a short section from the opening of this book about\nMy first encounter with this picture and then uh\nI'll tell you a little more and redo another small bit\nA sharp cracking cold day the era of the Upper East side\nFull of rising plumes of smoke from furnaces and streaming laundries exhaust from the tail pipes of idling taxis flapping banners gangs of pigeons they're assumed\nThat goes back from the solidity of the museums columns and heavy doors the wide stairway were even in the cold people are smoking and shifting their chili weight from side to side eating pretzels hunting over blue and white\nPaper cups of coffee I have a back ache I'm travel weary and couldn't matter less\nAnd steaming laundries exhaust from the tail types of idling taxis\nFlapping banners gangs of pigeons their ascent echoes back from the solidity of the museums columns and heavy doors the wide stairway where even in the cold people are smoking and shifting their chili weight from side to side eating pretzels hunting over blue and white\nPaper cups of coffee\nI have a back ache I'm travel weary and couldn't matter less for this whole scene in the crowd and also on the museum steps which seem alive all day with commerce in a hurry with gathering and departures is fused for me\nWith warmth because I have fallen in love with a painting\nThough that phrase doesn't seem to suffice not really rather it's that I have been drawn into the orbit of a painting have allowed myself to be pulled into its fear by casual attraction deepening to something more compelling\nI have felt the energy and life\nOf the paintings will\nI have been held their instructed and the overall effect the result of looking and looking into it's brimming surface as long as I could is love\nBy which I'm In a sense of tenderness toward experience of being held within an intimacy with the things of the world\nThat since has remained with me as I moved out to the dark stone lobby of the museum with its huge vase of flowers looming over the information desk and out into the sudden winter rightness the gray brightness of Manhattan in January on to the museum steps\nThey're stepping outside into the day\nWhere nothing is framed or bounded as things in the museum are\nSuddenly the sense of intimacy and connection I've been feeling flares out as if my painting had been hearth\nA heated and glowing place deep in the museum interior\nAnd I carried the warmth of it with me out into the morning\nIt's MORNING steal the skies a huge crystal cracked and alive with fractures con trails cloudy patches huge distances but nothing seems truly remote to me no chill too intractable because I have stepped\nFrom a warm suspension out into the shattering lead cold air something of that suspension remains within me around me is the medium in which I and my fellow citizens\nMove we are all moving just now\nIn the light that has come toward me the canvas the size of a school notebook we are all walking in the light of a wedge of lemon Fort wasters half glass of wine a cluster of green gripes with a few curly leaves still attached to their stem\nThis light is enough to reveal us as we are bound together in the warmth and good light of habitation in the good and ... alive enough of us how is it possible\nIt's a simple painting still life with always stirs and lemon\nOne yawn ... the heat him painted in ... some three hundred and fifty years ago and displayed today\nIt was still attached to their stem this light is enough to reveal us as we are bound together in the warmth and good light of habitation in the good and ... alive enough of us how is it possible\nIt's a simple painting\nStill live with always stirs and lemon by one yawn ... the heat him painted in ... some three hundred and fifty years ago and displayed today after who knows what places it has been in a glass case at the metropolitan lines flat\nSo that when Ben's and looks down into its Brahms the auto no atmosphere\nIt is an atmosphere the light lovingly delineating these things is warm a little fog encompassing tender ambient\nAs is added to the fragrance invoked by the sharp poll by the lemon and the acidic wine and the salty marsh scent of the oysters were some fragrance the light itself carried\nSimple\nAnd yet so firm in its assertions I'll Try to name them\nThat this is the matrix in which we are held the generous light binding together the fragrant and flavorful productions of vineyard marsh an orchard\nThat the pleasures of what can be tasted and smells are to be represented framed set apart that pleasure is to be honored\nThat the world is a dialogue between degrees of transparency Globes of the grapes the wine in the glass equally penetrated by light but ever so slightly less clear than the vessel itself\nI Can't recall only the reds were all set on the rough surface of the piles stones and the gesture of her hand reaching down into invisibility and coming up with two or three of the little pin wheels and holding them out toward the eager black faces drawing nearer\nAnd soon we were in the car\nAll of us with the windows closed and the tall figure standing around us rocking back and forth a little therefore pause raised in the air their tongues touching their teeth lips and ... was still rummaging in her pocket book saying that must be more in here somewhere ...\nThank you [noise]\n\nYou're joining us at Cambridge for I'm listening to Mark Galeotti discussing on objects and intimacy\nMark I like to ask you about at a section in your book that you didn't read from you write about cleaning the attic and\nCould you talk a little bit about the difference between object the object senior addict and the objects in ... still life or in your grandmother's per se\n\nThe down side of the love of objects and their capacity\nTo hold memory and to suggest feeling is the problem of where to put them and the uh impossibility for some of us of letting go of things which contain elements of our history so I Am embarrassed to\nOwn an attic which is the over stuffed\nGroaning brain of of my house full of the physical evidence of memory which over time has become impenetrable\nThe and occasionally I talk about this and the book that I I decided that it's time to to just sliced some some pathways or bring order to this accumulation and I'm always defeated by the experience of\nWaiting age thing is deciding

perhaps one of the differences with the things in the ad it\nWas a certain glamour to the arrangement of the\nHeap of objects but but I um I just I I Would not um I Would certainly not say that those things\nAre available to anyone else right now nobody else could look at those objects and have a sense of their meaning their history they're emotional resonance and part of the very peculiar power of\nStill alive is to show us\nThese things which are fundamentally impersonal right that that those aren't are lemons or our gripes but in the way that they are seeing they are capable of conveying feeling they invited us\nTo bring to them our own robberies our own emotional experience as if art has served as a way of of translating the residents of the image for the reader\n[noise] for the viewer\nFundamentally the difference between\nSelf expression riding in one's journal scribbling a sketch of a few objects for oneself and the difference between completing a work of art is awareness of audience does it not\nIs shaping some things so that it can be received by another person the mediating power of yawned again allows us to have an experience with these things which is fundamentally not his\nIt's ours belongs to each of us\nThere was a remarkable painter I'm a Adrian ... whose whose work are discussing the book who specialized in the portrayal\nOf single objects a

to form that\nKind of bridge between maker and viewer between writer and reader\nI think that meeting ground is is uh that's as as close as I could come to identifying a sacred space and that is why I think\nWhen in the first piece that I read for you when I describe walking out of the museum and seeing all the people all the strangers on the steps of the museum\nTenderly that is why the painting\nHas produced the opportunity to enter into a kind of space of reverence a U.S base of tenderness towards the world a space of regard\nSo I\nThink to the future from our consumer society
