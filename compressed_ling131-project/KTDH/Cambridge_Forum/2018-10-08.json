definitive welcome to Cambridge for them very badly [noise]\n\nWe're gonna talk a little bit about a a Marco Polo tonight and all of this is a book which takes place mostly in the thirteenth century the deeper I got into it during my own for your journey in search of\nMarco Polo on his travels the more it seems to me that this was in in a bleak way really a book about today and uh and Marco Polo was world although it seems so far away and so removed from us in time and in language and custom um by by the end it seemed to me was not really\nThat different and I'm going to try and explain to you why and that I think we can find keys to many a global problems in ... terms that we're facing\nIn this very very complex and many chamber book I'm now people weren't sure really until the nineteenth century about much of what Marco Polo said what was fact or was it fiction in fact he was taken him to be a fabulous that was popular\nTraveled genre at the time he wrote and assume that it was assumed that Marco Polo and partly because of his embellish mints and partly because of people's expectations was doing the same thing in fact he was writing a travelogue and sort of a super charged travelogue Marco Polo actually didn't write these travels he dictated them to a ghost writer\nNamed rush the cello who came from pisa Russian shallow was in\nA romance writer ... and he uh road\nAs Marco Polo dictated to him when they were both in a jail in general well actually it was really a ... a lot so when they were kept their as captives 'em over a period of perhaps a year and uh then afterwards Marco Polo Maine we think made changes\nSort of a super charged travelogue Marco Polo actually didn't write these travels he dictated them to a ghost writer named rush the cello who

were kept their as captives\n'em over a period of perhaps a year and uh then afterwards Marco Polo Maine\nWe think made changes and corrections in addition to this manuscript keep in mind this was before\nThe invention of a movable type in Western Europe so manuscripts were the only way to go and on top of all that um there are dozens of Marco Polo manuscripts early ones maybe as many as a hundred and yet there's no one authentic original manuscript\nAnd they're drastically different from one another not just in language not just because one's in Gaelic and one's in Tuscan and one's in and French and then others in Latin um summer twice as long as others and some very different stories from others I'm On like\nOur idea of an explorer he did not decide to go explore China and I don't know how many times I rent that ran that Marco Polo discovered China he he was one of many countless emerges from\nNot only all over Europe but uh all over or what we call the middle east who are taking some branch of what we now call the Silk Road some trail into Asia to trade with the Mongols the Mongols\nUnder the leadership of Genghis Khan who was the grandfather Google Kahn had conquered China and made the Silk Road safer travel\nAnd ... invited westerners like the polls and allow them to train but wanted them to administer his huge far flung empire the Mongols were wonderful warriors and they were fabulous on horseback\nThey were able to ride a horse at a full Gallup facing backward and fire arrows one after another against their enemies and uh they were able to conquer all of Asia\nAnd a good part of your all the way to the banks of the venue river um it was thought that that time that they would keep going but they stopped there so ... as a result wound up becoming the emperor of loose federation that was the largest land based empire\nIn history yet ah there weren't enough people to administer which is why Europeans like the polo was or many Arabs as well came in handy as tax collectors are particularly and ah and\nJust sort of eyes and ears spies if you will for ... I'm Marcos father and uncle Nikola andme FAO hadn't gone on a trip before him\nAnd a and a ... Khan and he gave them in an order to come back to the capital\nCity which is in the location of Beijing now but it was called CONMEBOL luck with one hundred wise men from Europe he basically wanted to pick their brains for science\nFor any kind of knowledge for military knowledge natural sciences anything you could imagine well they agreed to do that just so they could they could leave but of course they had no idea how to do that instead they brought back there one son Marco who was only Seventeen at the time now they have been gone for sixteen years\nWhen they returned to Venice from their first trip without him so he was virtually a stranger to them and vice versa and after a brief time in Venice they brought him along as the son who really didn't know who they were on the second

trip which is the one that was immortalized\nIn the book and the one that Marco much later in prison wrote about a but he went as a kid and he went because his uncle and father drank um their um otherwise he would have spent his life and some part of a of Venice and uh as as a merchant of Venice which is what he eventually became\nWhen he returned however this proved to be the most extraordinary uh education experience that anybody ever having had in Marco Polo came of age on the Silk Road um with all its hardships and all its rigors\nUm travel at that time was agonizing Lee slow you either went on foot or on horseback or by donkey cart as occasionally sale but that was extraordinarily dangerous and\nUh people avoided the water at all costs to boats were very unsafe 'em and Margo had some you know near brushes himself on his on the way home so the it was it was considered safer to go over land but it took years at least three years but\nSometimes to four or five years to get all the way from Venice to Beijing or\n... so it was a very very serious undertaking to do this wind and people go they went to get rich\nUm they went to ... let them train on the side and as soon as they hit Afghanistan they could begin trading and rubies and other precious stones 'em and later on and spices and silk and other fabrics they were an endless number of things to be traded in in um skilled merchants liked the\nActually didn't transfer easily to Western Europe\nThey had to be invented all over again the printing press being the best example Gutenberg invented the printing press several hundred years after the Chinese and printing\nNow it was not the same kind of printing 'cause there's too many Chinese characters the Chinese printing was more like a stem cells or blocks nevertheless it was a you know it's our definition of printing [noise]\nIn the nineteenth century uh when ... or other people got into China they realize that mark a lot of what Markopolos said made sense but there was still a persistent\nKind of Contra tradition that Marco Polo didn't go and then he had a borrowed from other travelers he got some extra help inadvertently from his collaborator rusted cello who was only too happy to embellish so if you were looking for things that we're ... we're not true\nThey tended to be the ... from us to shallow but then several things occurred in in in more modern scholarship there was a\nChinese scholar who died recently they've won she'd chew who discovered some Chinese animals that tallied exactly I'm with some elements of Marco Polo story and although he didn't\nName the Palos ... it it described it was such spends his specificity what these three Europeans did end there\nThings that we're ... we're not true they tended to be\nThe interpretations for must've shallow but then several things occurred in in in more modern scholarship there was a\nChinese scholar who died recently they've won she'd chew who discovered some Chinese animals that tallied exactly I'm with some elements of Marco Polo story and although he didn't\nName the Palos ... it it described it was such spent his specificity what these three Europeans did and their missions that could only be Marco Polo furthermore\nUm the leading antagonist if you will Francis was her her arguments have been debunked by\nA a lot of scholars for example just take the most obvious one how could Markopolos\nOn to China and not written about the great wall of China but the answer is quite simple and hadn't\nBeen built yet that was built in the ... dynasty um but at the same thing goes for tea how could have gone to China and not mentioned tea but he did in in in some of the manuscripts he writes about tea um so I could go on you know point by point but you sort of get the general drift\nYou traveled to write this book you traced Markopolos route you talk about that did you walk into the donkey cards and three years for how did you how did you travel and what did you learn by re chasing that\nRoute um this subject is so vast that one can easily spend twenty four years like Marco trying to reach racist steps but uh in in my own case because I was trying to to do this book\nIn a regional by the time and keep it a reasonable length um I went I made a one trip to China to drift well going back and forth across the length of China which was a fairly extensive trip than another trip across back and forth Mongolia\nAnother trip to Venice um for more research there\nAnd then the other trips which were just as important or trips to the library um that would be the East Asian library here um the John Carter brown library at Brown university a butler library Columbia University and other um specialized or semi specialized collections and uh\nWhat I did on some of these\nTrips some of it was was sightseeing simply scenes sites that Marco Polo described um and uh it's kind of an island in comparison and often being struck by the similarities sometimes it was meeting scholars who really don't have much of a voice in the west so I was able to mean\nScholars in Beijing and in ... which is the capital of Mongolia and talk with them about their Marco Polo perspectives they not only believe that Marco Polo was there they sort of need Marco Polo was a symbol\nTo be there to validate that part of the world in the eyes of the west and I'll give you an example of what I mean in the past few years the Chinese government has endorsed Marco Polo as an important figure and they were gun erecting big statues\nOf him and there's a very prominent one that uh\nI I'm a visited I'm In ... which was a at one point the capital of some dynasty in China and um it's new and it's very striking to have a statue of a foreigner\nIn the location like that it's almost like having a statue of a foreigner in the Washington ... would you know\nThere would be a very good reason for that statue to be there um so I think the Chinese and this point would like to promote the idea that the Marco Polo went to China and spoke well of China but there's a certain irony there because Marco Polo didn't know that much about China China was strange to him he didn't speak Chinese\nSome dynasty in China and um it's new and it's very striking to have a statue of a foreigner\nIn the location like that it's almost like having a statue of a foreigner in the Washington ... would you know\nThere would be a very good reason for that statue to be there um so I think the Chinese and this point would like to promote the idea that the Marco Polo went to China and spoke well of China but there's a certain irony there because Markopolos didn't\nKnow that much about China China was strange to him he didn't speak Chinese and um he ... he was with the ... he was with the occupying army of the Mongols and it was the Mongols with whom he felt affinity if you read carefully his writings about\nThe so called city of heaven which is our modern day a ... a hung Joe I'm it uh it often baffled\nHim and um he he wrote about it but\nUm it was as he he he was suddenly stepping out and writing as a um as a stranger as an outsider rather than someone who with\nThe Mongols the sense that felt a sense of connection I think that uh come to him through his father and uncle and also through the fact that uh he was a personal envoy of the bungled emperor ...\nI Believe you started saying that there were many parallels to today and you have traveled I asked her if she wanted to say\nMore about that well you know this is sort of in the eyes of a holder and what you make of it but it seemed to me that he was he discovered some universal of a human interaction the fact that Congress seem to kind of cross all political boundaries um the fact that uh the the biggest boundaries that he encountered really we're not um geographical\nOr even political so much as matters of faith\nThat they seem to be the kind of a arbitrary I'm In an changeable lines that that he was dealing with um as a person ups I wouldn't say no faith but changeable faith um Marco was able in his ... million like way to fit into\nA some of these different areas at least temporarily but um you know it was certainly something that was very reminiscent of what's\nOf what's going on today when he talks about Afghanistan and how dangerous it is and all the highly man and the fact that it was the poppy growing center of the world and there are lots of rubies or this is all ... Afghanistan today the very little has changed um and you can find people who live pretty much\nThe same way so it's it's not just that he was looking forward\nAlthough we did that in some ways he was also looking backward or to to um examples of people living in in less in in in more primitive laser simpler ways\nIn Mongolia today it's not that hard to go out of ... and\nFind yourself as I did I'm staying in the ... camp and uh you know seem sites that he that he described and are being transported into a very different world um from what we think of is the president but after a while you start thinking well what is the present any way the president is a\n... where you happen to be so you know that's what I think his focus is so unbelievably rich because it's\nIt's it's almost like a tree rings or you know a layer of ah the earth with different different geological sections um that are still in his book you know they're interacting they're not an art and that that gives it a lot of confusion but a lot of energy\nWas a threat I think many of the questions tonight to I'm asking about ...
