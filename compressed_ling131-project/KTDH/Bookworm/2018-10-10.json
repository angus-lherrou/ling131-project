{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTDH", "content": "... talk this is a opening section from French Exit by my guests Patrick with which is published by echo books and\nI don't know if it's the with has a book previous to this one no two previous um called the sisters brothers that's coming out as the movie will tell Keane Phoenix than John C. blindly and then what do you think of the movie\nI liked the movie very much um I saw recently\nAnd um it's just such a strange experience to witness the re creation of something that was only existing in your head and and are these characters were sort of murky and now they're they're crystal clear for you admire the performance is very much and it looks beautiful and and yeah I I I felt I felt really good and in watching the film\nHelp me John ... had appeared in the movie before this one called Terry Terry with an army at the end that was based upon\nSome of your own collected rising yeah he liked the writing so much that he was given an advance copy of this west during the sisters mothers um and he liked it and before him he was in\nThe movie if this are you one of these people who would vans it'd be making movies in writing novels\nNo absolutely not I think that you know it's my first love fiction and then novels in particular and when I think of my work that's\nThat's where I go in my mind I found that I Do like I'm adapting a fiction my own or somebody else's to the screenplay format there's something about it that I really enjoy I mean my fiction is do die like heavy anyway it sort of a natural fit but my heart will always be with a novel I think\nYou know that's ... ... and that's when I home yeah I was not a Jones\nIs co director of development at which I read screen plays constantly and I can tell you I Would rather read an awful\nAlmost any yeah then the best screenplay unless it's written by Robert Towne Kara Eastman or Charles Eastman of they were my screen writer friends who Dennis all the with what could be done but by in large losses in those three\nI Want to read an awful of course yeah yeah and I want to read in the oval in which you can do is vicious an evil yes that's your connector here gets invented now when I sent to Patrick do it as soon as we sat down was\nDo you know this character\nTo character Francis price I Do not know Francis price I've never met anyone a remotely like or it's more um somebody I've been meaning to address for a long while\n'cause as I told you I Do yes I knew woman no longer among us\nIn which you can do is vicious an evil yes that's your connector here gets invented now when I sent to Patrick do it as soon as we sat down was do you know this character\nTo character Francis price I Do not know Francis price I've never met anyone a remotely like or it's more um somebody I've been meaning to address for a long while\n'cause as I told you I Do yes I knew woman no longer among us but she could be when she wanted to be\nSo vicious and so we see yeah that you really\nYou want to think a certain then addiction and say I got out on my own thank\nGoodness she was known to some as the last woman who knew everything mhm um there were many people who were these characters in novels on her all really so yes because she was such an actual yeah Patrick ... told me\nThat he has friends who tell him that he has a wicked own drew woman inside and yeah yeah what kind of friends tell you this\nI think it's a tough truth and your friends are there to tell you the truth but a a it's a character I've been wanting to get through for some time and I think that it's just a voice that it's certainly a voice that I hear and I don't necessarily\nSpeak it out loud because I wouldn't have these friends and the first place if I told everyone the truth you know but um I just ah yeah it's just a it's somebody who who who has been bubbling up in my mind for a number of years and I finally got to uh to to to realize there with this book\nIs this book as opposed to the sisters brothers and under major ... miners write this book clients mhm it's easily written yeah the only thing books\nHad to do a lot of self invention on two major ... minor\nHad to in Santa castle and the village and sub zero temperatures in doors that were very hard to sleep when you were always inventing this feels very natural this right like a dream\nIt really did and I think that's always the trick is to try to make it seem as though it had but typically doesn't mean under major do my minor was horrific to write and um I was very late turning it in and and I was just sort of ripping my hair out at certain points in the process of writing that book and this one\nBy comparison was was far far simpler and just very well behaved from the moment I sat down to work on it I think the relief I felt that finally addressing this character Francis was so great that there was just a really nice energy and pushed behind me and every day I sat down to work and it was just\nA matter of sort of typing it out almost it took less than a year to get the rough draft\nDid the evil older woman in you come out as a result or get buried more deeply\nWell I think she's a good question I think he's with me for life I Hope that she's with me for life but I Do think that maybe she said it because she had her say you know she said she she spoke in her piece so she's maybe gone back\nThe mark a little bit more than before but there was the feeling of sort of an unveiling at the beginning of working on this book and um you know she was in she lives in in the driver's seat at last and and it was pleased to be now\nTo come out as a result or get buried more deeply\nWell I think she's a good question\nI think he's with me for life I Hope that she's with me for life but I Do think that maybe she said it because she had her say you know she said she she spoke in her piece so she's maybe gone back into the mark a little bit more than before but there was the feeling of sort of an unveiling at the beginning of working on this book\nAnd um\nYou know she was in she was in in the driver's seat at last and and it was pleased to be now what was it funded killer no oh and this is something that I always struggle with\nUsually the end of a book something bad happens to somebody that you care about is sort of an inevitability and\nI'm as with the sisters brothers say you know Charlie has a rough time at the end and I I I cared for the character of Charlie so much by the end of it I didn't want to hurt them but it was necessary and it was the same with with Francis price here where things don't work out for at the end than it and it felt\nEarned and it felt necessary but the scenes where where I'm just sad fate but fall is er\nIt's unpleasant to to to address these things\nYou don't just kill her you kill her yeah I mean this is not going to be someone who's going to be coming back from the dead you know she has a husband who's\nPart in a little cat and [laughter] and is reached my sands in the course of this novel yeah but Francis is did to us all\nOn the end of this book did did you feel that if you didn't saucer\nThat you'd have to revive her\nNo I don't think I was thinking that far ahead Malcolm says something and and and he's speaking with a a French policemen after after ... death and the placement is trying to figure out why Frances would do such a thing and he said that it was an aesthetic choice [laughter]\nAnd that just summed it up for me you know that sort of a throwaway line but I think that would have been her motivation I prefer this to the other\nYou know well the book is full of her through my mind is yeah life is the lottery is another one of them [laughter] that must have been part of fun yeah\nYeah I mean the the bans are particularly between Francis and Malcolm was just a great joy because they just had so much to say to each other and their points of view are still caustic\nYet humorous you know I'm happy to hear that you like spending time with awful people because often time readers don't necessarily agree and I adore awful people in my fiction or as a reader and in and and as a writer as well too so it was just nice to engage with you know the full viciousness of these people\nWell I have to say that perhaps I was trained in this by an English novelist named the Compton brunette yeah and hurt you you you're smiling\nYou after Oh absolutely yeah yeah and she she's almost sort of I think if I thought I was thinking of her a few different people but I was definitely thinking of of ... in writing this book\nShe loved it yeah she loved it as far as her explanation the course of one of her novels for incensed yeah she has the character says will wastes not one of them [laughter]\nI'm Michael silver blunt and you're listening to bookworm from the studios of KCRW I'm Talking with ... which about his new novel French Exit will continue after this short
