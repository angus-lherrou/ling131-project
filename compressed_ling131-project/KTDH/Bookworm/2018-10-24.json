{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTDH", "content": "Well the idea actually came in a single moment and and when it came I knew\nIt was going to end in tragedy at the Oakland Coliseum I didn't know how it is going to come together and how they were all going to connect um and that comes from\nUm how I feel about life I mean it's sort of like a dark comedy um and a tragedy so uh\nI didn't want to just like write something horrific and that did not end well but\nThe way things have gone in the way things seem to be going is not a happy picture so doesn't feel true to me or try to write something that has a nice ball in the end or um it was always going to end that way with the from the first\nSecond I thought of a thought of it I just didn't know how I Would pull it off how to get there\nIt was always going to end that way whether it's from the first second I thought of a thought of it I just didn't know how to pull it off\nHow to get there I'm Talking to Tommy orange the author of their their it's\nA nice surprise because we're hearing about people we don't hear about in fiction but this I don't just mean Native Americans I mean people who've spent their whole lives\nLearning to be a nurse\nAnd then got fired from the nursing job and having to figure out\nHow to raise the whole family because these are not families by and large where a mother is with her children this is the new community\nThis is the community of people who have to rediscover one another those who aren't being saved my other relatives\nAre joining together just selling drugs or commit thefts but everyone has to find a way to live because there's no choice we're here we're stumped to whatever ends us and somehow or other\nWe're going to get something to eat but at the end of the day fair means or fell\nYeah I mean uh I worked in the ... community for many years and that this is often the case I think the generation um\nThere's a generation that was hit hard by by the effects of history and couldn't you know there was no there was never going to be some happy nuclear family story um\nThe way things happened and it you know I could just being in the community and knowing families and seeing how things when um\nIt was a consistent thing where the conventional family structure was not there and for reasons that seems clear to me but not a lot of people can understand the way history works overtime\nYou pointed out that these are urban Indians and that they don't have their own books yet you've written one of the first books\nAnd for urban drifters of well Klein says\nThere are things in this book that I've never seen in a book before um this is the first book I've read where those guns that are made of plastic and manufactured by three D printers\nThat this is the first time I've seen these guns in a novel\nAnd handled by young people who are taking the guns to community powwow in other words these are Native American young people who are ready to run their own people\nNow I'm move we use or drinks fiction and non will vote as pleasant but they're always is something of a pastoral exotic\nKind of beautifully inventive fields what you're doing seems to be in the arm period of the imagination\nAs in like it's a little more CD seed in impoverished uncertain of what the right thing would be yeah these are people who are choosing tank these are people who don't seem to know how to act like they haven't been given that option\nThese aren't people who are choosing tank ... these are people who don't seem to know how to act like they haven't been given that option that's a luxury mhm I\nThink uh and I think up so much of fiction is filled with like upper middle class narratives and as a how often have I read you know somebody who's a janitor or you know somebody who wants to find belong in sort of\nFinds it in you know criminal activity it's it's just\nIt's something that I Know from where I grew up in and different things I experienced and why doesn't belong in literature wise and have been in literature and I don't know that I have the answer but I certainly know that it doesn't belong\nI'm Michael silver ... you're listening to a bookworm from the studios of KCRW I'm Talking with Tommy orange about his book there there will continue after this short break\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm Michael ... book worm and I'm Talking with Tony orange about his book there is there a study a story of ... urban Indians whose lives in ...\nAt the big Oakland pound well now I say the big Glenn how well but that's a construct right there isn't a big ...\nAnd there's there's been a very different small ones throughout the bay area over time and I've been on a committee that put went together nothing on the scale of what I made up a there are that\nThe big ones in stadiums at different parts of the country that I was you know basing it on it's it's not going to complete fabrication but there's nothing like that in Oakland\nWell you mentioned a janitor and that he belongs in fiction I got a letter and I'm hoping the person who committed is listening I got a letter from a listener who\nSent Michael I'm a janitor\nI dropped out of high school I didn't go to college I never liked English class but I've been listening to your show\nAnd once I'm not sure why I picked up one of the books you were talking about\nAnd then the process I made friends with the guy who owns the used bookstore in my town we read these books together now I never would have dreamt was possible but I Am a reader because of your show\nAnd so you know getting the men who like that where you putting characters wouldn't normally be in fiction into your book these are\n... these are ... and that's our job here on earth to help others have the things that allowed us to stay alive for me that was reading that was books\nAnd uh I don't know what it was that didn't click with me I'm reading you know I wasn't a good student and you know they sort of regular or than what teachers would say it's like he's not applying himself or whatever\nI wasn't a good student and you know they sort of regular or than what teachers would say it's like he's not applying himself or whatever um that I read certain books along the way and\nI never caught whatever it is when you realize how meaningful reading and particularly fiction for me for whatever reason that it didn't happen for me until you know I was\nTwenty four ... ah maybe about twenty four years old when I was working at a used bookstore and and there was a single moment where the novel particularly or something and it just clicked and um and I realized like oh this is this is what novel in is and it was it was about a hundred pages into confederacy of dances um\nI was on a break from from the used bookstore and I was eating a doughnut and reading ... and it's sort of a perfect a combination of events and that was the moment there was there was another moment with Sylvia Plath and the bell jar and she was doing something with the image of the bell jar\nAnd it was just the most profound thing to me and I I just didn't know you could do I mean that's the thing about reading and fiction and people who don't know they love it\nUm you can do something with consciousness and with thinking and I think you know writing a novel is another way of thinking of like a better way of thinking ... said that similar um\nJust something wakes up in that you didn't know it was possible at that's what I Love about reading and how it explores consciousness and um how much it can do with that I don't in some ways will never be able to really express what it's doing\nThe first novel that made me want to read novels was Alice in wonderland and through the looking glass why because I was sick and tired of people talking sense to me I wanted to hear nonsense", "show_name": "Bookworm", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "24"}
