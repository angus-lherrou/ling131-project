applying for them\nAnd so you were changing be these models\nInto the middle of the ... were were toned we can have nothing to say because we don't know what one well\nI think the key is to get to know people well enough to to write about the you know\nNothing to say because we don't know well\nI think the key is to get to know people who held enough to the right about the you know I mean that's the key I think a lot of writing that you know it was off tone is basically somebody projecting their ideas about what somebody of a difference of any different I mean it could be you know sexual orientation or gender or race ...\nEven class obviously you know you could tell that it's somebody who was almost coddling together a bunch of a character from a bunch of stuff here he is seen in the TV or whatever but for me everything is very journalistic if I don't spend time with characters I mean\nThere is a kind of Brooklyn out there that I met and and I I did not have you know that they've gotta relations with other buried that but um I could almost sort of hypothesize what would happen to be seen to bury type person in uh Brooklyn type person based on meeting both types of people's\n... first of all about his new book like success in a novel published by Random House and I saw that chapter was the most exciting the best chapter in the book because it was saying to me\nMichael look at how you're sitting up expecting him to take a full look at how you're expecting him to swarm dies or ... wrong I was sure that this chapter couldn't work today\nAnd so I was reading it with great care because this might be as difficult as some of the chapters and uncle very thin and for people to accept me love uncle Murray thin Lee ... for having written Huckleberry Finn but it's the calm mhm\nA subject for controversy here and here in lake success I think that this relationship\nIs more controversial than berries relationship to his autistic son in what they cruising autistic spectrum that money has succeeded quite\nYes yes and strangely enough I'm somebody got in touch with me and said that based on my son because there's somebody who had a very similar journey to she though who is that you have to stick fun in the book\nSo well you know since science and the privilege of knowing painful on every part of that spectrum more or less including the genius spectra\nGeniuses who are so brilliant as they can start talking because they know so much more than you were ... they have so much more to tell us than we know we need to know\nUm it there's no point at which the Otis humming once is ... with the autistic stops\nBeing wants to ... it's only\nUse an extraordinary revelation of what it can be like to be human\nAbsolutely in a very different way to be human and I think you know I think for somebody like Barry who himself at all the diagnosis was being on the spectrum but he's somebody who started out life not\nPicking up social cues from peers so he developed this idea of friend moved where it's like a computer program for when we were young you know basic sub routines if then if somebody says Hi I say this you know [noise] um so I think for him\nYou know there's um and he's also ... and his kid is non verbal so that puts another huge monkey wrench in in in ...\nGrew up very did looking into myself in the mirror seeing if his\nAnother huge monkey wrench in in in ...\nHe grew up buried did looking at a nuisance in the mirror seeing if his moves Merce adoptive enough to earn friends\nWell I have to say this is something that I mean I I don't think I'm On the spectrum but I grew up you know not knowing English and so I spent a lot of time in the mirror practicing both English and hand\nGestures of ... and I grew up in some unions I was seven and and so just try to get that stuff right uh so you know when you ask where did Barry come from I think with every author berry also every character you develop has something to do with you obviously nothing is create out of whole cloth\nNothing is created in Islam cause and you can't I think you can't help it you can write this character Barry better if your name is Gary\n... well that's why we switch that you know it's and and whenever I write about people who have some real life equivalence until the very last draft I Will use their name that I'll switch it out because that's by way of of of remembering who they are and making sure that their personality and fuses every line I write\nOff the books so far\nIt's the most Sanders and it's the most melancholy book it's the most even though the characters are combing Barry song was an ... was it is\nA ... and ... says he recognizes and as we read we recognize that too and it's not that we feel sorry for him but we want to send him a\n... message ah um and and feel vent his you know he's schemes to\nFund the unfunded and educate the an educated are not going to do as well as saying hey you know you this morning what's your name and what are you doing on on the streets this time with no place to sleep you know we all need to learn yeah the ...\nI mean ... you're living in in New York where people\nLeft in mind has no place to go\nAnd I think you know I mean berries is the point of one percent but I think his lays represents the ... of all the middle and upper classes I mean in some ways he just\nDoesn't understand the world the thrust into it and and here I used a narrow divisive put him on the greyhound bus a but he's thrust into it or he flounder if he doesn't know quite what to do um\nThe good stuff comes up but all the bad stuff to you know and you mentioned Brooklyn he goes through periods of loving are but then worried that he she's about to steal all his watches which of course she doesn't do so all seems\nToo but what she did sensitively was put the launches in saying she\nThinking about what a black woman who doesn't know would do\nNever for a moment things she saved his valuables he thinks she's strong watches and when he sees his room he sees is not just wrong in this case he's wrong all the time\nHe keeps saying over and over again um you know I Am a Republican but I'm socially liberal and fiscally conservative that is monitoring but at that moment I think the Brooklyn other moments the to kinda conflate and you realize that being fiscally conservative in his case\nIs not being socially liberal it it's actually being anything but he can fleets these two things race in class and expectations and it becomes a disaster for him and I think he realizes at that point\nBut there's no you know I don't believe [noise] I don't believe in full on Hollywood style redemption\nAnd then they think he realizes at that point\nBut there's no you know I don't believe [noise] I don't believe in full\nOn Hollywood style redemption I Believe in incremental steps toward something and then stepped back you know I think we're all in this endless escalator we're trying to scramble up and maybe we get halfway up or a\nThird Weber two thirds up or maybe we fall down completely that happens to a lot of us too and I I Want to ... to be this constant scramble up that escalate\nI'm Michael ... you're listening to bookworm from the studios of case there W.
