fire in the arms of a handsome fire him and this for a young man who just deployed and failed to become a member of the Santa Monica fire fire department so he had a certain thing for firemen and well\nYou know before long she gets cast in the room of chief suspect\nHad it in incredible desire for attention and I think most of his films and fabrications were designed to make it\nTension and I think most of his films and fabrications were designed to make it seem like his life was much more exciting than it was most of us I think would understand even if we wanted attention that you don't want attention for committing\nA massive destructive felony like an arson fire\nAnd yet he can facts not only to his friends but to the fire department as well that he had done it and and then only when the seriousness of what he was saying I think really dawned on him\nWhen he got arrested yes and taken to jail he had no idea that you could be arrested for just doing it\nRight to exactly I think that it was it shocked him and ... you know you would think somebody with oh it was a bit more sensible would say you know you don't it's like you don't joke around about bombs when you're at the airport\nWhen there's been a huge fire in the city you live and you don't both to people that you started it\nWhen I was a boy my mom's favorite book was a tree grows in Brooklyn and in the book for heroin France he wants to read all\nOf the books in her branch library and she read some of them for medical water well I tried that too 'cause we had a very small branch library was just a small storefront a person could conceivably read the books you know for about a quarter so this book\nThe library book by Susan Orlean\nIs phones so many things that are so close to my heart but I read it really overnight it's a wonderful book on top of it you know the way they talk about him Mr erupted in ...\nIt's a mystery story to know I'm not going to tell you whether or not the mystery get solved um ... what every thing that can be done\nSusan Orleans drawn she finds the young man Harry is his name he she ... sisters she talks to them you know this if she were to solve this mystery\nOf the probably the biggest catastrophe LA has ever known she would be world famous [laughter]\nUm I ended up learning a lot about our son\nWhich is in itself a fascinating topic and it is an incredibly difficult thing to investigate our son it's the least successfully\nProsecuted felony it destroys the evidence it's in a way it's not that I'm recommending it but it is a perfect crime it's one of those things where you the weapon itself can be destroyed in the\nConflict ration so there is often no evidence at all and in the case of a fire that burned for seven hours at temperatures\nOver two thousand degrees you can imagine how difficult it was to investigate\nLa ... vacated and stood outside many of them and tears the farm and could only spend ten minutes in rotation before they had to leave and the terrible heat and\nWhat an extraordinary scene is is to imagine\nAnd the terrible heat and what an extraordinary scene is is to imagine because downtown Los Angeles\nComes and goes and comes and goes geographically it's now you know you know one of its high periods right people are living there again but then\nI Would say in the mid eighties it was really in a low point and the businesses a lot of businesses had to laugh because um there are a lot of vacancy down there and\nThere was even a question of whether there was any point in having a library downtown there weren't a lot of people living downtown there really was a feeling that LA had hollowed out in the middle and there wasn't much life in the center of the city\nI'm Michael ... you're listening to book where I'm from the studios of KCRW I'm Talking with Susan or lean about her fabulous book the library book will continue after this short break\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nI'm Michael silver blood this is bookworm and I'm Talking with Susan Orlean about her book for library book which examines the central Los Angeles public\nLibrary fire disaster could test your feet and explores Wong appreciating the cultural concept of my breweries the kinds of people who become librarians are libraries themselves after wrong\nThere are things worse than fires\nCulture itself our library stone libraries ... are they still places now the books can be\nEasily gotten on your computer\nAnd it it's been a debate over the last say ten or Twenty years ever since the existence of the Internet and ultimately the development of electronic books and so forth which is\nIs there a meaning to a library is there a purpose do we need them or can we simply get what we need on line and\nI Would say the answer is around dang yes we need them and you want them\nAnd one of them and feel\nEmotionally connected to them and the thing that interests me see I have many friends who chose to go to ... school\nAnd yes library school is no longer\nThe place it once was for the book ... you know those people who could tell you the books are those in Little Women in Joe's boys single men that leads the male ... road they can tell you what her father wrote the book experts no\nInformation experts and how information is communicated and how we store it we retrieve it\nAnd what's interesting and I think part of the way that\nMission is communicated and how we store it we retrieve it\nAnd what's interesting and I think part of the way that librarian ship has been reinvented is it's the idea of information coupled with a sense of social service or the idea that\nThere is a huge amount of information in the world and in any library there is a vast amount of information how do you get it and how do you help people access\nThe knowledge that a library has so I think there's been I'm happy to say it seems like there's a giant revival in interest in being a librarian\nIt's changed a lot it's attracting younger people it's attracting of a mixture of men and women where's for a very long time it was had become a female profession for whatever reason\nOf female profession ... city or a brewery in so called was fairly consistently and eccentric ... yet adventure\nThere seem to be a a lot of men running libraries whereas most\nOf the staff was female and LA had an occasion that I wrote about at length because it was so fascinating of LA\nHad women running the library early on which was unusual and they had a lot of one or two from\nSuffrage us some feminist people who've
