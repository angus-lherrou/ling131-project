to visit rocketing now it was once the capital of ISIS territory in Syria but it was captured nearly a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nOn to the soccer stadium right in downtown rock uh this is the stadium that ISIS use to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nBoth Steve a rocket seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the streets are pretty clear clean water is widely available no some electricity is coming back there what's really interesting is a lot more shops are open is kinda bustling in a way but what's curious is\nThe shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIs sort of a skeleton of a building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they said there were more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need\nFor health officials say they need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water pure electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYou know a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes\nYou'll drive the street so look completely ... from the damage from the air strikes an ISIS blowing building up and you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand\nDamage from the air strikes ISIS blowing buildings out and you see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're trading sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria\nRight and there was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cuts that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Rocco searches bomb removal and also education programs and that really worried a lot of people\nAnd it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs for living resentment will grow\nPeople become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass round so um there's a concern that I just to continue to come back if the rebuilding effort doesn't continue\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThis is Ninety One point five ... eighty nine point three Katie da da da na ... point seven KGAN Hayes a service of

years ago the G ... epidemic swept across Brazil as a result thousands of babies were born with microcephaly or I'd normally small had among other and parents that come with that\nAround the same time DDT producer William Kramer had a child of his own who was also born with microcephaly although not because of the guy\nCramer wanted to know how Brazil's so called ... babies were developing so we went down and producer radio documentary called seek a love story among the people he met where you're ... she had a support group for parents called United mothers of angels\nYou ask them about their own own thinking how not to ... to get him out of whom I gave us two options either be a victim and don't do anything or become a protectionist into the lives of these kids\nI talked with a million Kramer about his reporting earlier this week can you introduce science to the women you met you go to ... to try to follow up on the children who were born out of this week a crisis and you meet this network of mother\nYeah that's right I mean it was a remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was a um they were very very big you know there were very tight group loss of solidarity\nVery determined women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning [noise]\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us so it's a ... a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about ... to just well which is kind of common for special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of that group which is called the ... mothers of angels\nUh this is a group in ... states which is just sort of\nIt's a one of the Texas was was affected by the ... the leader of that group ... as far as and she is you know really quite a powerful personality uh she doesn't mince words you

a look and you sort of just stopped talking a but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic and paid ... ... people have sought to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the how static of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible pragmatists that their children may not even survive beyond a year so I'm ... how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died\nMost of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of his children probably died very turned off the bus\nOr a few of them are ... things I checked infections for three breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand there are children who are actually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things that I could meet him I said\nThey they were very mixed group of children so there was some children you can walk to can stand there is some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind ... is it you know at the at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achieve into that told me that that much much more um you know just save old\nSome of the children who were more physically disabled or actually talking to the left side and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around\nIt's an incredibly mixed thing\nSo much so that you actually tell the story of twins or a girl who was born with ... and her brother did not matter of fact it\nYeah it was you had this fragile little ... minutes of it to her as she was called a she really couldn't move very much so she seemed very aware of what was going on around her but then she had had twin brother who turned off him who he was acting just like you would expect it to an offer a boy to act [noise]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know that kind of thing um so they don't really understand they didn't know why it affected one twin and another ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that\nSome people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the cap\nYou write that the affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nWhat I saw that the family to a really thinking about the social aspect so while they're largely going to be like like [noise] what school are they going to go to ... and how would they be able to accept the school um will ... be able to go back in and work again what they can about child care and and\nSo we were able to join um the the actress ... so she went
