S. presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent the packages\nWell the whole phenomenon of the pipe bomb or does it surprises me in a poor me but um if you were to say that\nKitchen well the whole phenomenon\nOf the pipe bomb or was it surprises me in a poor me but um if you were to say that somebody was to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wants to attack and I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is\nThe single most important normal politician I'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tells about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen fifty to a well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary and so his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation of his country and he survived by separating from his family and I think that trauma explains a lot about the focus of its finance or in his politics and they live\nAnd he left hungry at Seventeen to go to London and from that he went into finance he moved to New York he opened one of the very early hedge fund in New York was a very successful stock market trader so that by around Nineteen eighty\nHe was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties nineties\nAccounts basically had to currency secularization make him rich well\nI'm In the nineties a specialty whereas a currency peg than looked unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England\nCouldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark and when tourist is right or the pound collapse are made enough food for sure and the u._k. economy are descended into chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIt began in his native Hungary and then in other Eastern European countries where his ... he had a clear political process which was to build for our lives and so he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties own words but\nThe switch came in two thousand tree when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War\nThere once it became clear in two thousand four\nQuite how much money he was spending on demographic get out the vote causes the with the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans a and it became a useful trick\nIf you are being attacked in the major and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the major slurring me but credit sort of ... and his allies have put them up to it\nWhy does George Soros and particularly become scene at the shadowy figure hiding and talked to is it just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as a shadowy you caught expanding rushing the birth actually hits for them to be a cool the open society Institute He's very open about it he ... about where that donation go so I think it's hard to escape the suspicion that the critics who say he\nShot every I'm a natural ring on a long tradition of anti Semitism where George finances are portrayed as the shadowy Ficre to manipulate the politicians and therefore I think it's a fairly clear indication of that tradition\n[noise] well what do people in his native hungry thinks or\nHe was a hero early on in the transition away from communism think of times more recently because of the anti migration populist nationalism that have taken over the country\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of several books in a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations thank you so much sign to President Trump is headed to Charlotte North Carolina today too\nSeveral books in a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations thank you so much so I think\nPresident Trump is headed to Charlotte North Carolina today to rally supporters for Republican congressional candidate mark Harris\nHarris it's gotten a tight race in a former Republican stronghold against Democrat Dan McCready NPR's Kelsey Snell has more on how major shifts in North Carolina politics mirror changes across America\nFor more than fifty years voted in the ninth congressional district in North Carolina have been sending Republicans to Congress\nBut things are changing this year Harris a conservative Baptist minister is slipping in the polls behind mccready a Democrat and former marine David the Clinton a professor of political science at Meredith College said the Trump rally is something that Republicans have to fight harder than there used to\nThe fact that President Trump is coming from a farm or the silk fee that writes was ... it would have been feasible two decades ago for a Republican president me become into that district\nNick Clinton said because of shifting demographics people from other states and other countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham and Charlotte young generations of farmers are doing it to he does like the rest of America Democrats in North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you go\nYou look at the political fine but I mean you can almost see the calorie law and the shift between the Democratic signs were on one side of the county law and then you move into another county more rural county and all of a sudden it's Trump country\nThe line isn't so clear in other areas like Polk County where the view of the political trend line depends on who you ask county commissioner ray Gasper sense as the area is about sixty percent Republican but he's the only elected Democrat\nAnd when you see just party dominating in statewide offices in the future that doesn't mean the entire state and turning blue\n... hundred and ... and ... to ... or ... rule which for him to go much more Republican\n... county Republican chairman diction a seat says rural Republican voters like Trump\nI'm seeing a trend where there's a movement away from the Democratic

costumes\nThere was a controversy on the outside of New York with ... as she got the Diana Ross and like who does she want to look like Diane around for one day I I don't know how like outrageous not hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show line up and that she appeared likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that Megan Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she is in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all you can watch at home than it just is white and she said it was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\nWell these aren't ah the only examples of of their number I remember back in twenty and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claimed that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group black hate group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on though was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal a strategist for about ten minutes who she felt was feeling to take it\nA sufficiently seriously uh one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the ... a former LA up a homicide detective markets farm in on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about ah the question of are African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as as just crediting thing she welcomed him on the show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's a colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah what she thought was the acceptability a black face\nYeah NBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole thing about the controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something about making Kelly's colleagues an attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the weight and that we can handle these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know direction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accused are former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing her I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid\nKelly embraced a sheet accuser foul balls at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that Megan Kelly received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News you just play some popular colleagues\nAnd that whole ratings themselves were
