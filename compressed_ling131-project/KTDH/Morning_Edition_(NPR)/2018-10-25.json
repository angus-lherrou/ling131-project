S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks shop ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Silicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes\nBlocks chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science was talking about watching but at the recent global climate action summit and San Francisco it was all over the place they were an old papers people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nLand use agriculture\nPart of its oil to frustration our\nSome of them and coaches the climate change coalition he came to the conference to spread awareness about blocking [noise] so what is it\nA lot chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] they give it like the ... is like an accounting book\nEveryone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank\nBut it said on the computers of everyone on the block chain transparency is its main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency blocked Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer due endings human trafficking now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... the black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit it kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more economists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the cost\nAnd then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon carbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting nobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting and to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNot a company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because\nHe's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of silicon valley's big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nBecause it before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data with the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and started talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause as watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock a climate scientist at Stanford agree but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something then solvable\nWith a clock ticking on climate change and ... there's no time to waste sorting facts from hike\nFor NPR News I'm

the governor Michael Lee and senior redistricting counsel at the Brennan Center for justice at NYU school of law he said Michigan maps are among the most skewed in the country\nIt's very clear that their number one goal above protecting communities ethnic geographic otherwise er Michigan it's very clear that their number one goal was to maximize Republican political power\nRepublicans have taken the majority of the state's congressional seats nine out of fourteen even in years when Democrats have gotten this far more votes overall\nThe redistricting proposal would create a commission made up

half of those surveyed say their community problems can be sold within five years\nIt is not all a world of hope was that many others are described here is a great deal of optimism that we can deal

S. China's economy\nWas already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost NPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks up ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Silicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind cryptic\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech member station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science\nWas talking about watching\nBut at the recent global climate action summit in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how it could help mitigate climate change in all sorts\nOf agriculture\nHarvest oil to cross racial\nOur sometime in ... the climate change coalition he came to the conferences spread awareness about blocking [noise] so what is it\nA chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger ecosystem of technology\nOkay [noise] think of it like the ... is like an accounting book\nEveryone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank but it said on the computers of everyone on the block chain\nTransparency is the main advantage ... tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... the black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit it kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more economists\nLove this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting and to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNot a company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause he's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nBecause it before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nIs watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agreed but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt doesn't say Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place that stations that are actually more important to make the entire problem something that's how people\nWith a clock ticking

anything for\nBasketball um in in total because what happened here was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on in a big time college athletics and football and particularly in basketball\nFor as long as I can remember and that is basically channeling of money from a one source um to the families of talent\nUm to ensure that that talent goes to a particular school and what has happened over the years in that the uh manufacturers of of basketball shoes Adidas to Nike or those those uh operations\nHas gotten people in the middle of them um to help transfer the money so that the surprise here is that it has been criminalize or by the federal government as opposed to be police\nSo the the surprise here is that it has been criminalize or by the federal government as opposed to be policed by uh the NC double A. is it's been done for years\nAnd it used to be that the worst thing that would happen in this situation is that

that was the way that the federal government decided to get involved in this basically they said that the your universities were being defrauded 'em by the system ah because by funneling that's money\nUm two players are players families um these people knew that they were making these players in eligible under NCWA rules and therefore that at some point\nIt would all be found out and they wouldn't be allowed to play to the universities that have given them scholarships\nAnd therefore they had to fraud in the universities of of value\nWhich is a very strange thing to me because I still
