President Trump clearly believes that politicizing the Kavanaugh hearing is a good idea based on his comments last night do Republican leaders agree Republican leaders are still trying to convince undecided Republicans and even some Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh and this kind of conversation that kind of the exact opposite of what they are trying to deal\nAnd I think she'll probably also

point out that the president has made clear that he takes this personally that he and he has a personal connection with allegations and he says what he believes to be false allegations of sexual misconduct\nAnd that is playing a role in the way that he's responding to all of this and Republicans took great pains to not criticized Christine Blasey Ford even going so far as to say\nShe's credible right they are gone they're gone out of their way to create a paper trail and to kind of make\nThe case that they are listening to forward and they're going through all the appropriate steps

President Trump could abuse the system NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nBack in the days of the Cold War it was pretty common to hear this announcement on TV or radio you know the one this station is conducting a test of the emergency broadcasting system\nThings have gotten a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so and broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon to but today you'll also be getting an alert on your cell phone\nHas some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this is the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing system make sense\nI think having a testing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president to be able to speak directly to the war\nBut this is where Dr Read lender had some qualms especially he says when it comes to this president\nWe showed her to think that the president might be using such a shift though for political purposes or can create a diversion if he felt the presidency without a threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real sure it'd be something like that about it but there is an hour is that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing that system known as wireless emergency alerts or W E s the suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes that wants to turn people cell phones into government loud speakers that compel listening\nFamous says that accusation is baseless\nIn a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official conceded while there is no opting out of the alert system is very well governed

EDITION from NPR News I'm students get and I'm Rachel Martin it is Nobel Prize week so far no belts have been handed out for physics and medicine and today it's chemistry the royal Swedish Academy of scientists announced the winters in Stockholm\nOr whatever you don't talk to me and ordered all this stuff to let you know from the vent decision\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate to us we didn't know who won\nSo half of the award went to France it's Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution\nAnd so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness to the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right there in time to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quote somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties she started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and\nThen you could screen those to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display use of the virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including anti bodies that's what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies there's all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from of NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel ours are actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a a discussion you've heard around this particular product to yeah there's a question\nAbout whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean Francis Arnold is only the fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years um the prize can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that

everything turning white\nAs a fresh started and certainly move all the north Koreans\nSeemingly Hampton Sides says MacArthur forces recaptured South Korea's capital\nAnd he began to get kind of greedy\nThe new book on desperate ground examines the plan that pick Arthur devised next\nWhy stop there why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula under one democratic government\nMcCarthy's troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south\nBut what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans the threat and a huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe that because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he swept this information under the rug what\nWas the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name is general Oliver Smith\nRealize that this was a perfect scenario for and circle meant he was very precious and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen\nOn the shores of this frozen lake in the mountains of North Korea sounds like it was pretty cold eighty five percent of these men suffered from frostbite many died of exposure and none of these troops were prepared for fighting any kinds of conditions\nYou given incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of his sleeping bag and only realizes after fighting for hours that he had never managed to put his boots on you\nKnow this is Hector calf or add up to receive the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night he may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position\nThe Marines in parts of the battle were outnumbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never killed a man before he'd never been in combat and suddenly her he was surrounded\nTwenty thousand factories are chosen reservoir slog than fought their way sixty bitter miles to the evacuation important to them\nSnow mountain I feed prices they held off two hundred thousand [noise]\nThe first Marine Division escaped but Chinese troops retook North Korea and the country's remain divided today the dividing line only slightly changed but the Korean people those who survived changed a lot they had a different perspective on this story we just heard\nYou focus on one particular Korea and leave by smoke who wasn't\nWell Dr Lee as he is now known he was a North Korean kid and um escaped to the south moved to soul as a uh\nWell Dr Lee as he is now known he was a North Korean kid and a escape to the south moved to soul as a a teenager\nOnly to have the war reach soul in Nineteen fifty when North Korean forces invaded\nHis uncle and his aunt were both murdered many of his friends were murdered you had to hide out in a house in Seoul\nHe hid until American forces entered the city blasting to ruin says they took it back\nThought the capital city of Seoul [noise]\nMedia we volunteered with the Marines and they gave him an assignment which was to go be an interpreter and a guard in the very city that he had grown up in in North Korea ham on my\n... experiences as an American interpreter in the north\nHe was assigned to guard a bridge in his hometown a bridge they called the bridge of long life\nAnd he was there to prevent refugees from crossing it he hated this assignment but then he found out that his sister was on the other side of the bridge of long life\nAnd that she was not allowed to cross and that his whole family was about to board one of these ships for this great evacuation to the south and that they're going to have to leave his sister there forever\nAnd so he prevail do over the American guards they got into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city and they found her and she rejoined her family and and made it to the south\nLead by suck survived the war and emigrated to the United states he is now Dr Levi suck of Cincinnati, Ohio and American citizen and Hampton Sides was able to interview him for this book because this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime law\nWhat is it been like to be working on this book about Korea through a period where North Korea has been exploding\nNuclear weapons and launching missiles and then sending their leader to meet with President Trump and everything else\nIt's been very strange and you know I'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand and Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a war could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting because there's such a profound desire both in the north and the south for some kind of a improvement in the relationship\nHampton Sides is the author of on desperate ground the Marines at the reservoir\nAnd the Korean War as great as battle

Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV is turn this on so any potential witness for victim is um let's say ten and\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State to help to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing and saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in that case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone was lying or compromise or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do it\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom Trump blade says you could do an actual criminal investigation into case such as Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed recording but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\n... is the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try looking at\nThe circumstances scaring from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this ...\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI Martin Kaste NPR News [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nThanks for joining me for NPR's MORNING EDITION right here on member supported high plains public radio the current time is Eighteen minutes ahead of seven AM central coming up and less than a minute we've got a regional news report for you so stay tuned\nHi this is Jenny ends hello music director at high plains public radio thanks to you our member listeners shouldn't rocks and rolls and swings and it's kind of you keep the music going get now at H.

perhaps a graphic memoir\nRegardless it's an important book in fact the national book foundation deemed that important enough to short listed for a National Book award and twenty fourteen\nAnd can we talk about something more pleasant chest brings her famous blend of course you know some rye humor mixed with her scribbling drawings to the weighty subject of the loss of her own parents\nAt first blush approaching the subject of death and what is essentially a very long comic strip may seem a bit strange but in fact I found the opposite to be true chess cartoons make the subject more familiar more comfortable and certainly easier to digest\nJust as a truly funny woman but not in a try hard way the book comes off as a compassionate and Ernest look at a hard period and the author's life and the humor that bubbled up through these pages is effortless and organic\nWhat makes the book truly memorable above all is chess honesty like most of us chest was not raised in an ideal environment\nHer parents Elizabeth and George chest\nWe're neurotic corners in Brooklyn New York in their love for their only daughter was of the distant and intermittent variety her mother Elizabeth refused to be wrong about anything and George was a wilting flour I was most struck when chest admitted that she always had the sense that her parents\nWere just waiting for their daughter to grow up

toll of trying to house to elderly people\nIn a facility that provides twenty four hour care or offering up the bleak particulars of what happened to her parents bodies and their final days but the journey while sobering ultimately proves and lightning and even meditative\nWith its irrepressible humor chess spoke as much needed guide to the process many of us will likely face sooner or later of shepherding our own parents into the next world but it's the specificity of the details ironically that make chests story feel universal\nIn their ... their quirks their oddities an eccentricity is
