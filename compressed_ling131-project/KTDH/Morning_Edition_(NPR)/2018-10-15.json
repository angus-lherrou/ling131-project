EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey at the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's resources of the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon Kentucky system lump sum show\nThough I'm Michelle filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon about hundred twenty two countries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export markets a nice little extra\nOr it it has a point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past few years you're probably are global sales have been out facing your domestic sales while\nAnd just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\nThat sorted appeal or but yet they I I Would say they're international sales or\nThan it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon is about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it has a point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're you probably are global sales have been out\nPacing your domestic sales while and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ... from the\nDoor to the dealer but yes they I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a NAFTA and the EU agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if it starts at slate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nAh we don't like any options on the table miss the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people that have converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back\nOr which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious as a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot to ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings [noise]\nAh [noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for the issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh come up as an issue yet you made an issue like an election\nYeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months the\nTip of meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how did the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows will probably means you can decade or he will not for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes ah in in he told us he understood exactly that did it with the sushi could mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called Burman thinks that that's a federal law writers they federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced they can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here in American if he wants to sell it you better make in Kentucky\nBeginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears\nIs that all these gods drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and and from my standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before\nYou know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose the for generations ferret\nGregory of the Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage damage from hurricane might talk which hit Florida Panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable rather than non functional phones and made life difficult for residents and rescue team and for insurance\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose the bar industry and if we lose them now than we might lose it for a generation ferret\nGregory of Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total damage damage from hurricane Michael which hit Florida Panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable road than non functional phones made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster is\nJust a ... mile cross\n... works in the fried division of tower hill a Florida homeowner's insurance company over the weekend he caught a cell phone signal near Panama City there were still places it wasn't safe for his team to travel\nFor the situation like that and that aside at it\nAnd it wasn't just buildings that were devastated by the storm\nA lot of areas of lost a generation of timber poultry farms are hit pretty hard and caught industry is just devastated\nChris Chandler than adjuster with alpha insurance and Alabama he's been working in Houston county\nCaught was ready to beat it last week and a sixty Seventy a hundred miles per hour winds just\nIt away last April source of income us or livelihood\nEarly estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says the insurance companies will have substantial cost but Fitch also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so it's good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now the communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler in Alabama says the damage it upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your fingers and like everything ... obviously that's not going to happen or you don't want your your talk of the people that house was destroyed\nAll their belongings showed her pictures no amount of money is going to get an image back of your of your parents that are passed away so your child first birthday\nIf Republicans hang onto their majorities in the house and Senate their approach to governing will be validated they can continue to confirm judges take another whack at Obamacare help President Trump shutdown them other investigation on the other hand says former Republican majority leader Eric Cantor\nIf the Republicans are unable to maintain their majority in the house democratic rule no matter who the speaker is will be very much in opposition to a Trump White house\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be a perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a\nSimple majority gives you almost absolute power to her again sets the agenda and get bills across for that will greatly affect the willingness for some who had been at it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not\nCancer things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to president\nAgenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be a perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a\nSimple majority gives you almost absolute power to again sets the agenda and get bills across for that will greatly affect the willingness for some who had been at it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not\nCancer things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be older because what if the Democrats take by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts at opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere will be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goal I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump being base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty eight or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning at the election as we are dedicated to luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding dull\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that looted them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News thanks\nFor joining me for NPR's MORNING EDITION right here on member supported high plains public radio the current time is Eighteen minutes ahead of six am central coming up and less than a minute we've got a regional news report for you so stay tuned\nH.

kind of wrong\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with his nurse practitioner making Salinger\nAnd I kind of fish or having grown up and running out and now what\nAm I still have a call but by and large sums of the group's founder was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in he

Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause organs to fail\nCharlie was put in to medically induced coma for over a week his father and brother flew in from out of town and we were told they may need to say goodbye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscled said atrophied the doctors who are worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat\nI basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to share all this\nFrom the flu it's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard his doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people to complications from the flu a lack of immunity but Charlie was young and healthy\nIt can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy you're going in\nAnd that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody it doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but all the family members that came to visit got a two for you know I got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days before his thirty ninth birthday he got out of the nursing home and went to his home for

bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey at the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and the homeless Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's great sources at the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lumps don't show that comes to shove filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnd oh it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the pet seniors you're probably your global sales have been out\nFacing your domestic sales while and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the soldiers are still are but yet the I Would say they're international sales are starting to outpaced their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements with well a ... agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem ah but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that looked like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nAh we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks is no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer and hopefully you know have people you've converted from God's do remain bourbon drinkers um or you take your profit back\nA which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so the lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious as the state that voted for president Janette has voted for Republicans a lot to ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings [noise]\nAh I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much uh uh come up with\nWhile you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh come up as an issue\nDo you mean an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean Congress and bar has been very helpful to us in the past few months he\nSaid the meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows who Burmese Kentucky or he will note for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes a ... he he told us he understood exactly that this would this mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks very intensive federal law writers they federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which now so you could move some production overseas we can do that with barb you've got to make it here in American if he wants to sell you better make the\nBeginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if it hasn't been a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers there'd be invited over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and I stand point if\nThe bourbon is hiring fried maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking\nBefore you know we might lose for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations ferret\nGregory of the Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total damage from hurricane Michael which hit Florida Panhandle last week

outskirts of ... miles across\n... works in the fried division of power hill a Florida homeowner's insurance company over the weekend he caught and cell phones and on the air Panama city there were

estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says that insurance companies will have substantial costs but it's also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so with good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long

should retire or not\nCantor things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be voting because look if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be if divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere will be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we're dedicated luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang onto power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding them all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrower majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News\nAnd you're listening to NPR News on your high plains public radio station I'm Bob Davis joining me in the studios Dale both in ... and are are coming out of a story on politics and that is a wonderful segue to make a couple of announcements for programming and for other parts\nOf uh what we're covering on Thursday October the twenty fifth there will be a debate in Garden City Kansas among the candidates for governor of Kansas and high plains public radio will be there to broadcast the debate live\nOr to start at six thirty is estimated to last about Ninety minutes and uh\n[noise] uh I went other announcement is coming up on our news and information all news and information channel H.

nine year old St Louis Mandel is almost one of them\nNow he's encouraging everyone to do something he had never done before Bram Sable Smith reports\nCharlie hinder lighter wasn't opposed to the flu

he's director of government affairs at the St Louis realtors association\nIn like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out I was wrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week and a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of wrong\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with his nurse practitioner making Salinger\nAnd I send a message to the other day you are having some cash and right now and now what\nI still have a call but by and large sums of improved Jones who was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in here do you knew he had the flu actually his wife had to ... was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause organs to fail\nCharlie was put into medically induced coma for over a week\nHis father and brother flew in from out of town and we were told they may need to say good bye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors who are worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat I basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair all of this from the flu\nIt's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard\nHis doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people the complications from the flu a lack of immunity but Charlie was young and healthy it can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in and that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody it doesn't offer complete\nTo anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in\nAnd that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody it doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but all the family members that came to visit got a two for you know I got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days before

time\nWe're talking about your membership in public radio a lot right now and I I don't know if I can make the analogy that yours a pledge of support is like a flu shot for public radio I don't know I it's in there somewhere but I'll leave that let alone the important thing is that your pledge of support for public radio is what makes MORNING EDITION happen\nWhen you call eight hundred six seven eight seven four four four and get counted as a member of public radio\nThose dollars every penny of those dollars goes to bringing you programs like MORNING EDITION you make it possible with your
