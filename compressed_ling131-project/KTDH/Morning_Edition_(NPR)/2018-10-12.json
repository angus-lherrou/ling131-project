News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm now well king good morning a court in Turkey has released a pastor from North Carolina who'd been held under house arrest the case of pastor Andrew Brunson has been a priority of the Trump Administration and the subject of repeated talks\nAnd attempted high level deals between the U.S and turkey\nBrunson have lived in Turkey for two decades and in two thousand and sixteen he was arrested along with tens of thousands of other people after a coup attempt he spent most of that time in jail before being allowed house arrest in July\nNPR's Peter Kenyon is in Istanbul Peter I know I told my case that's one what do we know about pastor Brunson and the charges against him well\nHe's lived for a long time and his mirror in western Turkey's about fifty years old he ran a small evangelical church there are but then as you noted in September twenty sixteen he was arrested charged with aiding terrorist groups are both Kurdish militants and this cleric that turkey blames for the twenty sixteen failed to\nWas arrested charged with aiding terrorist groups are both Kurdish militants end this cleric that turkey blames for that twenty sixteen failed coup attempt\nUm there's some been arguing that Brunson was basically caught up in this massive purge\nOf air to once suspected enemies president ... to one of turkey and in fact he was held at first in jail and then in this year he was transferred to house arrest in late July he's always denied the charges a there's been speculation that turkey was hoping to trade Brunson for some Turks being held in us jails a\nWashington's been pushing for his release a basically ever since he was detained\nWhat the court say about why he was being released today\nWell the court actually issued a conviction or with a sentence of just over three years of the prosecutor desperate ten\nBut at the same time the judge has ruled that Brunson shouldn't serve anymore prison time than he already has a in part taking his health into consideration\nOf the court also lifted judicial controls on Brunson that means restrictions on his movement to have been lifted and he is now free to leave the country are you know there were thoughts this might have happened earlier this year the White House thought they had a deal\nAfter President Trump spoke with the Turkey's president\nBut at that point he was only move from prison to house arrest and that upset the White House pressure's been ratcheting up ever since uh there's been sanctions back and forth and there's no doubt that with the shaky economy here turkey really wanted to put this dispute behind them\nI mean the interesting thing here is how involved President Trump and vice president Pence and secretary of state Mike Pompeo have all been in this case why one such a big priority for them\nWell or the administration's well known for a close ties to the evangelical Christian community in the U.S those certainly a vice president Pence ... state Mike Pompeo a well known devout Christians\nUh this is sure to pleased that part of Trump's constituency are also on the plus side for the U.S they're not actually trading anyone for brunch and it was a matter of putting on sanctions and they'll lifting them\nUh but I have to say this decision is also a big relief for turkey and president ... uh he's struggling to hold the economy together the currency is way down the inflation is soaring uh these sanctions from America on aluminum and steel and on cabinet ministers\nHave added to the economic pain [noise] um and now turkey has every expectation that those punitive measures will now be eased er lifted once pastor Brunson is back on us soil so\nAre there going to be quite happy with that aspect of it\nNPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul
