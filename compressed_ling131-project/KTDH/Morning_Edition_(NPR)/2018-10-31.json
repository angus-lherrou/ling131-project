happen in this country we often don't understand the motive that is not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assessment that argument\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are most liberal it out to control the world Jeffrey her for historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of arguments a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to first and only go so I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nA rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean the President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion\nMatters related to Israel but Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another doesn't bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory\nThe Jews run the world has written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest people [noise] you know what are they talking about they talk about the leaves do you ever see the elite\nWhen people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in law are Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that is in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they can find other people that share their views and urge them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of an anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or

customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stores may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect the model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercials faces CEO Mohammed oh wash says everyone's using pop ups from small Internet retailers to

says record labels have even set up pop up centered around a specific artist awash says as recently as five years ago many landlords would rather sit on a vacant property for a year then entertain a

every day or every week\nHe says in some cases the pop of rent or turns into a permanent tenant\nThere is a solution and build up right now the short term is than your doctor\nWhen it comes to pop ups

I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I\nThere was just not quite enough evidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't\nKnow [noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of bullying and and I guess some people would just\nAnd in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of bullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and said that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angers [noise] I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nCorrect and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a a Republican and that's coming election [noise]\nHave you talk to your family about your about your evolution\nI have [laughter] than a void they get\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio

country we often don't ever understand them out if\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say hit the bits of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten has document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey Herve historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful an enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a person holding us I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... use that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another doesn't bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nHas written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element who says his deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as they did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest me [noise] you know what are they talking about they talk about the the leaf you ever see the elite\nWhen people are encouraged to resent the elite\nJews get nervous that danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and ... is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred and if in order to win he needs to end the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox\nBe at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy
