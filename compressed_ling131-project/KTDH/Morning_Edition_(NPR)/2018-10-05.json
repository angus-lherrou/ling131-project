Romero of cake you weedy begins this report with a sign of just how troubling the conditions were\nThere have been at least seven suicide attempts and less than a year at the privately run either lentil immigrant processing facility and death uh thirty two year old man killed himself by hanging in twenty Seventeen and three detain people died in part because of medical neglect since twenty Fifteen\nThat's all according to the inspectors report\nDuring an unannounced bet that inspectors found health and safety violations including a disabled man who was confined to his wheelchair for nine days and nights\nNews says made out of bed sheets and detainees cells that could aid suicide and people waiting weeks or months to see a doctor\nThe medical attention has very low standard\n... thirty one he spent six months that ... and was just released this summer we're not using his last name because he fears it could hurt because asylum case\nThat just came to the point where we just were not even putting in medical requests because we said what for\nA spokesperson for the California attorney general says they'll ... cetera the federal inspectors findings as they pursue their own first ever investigation of immigration facilities California gained authority to inspect federal detention centers and the state holding nearly five thousand detainees\nFrom uh twenty Seventeen law authored by state senator Ricardo Lara\nThe federal government owned report is valid dating are concerned\nThat ... have sued to overturned that law and court but Laura says the new report gives legal ammunition to California\nMakes it much more important for California for how ... bigger role and investigating what is really happening in the front and center\nBut the California attorney general's review as not expected until march of next year\n... with the inland coalition for immigrant justice\nIs concerned about ... another lentil now but ... all these people are pretty much the risk ... help detainees filed grievances with immigration and Customs Enforcement that ... has pretty much ... that's what a report from homeland security itself found earlier this year\nI does not adequately follow up on problems or whole facility\nInvestigating what is really happening in the center\nBut the California attorney general's review is not expected until march of next year\nAt least sided with the inland coalition for immigrant jet that\nIt's concerned about detainees in Atlanta now the lives of these people are pretty much a risk so that it helps detainees filed grievances with immigration and Customs Enforcement the grievances pretty much gone over that's what a report from homeland security itself found earlier that year\nIce does not adequately follow up on problems or whole facility accountable some deficiencies remain quote on addressed for years\nImmigrant rights groups and former detainees fake conditions are poor at many other detention center throughout the country\nAnd actually it's a little bit I mean I think what the ... men says health actually terrible at that time mess that detention facility in California where she spent eight months locked up as she sought asylum in the U.S claim was rejected and she was deployed\nAnd met her in the climate Mexico Memphis man enough what he'll do either it took days you could see a doctor or a severe ear infection she sat in response\nTo the violation said Atlanta both ice and the GEO Group the private company that operates the facility say they take the federal inspectors findings seriously and they're working to correct them find the our News I'm funny that that by that our meadow in San Francisco [noise]\nWe expect that people will start filtering in and giving speeches and I will also see many speeches that are part of the debate that comes after the cloture vote this ... necessary procedurals out because some senators are saying that they are going to wait until after this procedural vote to tell us how they're going to vote on the final\nConference okay this is important let's underline this this is a vote to end debate\nYou can conceivably say yes I'm ready to end debate but I'm Still not going to vote for the nominee a vote today on the side of Kavanaugh's does not guarantee that you would vote for Kavanaugh in the final votes which I guess might be tomorrow is that what you're telling me\nYeah that that is typically a once this hurdle they felt that we're going to see in less than an hour now wondered hurdle is cleared usually that means that the final vote is it done and but it isn't written in stone\nSo there is a possibility that people could change their minds down the line and I will say that that like I said is quite rare and we are expecting some people including on you know we're still waiting to hear from Senator Susan Collins\nAnd we may hear from her at that time so we did it one of those things where we're going to have to lock this throughout the day to know exactly what will happen on that final vote which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedural do today\nAnd David Greene is co hosting our coverage this morning\nThey kill the I don't I Wonder if you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and\nAnd what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then he senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and an all this context feel different\nOh absolutely that's been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up which is not normal um that there are barricades set up and they're\nAnd what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then these senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and an all this context feel different\nOh absolutely that's been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are a barricade set up which is ... not knowing that there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I have seen president on from just about any voted any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about in American politics for the past year or so\nIt seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills they pass an essay that they'll they they are doing those basic pieces of governance\nBut as soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how lie all the other side as well still getting to the basics of government on pushing it if they can continue to do that or if these fights towers them for more negotiations down the road\nWe'll turn to to uh or other colleague Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's been in studios in Washington Scott ... so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of the food we have Grassley I think a Dianne Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nYeah and we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't call it there's not a hard time living on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more\nA before then we're going to hear from Fort key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford\nFor many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring up right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have to go and I know you've been covering the politics around all of this has had this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this midterm election terms of momentum on on on both sides and both\nParties we think it has and the question is will outlast the remaining month a month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years for example somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago\nSo I remember I remember that I had a very ugly remember something in the past about that yeah\nBut you know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of attention within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race from mid summer until now and a lot of people see the cabin off fight as a key reason a lot of Republicans\nFeeling feeling or under siege and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in ... Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as as cabinet under sees a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard\nLet's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to ...\nBetween Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race for mid summer until now and a lot of people see the cabin off fight as a key reason a lot of Republican\nFeeling feeling a ... and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in ... Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting that's as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard\nLet's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of a\nSexual assault even under the laws standard of proof she concluded quote a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this cases even weaker than that Dr Ford identify other witnesses to the event so knows witnesses either refuted or allegations or fail to reach\nCorroborate them for the reasons discuss all I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor could bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy\nTheir preponderance of evidence standard end quote\nWe have thoroughly investigated judge Kavanaugh's background\nIn addition to the prior six FBI fall feel feel background investigations were the interviews of nearly a hundred and fifty people who have known judge Kavanaugh his entire life\nThe committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegation that were received are more than twenty committee staff members have work night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leads and at the request of undecided members\nThe FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nThe FBI interviewed ten more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations and the FBI confirms what we've Senate investigators already concluded that is is there's nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already know\nThese on corroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by\nA judge Kavanaugh and these are the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations there also is no contemporary contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hand of misconduct and the same is true of six prior FBI investigations are conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service\nNothing and investigator including career FBI special agents does ever\nBe good enough\nTo satisfy Democrat leaderships in Washington who staked out opposition\nTo judge Kavanaugh before he was even nominate there is simply no reason then to the high judge Kavanaugh a seat on the Supreme Court on the basis of the evidence presented to us the Democratic strategy used against judge Kavanaugh\nHas made one thing clear they will never be satisfied no matter how fair and ... the process is\nThirty one years ago the Senate Democrats treatment as Robert Bork their playbook remains the same for the left wing advice and consent has become\nOf listening to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this is special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some voices\nThe Democratic strategy used against a Kevin all\nHas made one thing clear they will never be satisfied no matter how fair and through the process is\nThirty one years ago the Senate Democrats treatment as Robert Bork or playbook remains the same for the left wing advice and consent has become sort\nOf listening to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this is special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some voices from the United States Senate as they prepare to vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court to vote again today is to end debate the formal vote to actually confirm or not\nWould probably be sometime tomorrow we just heard a reference there to Robert Bork a man who was a nominated to the Supreme Court by president Ronald Reagan in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd ultimately rejected after a campaign by Democrats who said that his views were extreme Charles Grassley argues that essentially the same thing is happening now that Brett Kavanaugh's being ... which is the way the conservatives refer to this new Totenberg is that a fair comparison\nI actually don't think it's a fair comparison I'm Robert ... nomination has been a sore point for Republicans now ever since it happened ever since he was defeated\nAnd there's been a lot of academic studies now of the confirmation process and how book fairs and the fact is that Bork went into his confirmation hearings with the votes to easily be confirmed\nA liberal entrance did have some ads against him and they were chump change compared to what the money that spent today I mean I think they mainly aired in Washington DC so that they would get written about by the likes to be in me um but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "05"}
