Kavanaugh instinct was fury on his own half the stuff I Want him to live\nHis instinct was very public fury on his\nOwn behalf of his number one in the clouds are going on no no no no going after so I'm going to borrow more I don't know I mean I'm sure I'm going to talk about my ... year mocked me\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible\nHe had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people [noise] I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her\nTreats or has been exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women thing or\nThe moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning on women's march it was also anger\nAt some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history and it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the put the hat you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after\nThe women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but this week and of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then\nMeet you [noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example\nWhat historically was so threatening about women think well in part that anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation\nAnd who were angry and protested in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women [noise] you referenced\nThe racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so do you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment\nI think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and so marginalized for so long when in fact it's women of color who have been the ...\nLoudly enough because they have been so unheard and so marginalized for so long when in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading thinkers have so many of our social movements in ways that have remain invisible to us so when we think about meat you one of the things that gets lost\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience or the reality\nOf the harm they sustained but in fact all of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years although\nWe have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so as women think are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time and that kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh\nIs going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future Rebecca Traister is the author of the book good and bad the revolutionary power of women to anger is out today [noise]\n\n\n\n\nThis is NPR

weapons or whether the person accused as a prior history or under this law\nProsecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level

new Dell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting an arrest and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of near of objective science attorney ... says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIt's a pretty well documented fact the police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy\nIn fact the police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people\nAnd that the courts treat people of color and treat poor people worse or there's various factors that they use risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd

morning as mark how are you\nI'm doing welfare so the president um haven't been able to check this box and he talked about that for many many years how he believes that NAFTA was not a good deal for American workers he didn't exactly ripped up the NAFTA deal um a lot of the foundation still there but what do you believe are the most substantive changes\nBut it it can just check a box you check the Walmart big box of all boxers I mean this is a major achievement going back in Nineteen Ninety four this is a twenty four year old agreement\nUh there's two things that are different now want it to modernize is the agreement back in the day we didn't have things like digital trade we didn't have things like biologics er which are complex of pharmaceuticals or we have a strong a new disciplines and protections for that so that that's a really good thing\nUh but the big thing really is is what the trade represented likes to call restructuring the old NAFTA basically ah the

Martin the FBI is broadening its investigation into Brett Kavanaugh this week and with the Supreme Court nominees still in the news it's hard for a lot of us to get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how different the tone was of the two witnesses\nDr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact that it had on my life and I my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own\nBehalf um number one in the class I thought oh no no no no no no not this I'm going to I'm going to borrow more I don't know I mean I'm sure I'm going to talk about my high school record our city you're mocked me was\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible\nHe had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people [noise] I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that seemed tool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her\nTrace or has been exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women think are\nThat it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger\nAnd it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the intra ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really just mentioned a lot of quarters is being\nObviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really just missing a lot of quarters as being about the pain cats the put the hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but this week\nAnd of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then meet you\n[noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger being laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically what so threatening about women banker\nWell impart that anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protest it in ways that we understand correctly to this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government\nSo they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment\nI think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and so marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who have been\nThe leaders and the leading fingers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remain invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases have been brutally sexually harassed and their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill whose testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq's\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience of the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of a raised\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past two years\nWe have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this is a character assassination by the left so as women's anger only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive part and I tend to not at all\nThat is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nTo a progressive part and I tend to not at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time\nAnd that kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh is going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future Rebecca Traister is the author of the both good and mad the revolutionary power of women to anger is out today [noise]\n\n\n\n\nThis is NPR News\nWith H.
