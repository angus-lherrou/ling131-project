eager to use Interpol to locate an extra day Chinese officials that it deemed corrupt would a scape China\nBut as it turns out among himself is now under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\n[noise] will China's government has been released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how is the tension unfolded has come from his wife greats among on September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mode even nice to just being that she was in danger\nA week later she reported him missing the French police on Sunday she spoke to

mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with

when you're in the same room at the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them\nYes or no or you know you couldn't say anything\nDavidson says when you're in the same room as the judge it's

shake\nOut trying to explain to the judge what happened and they told me to record\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison [noise]\nLawyer Rosalie joy says she hear stories like David sent all the time she's with the national legal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court has some defense attorneys concerned that alienates the acute from those deciding their fate\nEven before the proceeding began you already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process\nYou are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as\nEffective in the courtroom for my client unless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase bail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the accused say it's a

been called by the vision team appointees of then governor Sam Brownback who had taken a noteworthy interest in conserving the Ogallala Aquifer\nWe hundred or more attendees were divided into groups of around eight each and asked to address a series of questions for instance what role might technology play in conserving the aquifer and how could education about the aquifer be improved\nBut the question that stands out in my memory asked simply how long should the water last\nI was struck by the earnest and heartfelt response as of the farmers at my table\nThe water should last for generations one man said forever set another these wishful aspirations were met with foreign ... nods no one said as many farmers had in news stories I'd read over the years\nThat the water was there to use as they pleased and leaving it in the ground when do anyone any good\nI guess that enough water had passed under the bridge or through irrigation pipes for them to realize that a crisis was truly up on them several worried that unless they took serious measures now the water would soon be gone and their children and grandchildren wouldn't be able to profit from the land and they had\nAll their new seed varieties and technologies did make it possible to use less water the farmers readily admitted that these with all my slow the aquifers decline\nI kept waiting for someone to mention the elephant in the room but since no one did I guess it was up to me\nHeart Tom Payne I said that the federal government was driving the aquifers depletion with the ethanol mandate\nAnd by subsidizing crop insurance for corn the crop grown most widely on irrigated acres don't you think that the mandate should be ended I asked and the government should pay you instead to retire your water rides or at the very least grow more drought tolerant crops\nCorn is very water efficient one farmer proclaimed the nods around the table this time were insistent and affirming but I had filed my father's irrigation reports with the Kansas water office for over Twenty years and I had done the math\nWe had used on average Nineteen hundred gallons of water per bushel of corn which amounted to more than twice the water that fell from the sky\nUsed on average Nineteen hundred gallons of water per bushel of corn which amounted to more than twice the water that fell from this guy in a normal growing season in down markets government subsidies had been the only reason we had made money on that crap\nBut not one farmer at that table was willing to entertain changes in government corn policy each of them did want the water to last forever they really did but they didn't want to give up their most profitable crop even if that was the only way to save it\nWho can blame them what else can be

of those companies plus super micro the electronics maker that was allegedly infiltrated\nAnd the Chinese government have all categorically denied the report but this story lingers in part because it brings up a very scary reality that cybersecurity experts keep talking about Bruce Schneier is one of those experts he says in our global economy the most dangerous Lincoln the chain is the manufacturing floor\nThat is the problem that these things could happen and we have no assurance that they do or even know what to do if they did\nRight and you've written about how you know true or
