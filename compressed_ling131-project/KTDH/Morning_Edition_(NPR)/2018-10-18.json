Sally and Democrat ... cinema [noise]\nTravel it's super politically active\nHe's a regional director for the Arizona federation of Republican win in the end of member of the Pima County Republican win\nBut today she's at a pizza restaurant in ...

firmly on the mic Sally [noise] and she thinks the foreign Kavanaugh hearings have amped up enthusiasm in her party\nI think it helped escalate that I think it said on both sides [noise]\nI'm not

going to vote what else do I do\nRepublicans may be getting more fired\nUp now but there was already plenty of democratic fury almost two years worth of it and democratic strategist Andy Barr things

over the cabin are controversy send them on the Democratic candidate doesn't sound outraged cinema has focused a lot of her rhetoric around process like the FBI investigation affords claims\nWhen I learned that we were not going to get access to the report I was very disappointed but I think many Americans were\nSo I was forced to make a decision without being able to see that report\nForced to make a decision that's a far cry from other Democrats who have emphasized that they believe Kavanaugh had assaulted forward right now the races in a dead heat polling shows that send them a slight lead on mic Sally has narrowed in the last couple of weeks Republican strategist John Seton things cabin all played a part in that trend really what\nI think it did do is somewhat anyway galvanize go center right and Republican voters to come all the fuel and make sure that the male their ballots vote for the Republican ticket\nBut especially with the candidates and their allies sticking to other areas like immigration and health care as well as personal attacks democratic strategist bars says it's hard to say that the confirmation hearings are what narrow that gap\nThe undecided grew more than they always start to come home or at around you know we are to balance\nIn a debate this week both candidates chose not to weaponize the Kavanaugh fight too much while the president has gone so far as to call for decades Haitians a hoax mix Sally focused her criticism on Democrats an active is not Ford herself\nWe're seeing the mob rule in Washington DC and and the and Arizona's wanted a yes

towers near Panama City Florida we're functioning there is no doubt run a more positive track\nMatthew Berry is chief of staff at the Federal Communications commission the agency criticized the slow pace of progress earlier this week\nBut we need to keep the attention on this problem and keep the pressure on because they're still a ways to go when we can't have any backsliding in the next few days\nRestoring cell service is always a problem after a big storm the absence of a signal means people outside the storm's path I left worrying about loved ones they can't reach long residents have trouble contacting local authorities and their insurance companies\nThe FCC says it usually takes a few days to approach full coverage after Hurricane Sandy it took about a week after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico it took six months an extreme situation\nThe problem with hurricane Michael is that several days after the storm the FCC was noticing only marginal progress and the most devastated areas\nWe don't agree that this is an unacceptable situation\nKrista born is rising market president for wireless in the south she says for rising slow recovery from this storm was uncharacteristic

mean he isn't on voters' minds Alan Abramowitz is a professor of political science at Emory University he studied midterm elections and said there is a very strong correlation between presidential approval and the results for his party\nNot only is it always about the president to some degree but there's a lot a lot of reasons to believe that now this year it'll be even more about the president\nAnd why is that well first of all because Trump has has tried to make it about him\nFor Marcia is really a vote for me and everything we stand for\nMe I don't vote for him to use your vote for me I don't receive is a vote for me remember\nThe man or a job to\nGreat again\nIn the a P interview Trump explained that he was making this explicit appeal because of the people at his rallies are there for him and some have even told him they don't plan to vote in the midterms in twenty fourteen President Obama made a similar appeal\nOn the on the ballot this fall\nShort for every mother [noise]\nBut make no mistake these policies are on the ballot every single one\nAt the time it was seen as a gaffe many Democrats were trying to distance themselves from Obama whose approval rating at the time within the low forties Trump's approval is in a similar spot now again Abramowitz\nYour most probably gonna incumbents who are at risk of losing their seats were probably rather localized\nProve all isn't it similar spot now again Abramowitz\nYou're both public and incumbents who are at risk of losing their seats were probably rather localized election Trump back more about local issues about things they've done for their state or district and not about the president\nBut regardless of what candidates want this is a nationalized election sixty percent of voters according

programs that you hear on the high plains public radio it's the second to pause and to reflect and to cut through a lot of uh\nA lot of things that seem to be going by it a hundred miles an hour past us because we're onto the next story in the next story\nOf members tell us they a\nValue a program like MORNING EDITION because it slows down that page just a little bit let's let's the listener pause and reflect and what did we learn where are we now and and nothing could be more important in the time where we're leading up to an election where information is at a premium but\nWhere are we now and nothing could be more important in the time where we're leading up to an election where information is at a premium but unfortunately the rancor and partisanship and misinformation is also clouding the era let\nHigh plains public radio and MORNING EDITION help you clear way that fog to make an informed decision\nAnd today's modern world one of the greatest things that you can arm yourself with information and that is certainly one MORNING EDITION strive to provide to deliver it to you on a daily basis and then that information is only available in our region because listeners want to see a continuation listeners just like you\nI'm ... and how is important well it's important to remember that if the Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts the Saudi Arabia I'm frankly at this point more than that hurts the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on Saudi oil than we were in the past um\nAnd and I would also argue that we need to look at the broader scope of of the trend line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia um we're selling Saudi Arabia um it's a much more arms today than we were ten years ago or ... and so what I'm suggesting is that we just return to a level of\nArms sales to a military relationship that looks much more like it did a a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting scaling up\nA a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting scaling back to where it used to be\nSenator Chris Murphy Democrat of Connecticut and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee senator Mm\nThe Associated Press asked President Trump this week if he would bear some responsibility if Republicans lose the house in November the president replied no but as NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump may not want the blame is a GOP takes a hit but he still thinks the election is about him\nPresident Trump isn't on the ballot in November but that doesn't mean he isn't on voters' minds Alan Abramowitz is a professor of political science at Emory University he studied midterm elections and says there is a very strong correlation between presidential approval and the results for his party\nNot only is it always about the president to some degree but there's a lot a lot of reasons to believe that now this year it'll be even more about the president\nAnd why is that well first of all because Trump has has tried to make it about him\nAnd horror Marcia is really a vote for me and everything we stand for\nMe to vote for or vote for me to\nReceive is a vote for me\nRemember [noise] it's hard for me and our agenda to\nAgain in the a P interview Trump explained that he was making that's explicit appeal because the people at his rallies are there for him and some have even told them they don't plan to vote in the midterms in twenty fourteen President Obama made a similar appeal\nI'm not on the ballot this fall\n... [noise]\nBut make no mistake these policies are on the ballot every single one of them\nAt the time it was seen as a gaffe many Democrats were trying to distance themselves from Obama approval rating at the time within the low forties Trump's approval is in a similar spot now again Abramowitz\nMost probably the incumbents who are at risk of losing their seats would probably rather localized election Trump ... more of a local issues about things they've done for their state or district and not about the president\nBut regardless of what candidates want this is a nationalized election sixty percent of voters according to a recent Pew Research center poll say Trump will be a factor in their congressional vote with a greater share saying they will be voting against the president than for him camera Keith NPR News [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News\n[noise] MORNING EDITION and supported in part by west Texas a and M. university creating connection with our community by remembering the past and looking for and looking toward the future more information at W.
