protect Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe had thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my other\nGirl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on the streets selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its ... had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present a story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking it smells that are making a difference\nSo who is ... why did she start that's organization\n... a woman from New Jersey\nHe'll who is Katie my other why did she start that's organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of yeah of community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and kitty ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped start this organization on the ground in Liberia are demanding Macintosh Johnson Catholics about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante group which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the area of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way to keep it to be using these girls\nJumps in was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ...\nAnd he was using that power according to the girl told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power according to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask ... and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my I had an intimate relationship with him but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho said that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation different that she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that the he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh John ... was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who have contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were to be tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says you know\nDo you outlined in the ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly fields that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the city that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had from the chapters leadership so there was a sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allowed the organization to operate schools there\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community at the sense of\nA lot of people that are feeling that something had gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the food fight so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a full investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we how what's our process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether they Chevy aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat we Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin story was published Katie my lawyer has temporarily stepped down as CEO of more than me this is NPR News\n[noise]\nLooking back on October Seventeen and the state in Nineteen sixty five some little Arkansas peace treaty was signed representatives from the highway\nSince the CDC began tracking the disease four years ago a total of three hundred and eighty six cases have been confirmed\nOne case with a seven year old boy and his mother Susan Klein says her son came down with an ear infection this was back in the fall of two thousand fourteen\nSo I took him to the pediatrician and she put them on a antibiotic\nBut within a few days Evan complained of severe pain in his back and legs he became extremely lethargic and went downhill quickly\nHe lost total Michael control and both his arms and legs you know one minute you have a healthy head and the next minute your kid is totally paralyzed it it it was beyond a\nHorrifying to us it's not clear what caused Evan sickness and the CDC is Nancy ... says unfortunately the cause of the condition is still unknown\nI'm frustrated that despite all of our effort we haven't been able to identify the cause of this mystery illness we don't know who may be at higher risk for developing them or the reasons why they may be at higher risk\nNothing ... says given the rise in cases the CDC is escalating its response and consulting with a variety of experts to solve the mystery they do know that some kids who get it have also had viruses such as entering virus another possible risk factor is West Nile virus\nWhich so far there's no common pathogen that links all the cases\nDespite extensive laboratory testing we have not determined what packaging or immune response or the arm or leg weakness and paralysis and most of these patients\nGiven that the symptoms are similar to polio a disease that have been almost completely eradicate it mentioned ... pointed out that this is not polio\nRight now we know that polio virus is not the cause of these a at them cases CDC has tested every little specimen from math and patients none of the fitness have tested positive for polio virus\nThe CDC says despite the increase in cases asked him is a very rare condition affecting fewer than one and a million children but she says it's good to be aware of the signs and symptoms the Ninety percent of those affected our children there are some cases and adults\nWe recommend seeking medical care right away if you or your child develops sudden weakness of the arms her legs\nAnd do the CDC can't give any specific information about what's causing a FM ... says it's good to take general precautions\nParents can help protect their children from serious diseases but following prevention steps like washing their hands thing up to date on recommended immunizations and using insect repellent prevent mosquito bites\nIn the case of Susan points on Avon he's healthy again he was treated with steroids and\nAnd using insect repellent prevent ... to buy\nIn the case

S. is trying to help Saudi Arabia cook up a process that will uh rather than putting out the facts put out a a a cover story that ah that supports the Saudi leadership\nWe should be demanding as American citizens that our government our our president's sector I state hold the Saudis accountable Jamal ... she was my colleague at the Washington Post but he lives in Virginia lives\nI was with his three children of this week uh who are American citizens we have a stake in helping them helping everyone understand the fact of how he disappeared and if he's dead I we was killed\nI'm great this morning Brian this is a risk exciting morning there's lots of things going on in the news and the next segment we're going to hear from the uh the new Nobel laureate a Nadia ... odd uh and uh they're going to talk about um [noise]\nYou know there was a lot of a war is given to people who are working on um\nAround the world working on a preventing sexual violence in the world and and that's an important topic and something that we are I personally want to be informed about if you are a person who likes to uh\nBe caught up on what's going on in the world and and making some informed decisions about the future of our world or you've already find MORNING EDITION that's why you're here that's why you're listening you made it part of your morning to catch up to\nUh know what's going on in the world because you listen to MORNING EDITION of well maybe you don't understand the part about this\nThat this is critical right now and that's why we're all sitting here this morning\nMORNING EDITION happens because of you MORNING EDITION happens because there's people just like you're willing to make a pledge of support\nAnd puts a few dollars up to make sure that uh we we can continue to him\nProgramming like MORNING EDITION and you say well you know I've been listening for a while now and and I haven't paid any money this is a voluntary thing is such an honor to feel there's very few examples in life that are like this it's a service you use all the time and yet you don't have to pay for it\nWe're asking you to do your part this morning by calling eight hundred six seven eight seven four four four going online to H.

I\nDid just on a simple life they they can they can leave we and group in Iraq and you've been here but they are they're very ... these people in the ... yeah they just want\nTo live in peace and can you say\nTo feel safe I talked to an audience brought in NPR's Washington studios earlier this week it was her first full interview since she won the Nobel Peace prize with the help of an interpreter she spoke mostly in ... which is her native language about what she now hopes to achieve\nUm diminution um ... we had set it over and over that it's important\nFor us the justice is done out of the six thousand UCD women who were abducted by ISIS we hope to see at least one ISIS number who did this to one me as a woman to be punished for the crimes they committed against gives me the women have and we hope to see them in court in public\nI think it is easy to see winning the Nobel Peace prize as a kind of combination or end of a person's career you've you've done what you said how to do\nIn your case it twenty four years old that is clearly not true you clearly feel like you have a lot less to do what is next for you after winning the prize\nAnd I'm twenty five twenty five [noise] and it just\nDidn't after I delivered our master and we have as a community delivered our message about how we would like to see the reconstruction of our homeland infringe are take place and to provide security for ... said that they can go back\nAnd we would like to see this never happen again not to any other community or any other religion or any other group are you angry\nAbout what happened to us in the ...\nI Can't just simply to say I'm angry because of that word only will not describe how much we have suffered but what I can say is that we are right we have the right to speak about this we have the right to deliver a message\nIf anger doesn't quite capture it what is the word what do you feel every day or\nChemicals to showed him a you know like I said what makes us feel good at least is that we are delivering a peaceful massive die we are not delivering a message to hurt anyone uh when I meet with students and presidents and anyone I speak about what happened to us and I deliver my message with a clear conscience\nThat I advocate for people\nDuring our half hour interview not humor odd seemed at times pretty shattered but also strong\nShe says that strength comes from her UCD identity she calls the rape of using the women and the murder of UCD men including many people in her own family a genocide she wants these atrocities to be classified as war crimes\nBut even after winning the Nobel Peace prize she's not sure if that's going to happen and she sometimes finds herself frustrated\nWhat goes on and I tried them and knew he sometimes I feel that my message has not been clearly heard what that is not my fault because I feel like too much is going on in terms of woman ... victims and it's not the first time and certainly it's not the last time\nAnd perhaps every year a woman someplace in the world or groups of woman or thousands will be victims of sexual violence or terrorist groups and so I feel like this is not new to people and it's not going to be the last time and people have become numb to this kind of news\nI'm your mother your mother was killed by the Islamic state and\nHave become numb to this kind of news\nI'm your mother your mother was killed by the Islamic state and I wonder when you think about her now\nWhat do you think she would think about everything that you've done what do you think she would think about you having won a Nobel Peace prize being the voice of the ... community to the rest of the world how do you think your mom would feel\nIn some of the yeah the ...\nWhen I received this news it was around probably five AM in the morning in the U.S and the first thing I did was look at her picture and cry but because they felt they needed her ... and not just her but the eighty women they eat him or women that were

Kathryn ... on a new episode every Friday on prime video\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Noel King more than me is a charity that aims to educate and protect Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie\n... she has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nLiberia who doesn't have a mom or dad agree on a street selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there are still on the street when you're free to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's set more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its undercut the mile or had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had alone background in doing various forms of\nGift community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand of six on an evangelical internship and then from there to continue the relationship with the country and she started the majority first registered in two thousand and eight\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and ... has been very clear in her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia was a man named Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\n[noise] I never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier [noise]\nUm and then in in West point out also being part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who are in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the area of West point where he ... he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\nCan you explain exactly what he was doing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nWas heavily involved in the recruitment of girls but he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using up\nFall from the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was going\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my life had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that the he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to that story in that after Macintosh junk Ken was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know

look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allowed the organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up with an organization like the local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local the local donor community I think I'm a local community had the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something had gone wrong in this in this organization but
