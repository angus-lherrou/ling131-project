Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court prompted a lot of discussion in all corners of American Life about sexual assault and specifically how young men are taught or not taught about consent a Jewish organization near Philadelphia has a program to talk about this and other difficult topics with teenagers\nNPR's Jeff Brady sat in with a group of young men\nIn the basement of a suburban Philadelphia home a half\nDozen high school freshmen boys are munching on chip and practice of thirty five year old group leader Cody green is introduces the week's topic raise your hand if you've

University of New Hampshire sociology professor Sharon Potter says older generations might remember talks for incoming college freshmen\nWe have a play and name any help them you know it can go and they went out and and he made and then we went and got to have you made\nThe problem says Potter is that only a small percentage of men are perpetrators Potter says a more productive approach is to train bystanders how to identify someone who may be at risk of sexual assault and then how to intervene Potter says this is hard work but not impossible\nWe've already done high anyway anti drunk driving\nDecades back most people were uncomfortable taking a friend's keys when they're too drunk to drive but after years of research and education programs the rate of alcohol related traffic deaths has been cut in half since the Nineteen eighties\nPotter says for sexual assault this kind of culture change is just getting started but look around and you'll find examples one of the teenage boys meeting in the basement says that as a high school freshmen he's all ready to use these skills I have seen\nSome stuff like a football game\nMatthew O'Donnell says he saw another guy touching the girl and trying to get intimate he wasn't sure it was a problem but just in case he made an excuse to separate them\nWhen I saw happening I was just kind of like oh I have to go to the bathroom in the bathroom was like on the other side of the stadium so I said come with me\nThe guy went with him and the potential problem was averted\nSharon Potter the sociologist says that's a perfect example of identifying a situation and then intervening she says more of that along with praise for people like O'Donnell could lead to the culture change that results in fewer sexual assault in the

behind\nDeport a group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg brutal scent of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nThat the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurgers and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why there's an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nMyrtle ... says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions fertile ... says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon dividends plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker the third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully ... to consumers\nBurleson says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it is a step\nThat's Vin Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist in political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but Weber says where the president and the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way of sugar coating it are Republicans today to embrace any new tax is difficult and since President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on us all fuels is even more difficult\nGreg brutal sudden acknowledges the challenges and says the carbon tax has always been viewed as a longer term effort\nNPR's
