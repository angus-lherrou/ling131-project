Steve Inskeep much is at stake this fall as Americans vote for Congress but in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage they were elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence and drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty twenty\nOne is the problem that you're trying to address\nWhat we're trying to deal with the problem a partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering or we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw lines that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to represent the the people\nLet's be blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that are slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine how\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build a\nI'm ... and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focused building up their bench\nNot only don't criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts and twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table in twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen if it will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team will be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so\nThe impact um that we want to have one twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electrical effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing and the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing it\nWe've raised I guess about a gift for over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting lens so governors always matter a state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor or the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter when North Carolina we're supporting and eat earls or who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for Rebecca ... who won a Wisconsin Supreme Court T\nR U campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nAll oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitutions as a they have been written\nThat we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally and I think ensure a a fair process\nOne of the attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made and what you lift off a famous remark by Michelle Obama\nWhen they go low [noise] they go low\nWe what did you mean or what I meant ... ... ... ... in that remark was that uh I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate well\nI certainly think through votes through protests um I I Would say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them\nLawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes um you know I I'd be going after them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump inauguration was very powerful and young people marched here\nI'm In Washington to ask for more\nAll when women came out today after the Trump inauguration was very powerful when young people marched here I'm In Washington to ask for more is saying ... gun safety measures those are the kinds of ways I think in which the people should or should express themselves attorney general holder

in the group or out which could lead to some awkward conversations if you were to win and that's not all\nLived in Bob where people used to play in a group a long time ago and then somebody wanted a single and then the group went after them said no we're always playing together\nVery awkward but curling is not entirely against office pools\nWell you know I I understand why people do it because

but in the long term there may be\nMore at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage they are elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others they will have great influence and drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced the Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty Twenty one is the problem that you're trying to address\nWhat we're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering or we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um represent the the people\nLet's be blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat one that is slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans in conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their badge\nNo I don't think I Would criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table in twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen who will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have one twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a little over thirty million dollars and we are distributing um the money\nI mean look at everything through a redistricting land so governor is always a matter of state legislators matter but in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor or the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter when North Carolina we're supporting an IED or else who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reason\nUm they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter so in North Carolina we're supporting and eat or else who's running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin Supreme Court cease\nFire you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a

for cyber security and privacy protection at the Cleveland Marshall College of law she believes insecure voting machines are the biggest security threat to the mid term elections and they are definitely insecure last summer at the DEF CON hacking conference security experts hacked and whacked at a variety of voting machines\nAnd came away saying the machines were hopelessly vulnerable to
