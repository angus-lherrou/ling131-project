Trump made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico traditionally what the US President do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel is closer or both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner and mom I've been following the crown prince I'm In Saudi Arabia or so it it would really be tough for Trump personally uh to do anything that would want to damage\nThis relationship with this one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at an intern in another country um to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm UC what he's been saying about the north Korean Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you were earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be\nIn another country um to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm UC what he's been saying about the north Korea and Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier a

true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase the pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's individual meeting with President pollutant in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore\nI'm looking at you and I can say that it is horrific\nUm for the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies caused flip the broad by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk\n'em I think the same thing is likely to occur these heavy Saudi Arabia\nAnd and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially because Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran or ... after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together\nIs the government known for intimidating their citizens who live abroad that did that surprise you in some way\nUm it it again it's it's gotten worse certainly um but he's been threatened before\nUm you know he was forced out of his job um he was

problem for the Saudis the Saudis overreacted to the Canadians are when the Canadian government took umbrage at a Saudi behavior\nYou will remember of course a just a year ago all of those Saudi princes that were detained or in the Ritz Carlton there were some reports of torture when that occurred didn't stop the U.S Saudi relationship from being extremely strong\nAnd again I just point you

week wasn't recap let's listen\nKansas gubernatorial contenders Laura Kelly the Democratic state senator and Kris Kobach the Republican secretary of state sparred again Tuesday night meanwhile three other candidates on the foreign stage tried to present themselves as the best alternative brain granite followed along\nMetal and Fox in Steven ... are here with me in Wichita and we all watched a gubernatorial form together one that included all five candidates many what were some of your initial thoughts\nWell first I think that it was all five candidates for a libertarian Jeff Caldwell and independent recluse this was a rare opportunity to share a stage with the three more prominent candidates Laura Kelly Kris Kobach and Greg Orman and they've been complaining sometimes even about the coverage that they've got\nSo here at this event you know they were really kind of introducing themselves they weren't talking a lot about the other candidates it was the basics of here's who I Am you know some of the policies I'm supporting Caldwell the libertarian or talked about marijuana policy in pardoning people convicted of marijuana fences\nClues talked about you know being dissatisfied kind of with both parties which they got to me a little bit with the the event is that I've been to a lot of these and Kris Kobach is usually really polished really sharp and tonight while he hit his key a talking point\nHe just kinda seemed on his back foot the whole time lurk Hollywood take a shot you know when we talk about going back\nThemselves they weren't talking a lot about the other candidates it was the basics of here's who I Am you know some of the policies I'm supporting Caldwell the libertarian or talked about marijuana policy in pardoning people convicted of marijuana offensive\nClues talked about you know being dissatisfied kind of with both parties which they got to me a little bit with the the advantages that I've been to a lot of these and Kris Kobach is usually really polished really sharp and tonight while he hit his key uh talking points\nHe just kinda seemed on his back foot the whole time lurk Hollywood take a shot\nYou know when we talk about going back to the Brownback experiment which is what Kris Kobach wants to do we're talking about cutting those schools again in Kobach\nWould be left to try to defend himself on the next question\nI'd like to begin by addressing something that Kelly just said it was so it continues to repeat ally over and over again claiming that I say schools are over funded and I want to cut school spending that is a false and she knows that my proposal if the change where we are spending the\nMoney shot reaction shot reaction and that meant Kelly never really had to face an upfront attack from Kobach\nShe was facing some some direct shots from Ormond though who came that Kelly a couple of times which does make sense they're aiming for some of the same voters particularly moderate Republicans and undecided voters\nYou know I I got to say here Brian I disagree with you a little bit at least I I think this was a secretary Kobach being kind of his normal rough and tumble self you know he hid Kelly on her past tax vote I think this was just\nKobach being Kobach he heard some things you didn't like and he took time to push back against them in his following answers um and they all kind of I think through some punches back and forth the major candidates I leave here and other discussion that was rather interesting between the candidates was their discussion on guns\nWhat are you guys think they're respond to say about which groups each candidate is according to me this really shows Kobach continuing to appeal to the conservative base of voters he touted his Second Amendment stances and he also talked about lowering the concealed carry why is it\nThat we say somebody who is Eighteen or Nineteen or twenty can carry a weapon in the U.S military but they can't defend themselves in a dark parking lot at night\nAnd Mark Kelly with again making her case Republicans by really hitting hard that she is a supporter and defender of the second amendment\nI Believe law abiding citizens ought to have a right to carry and I also believe they ought to have a right to hunt a I think all Kansas would agree with me though that we need to have some commonsense gun policies in our state\nIs ... saying look I'm a moderate Democrat and I I fit the state you can vote for me and feel good about it she was really walking a fine line here trying to appeal to voters of of multiple ideologies\nAnother topic that they that they came across was Medicaid or for the five candidates on the stage all agreed that it needed to be expanded Kobach was the only one disagreed\nYeah before I had a fake candidates run the same page about employment protection for ... people to come back again was the outlier thing he wouldn't read in Dayton executive order that Governor Kathleen Sebelius head and stated and a friend that Chris ended\nThe state should have no right whatsoever to discriminate against\nIndividuals I Would absolutely reinstate the executive\nOrder a further than that I Will try to actually get that into statute or I don't believe in him and his people\nI Will not a reinstate\nThe order on immigration to Kobach took a hard line while everyone else on the stage when it came to us to be a little more welcoming and in some way you know we saw on multiple issues that Kobach really paint himself has not the status quo and that's been kind of a theme in his campaign many Steven thank you so much for coming of his men which to\nThanks thanks for having a brain government Steven ... and Madeleine Fox or all reporters with the Kansas news service I mean do
