Rachel Martin we'd like to think America is the land of equal opportunity that depends on exactly where in America you Lance it's often said that you can predict the future as many kids by finding out that ZIP Code where they grow up\nAnd online data tool being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomist rice chatty has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunch the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties you said you were virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but\nYou see that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nShadi and your colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improve those shots so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program\nIt works a lot like Google Map you can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder of what are the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets but we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nFound that moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by it\nRacial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder border of the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets but we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nChatty founded moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people they didn't practical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten the head start on this effort back in twenty four team chatty and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you knew anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician so that ranking ran counter to Charlotte's image of itself as a thriving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\n... accent surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so\nI saw what she saw was a segregated city where a low income black residents especially faced little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThe group identified early childhood development college and career readiness families stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhanced upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at as to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have that right now it's just kind of share a map of median income\nAnd Charlotte said a lot of Williams from the Chinese team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets where a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte in clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility\nIf it's green or blue it has higher opportunity for\nThe outcome for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank Barnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is\nThe fathers for the Carolinas brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to\nAct on these data I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration of community partnership\nCharlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such field middle school it's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but it's just in principle Eric heartfelt says the schools students are mostly black and Hispanic\nSo we got forty eight point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body that's largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods\nThat segregation hinders upward mobility James e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced for now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have\nPoint nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body that's largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility\nJames e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with fetch fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now in an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now\nBut when in the coming years it changes it started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThe ... neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlet shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be a high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man the social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord said the opportunity at least should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us to start making really smart really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years and I don't know how we can look and say yeah that was the right call\nCharlotte is already taking significant steps in that direction Mecklenburg county which encompasses Charlotte has committed to providing pre K for all children the city of Charlotte has a fifty million dollar bond issue for affordable housing on November ballot\nRaj chatty says he hopes the opportunity atlas will help communities across the country revive the American dream in their local neighborhoods\nAll our name and do a soul you know to merge [noise]\nHow dark out his joined dozens

who are these two winners well the price is being shared of course by James Allison he's a Seventy year old biologist who's now with the NBA Anderson Cancer center in Houston\nAnd also by ... who's at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six\nNow you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes it's a complete surprise mail but not this year these names are on just about everybody shortly OK so not such a big shock but what exactly did these two scientists do\nWell I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties he was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer cells\nAnd it came across the part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes maybe the immune system would be more effective and attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to in fact\nWhat's been called the revolution in cancer treatment it would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard of that we talked about them a fair amount on our air and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers in the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alice and the other scientists who's winning us word ... how do you have any now that him a hundred work independently of Jim Alison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one in ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nOne example one of these drugs that you may have heard about us a drug called ... true to nuts that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar\nLine of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways they're more effective target huh fascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about cancer ...\nWell before the so I just made their discoveries catch her treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and the whole world of immunotherapy is known really the driving force behind drug development\nUs crude oil futures are up again this

as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive\nThe ring and maybe it's a reminder to get the shot the for Halloween Allison Aubrey NPR News\nOkay if you're looking for a cheaper health insurance then you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are\nNiche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington simply\nAnother choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products of them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage\nMore than ... eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people\nWho think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that deductible is met some people\nHave something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people Alison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health comes from exact science is offering color

Israel to still have affected security control of that area that leads to question are you willing to support a proposal that would give Palestinians equal rights civil rights full rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israeli citizen and what form would that tank well the\nBut you didn't work out what you're talking about the situation that prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of Israel but you want Israel to still have affected security control of that area that leads to a question are you willing to support that proposal that would give\nPalestinians equal rights civil rights full rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israeli citizen and what form would that tank\nWell they would have those rights than their own territory in other words they have their own parliament they have their own government have their own flag they have their own\nWell they have any of them back now but they have very very little writes compared to what the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer Ramallah origin then or now blues are governed by the Palestinians but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would ah endanger Israel\nNow this is a very odd to think where the Palestinians are demanding something that would collapse their own authority and their own government but it's not the first time that\nThey do so so I think we have to be realistic as long as the you know we have the middle east on reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best arrangement we could we could have a lot\nAnd you you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want to stay with Israel [noise]\nUh yes I Want to have that overriding power and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question\nHow come you don't see that much terrorism in a in the west bank well first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good I'm going to have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by off\nBut here's how it's done we have say intelligence about um uh terrorists in a one of the Palestinian towns\nAnd we would call up typically the Palestinian security authorities and say why don't you take care of it because I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't have to why should we you know and often we have to do because because we're willing to take the risk within attack as we weren't at the un by President Abbas so\nThey want us to take care of their security but also you know attack us\nInternationally final prime minister because I Know your time is very busy so I Hope you got the irony of what I said I understand I Do\nFinal thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that is carrying certain great benefits for you is there also a risk in being so closely aligned with such a polarizing president because you would rather as Israel historically has has bipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support in Israel is add a bipartisan support in and I believe will have a\n... in the in the future it's a very powerful bond there there's no risk with being so close to Trump well I think that uh you know you've seen that we could have agreements and disagreements with previous administrator for example we had a you know it's no secret of how to disagree with President Obama on Iran but at the same\nTime we signed an animal you are in the animal you are the memorandum of understanding guaranteed Israel a very important American security assistance for the coming decade and

what a new Curtis parliament could look like\nWell for the most part Rachel it's gonna be the status quo you know there are two main parties here that have existed for decades and they will continue

at least will do well\nHere's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThe most of the

of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control a lot of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties\nSo what does that mean to people with turnout good as a result of this frustration you were at polling stations right\nYeah that was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears has almost been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the u._k. immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in the very few polling stations ... and one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballots so there is an election official taking out each paper ballot because they decided not to do the automated their ballot counting because they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out the name of each party's very laborious process [laughter] so even a disapprove polling station which you'd think would be like supers hockey cleaning there were people trying to get in

Dream for years he's crunch the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you were virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but\nYou see that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that it it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard law to improve those odds\nSo they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like Google Map you can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the

Hispanic\nSo we got forty eight point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body that's largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility\nJames e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now in an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now\nBut when in the coming years to change it started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThat such field

the social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord says the opportunity at least should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us to start making really smart really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years not allowed to look and say yeah

individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are\nA niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington simply\nAnother choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years a stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think\nThat they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to your medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that
