Inskeep we're hearing all morning about elections in the United states let's take a moment to check on democracy in Afghanistan that country has been planning parliamentary elections this weekend most of the voting will proceed but in a very large and populous province\nThe voting has been postponed that after an attack that left to senior officials dead including a top police chief\nPamela constable covers Afghanistan for the Washington Post and she's on the line walking to the program\nI'm Glad to be with you I guess we should figure out what was supposed to happen this week and what is the original plan what's at stake and what's the campaigning bin Laden\n[noise] um the original plan was to have a very big nationwide election more than\nTwo thousand five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament for candidates of all all flavors and philosophers ah there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of star and worry\nPartly because of threats by the column on which has now come true awe and partly\nWidespread of widespread charges on that there was like a massive fraud and so you said a lot of a positive uh campaigning a lot of new fresh faces a lot of enthusiasm but also a great deal of of worry a A N and an anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been reporting that in Kandahar Province of really large and important province the voting will be delayed for a week but this does raise a question what is possibly going to be any different in a week\nKandahar Province of really large and important province the voting will be delayed for a week but this does raise a question what is possibly going to be any different a week\n[noise] right and we don't know that obviously this is a measure of taken on an emergency basis\nUm just to to sort of calm things down and kind of hard for very large province with this stuff last it's the least have its intelligence tastes and its governor has been gravely wounded um there's a huge security vacuum and people are very nervous and worried so I think this is obviously a measure designed for short term relief of that\nI'm obviously decision will be made later on I I Would take that help that that elections can be held there because it's a favorite populist lots and lots of voters but let's let's see what happens tomorrow um let's see if there's violence elsewhere or not\nUm and to what extent that happens how how bad it is I suspect a generally speaking out they're going to be taking famous one day at a time here\nDoes it feel and the rest of the country Pamela constable like a democratic process does do do feel like you're in the middle of a reelection campaign where the people's will might be expressed\nI'd do it does a it's been it's been a a a a nice experience so to speak out compared to previous\nElections here um you know record record numbers of candidates out and about a four hundred women are among the candidates with which is extraordinary up for a very traditional society like this\nOne up on the other hand candidates although they've been busy\nAn active have not been doing a lot of public campaigning they've ... they've been cautious they've had inside events um it had a loudspeaker trucks but you have not seen a massive public rallies a few have been held in the provinces and some of those have been attacked\nI'm so and and as we mentioned earlier hadn't hadn't candidates have been killed and\nWell okay Pamela constable of the Washington Post in Afghanistan thanks so much\nHere very welcome\nMm Mm that music means it's time for a story

are people on both sides of the aisle that really do want to work together that this divisive nets I really want\nTo believe that that's not who we are as a nation\nBecause it's it's amazing just as a journalist who watches these debates from afar um it seems like so quickly\nYou are labeled as someone who just wants to protect immigrants in this country doesn't care about the safety of people and people on the other side are labeled as racist and there's just no way to to actually build bridges\nThat is how it looks if you're reading things on the Internet but if you're out there in the community and you're walking with us you'll see that there's far more than it does bring us together then divides us\nAnd so you'd be ready to to to settle people down who were just calling the president racist and say that that's not helpful let's let's try and work through this\nI I Would do that I ...\nKnow that I Would actually be able to come out and say he's not racist\nTry and work

congressional district voters here might really help determine control of the house of representatives and we have been spending time\nListening to what is on their minds so this is Orange County it's home to the largest Vietnamese population in the United states' part of this district is actually known as little Saigon and the anthem trend lives here she works in community affairs for a utility company she is raising two kids\nOr parents also live in this community but she\nSays their lives and her's are so different\nMy parents are pretty much their lives are little ...\nAlso live in this community but she says their lives and her's are so different\nMy parents are pretty much their lives are in little Saigon my dad works at a pharmacy and so their lives are in the Vietnamese community right and for me I go out in the world I experienced racism I Know what it feels like to be discriminate against I I think my parents have it because really they have their lives or hear\nTheir communities here they go to a Vietnamese math they go to their customers are meeting these are our ... our diverse now I realize my experience as an American very different from my dad\nAnd these generational differences extend into politics older Vietnamese Americans have tended to vote Republican many of them fled communism and they see Republican presidents from Reagan on as being tougher on communist leaders some younger people like ten term trend has been leaning more democratic and that is one reason\nThe party believe they can unseat the Republican incumbent here\nSo when we went to visit the anthem trim we had heard there were some political differences in her family though I'm not sure she her so I knew quite helps dark they were\nAwfully high high\nShe invited us into her parents' home for kids were playing around with eating snacks and they were orbiting around the grandfather [laughter]\nHow trend is the ... father he primarily speak Vietnamese and his everyday life including when he talks politics with his daughter [noise] she's been backing Republicans since he first started voting in Nineteen Ninety two and he told me it would certainly no fan of president Barack Obama who he said just wasn't tough enough on the world stage\nWhom a window like him very much and then what now I guess we're today we have Trump what do you think of Trump so far [noise] sofa in this\nCountry who who do we do what do you like what do you have your ... your low uh-huh and um stock market in a row seat in Greece and to the economy is important to you yeah\nAnd that this is this is um I open\nIt [laughter] I didn't realize how he he thought of trying to we haven't talked about that or is this the first time yeah and I had a\nSurprise because then I'll have a conversation about the other stuff that he does against the media\nAgain like just civil society we grow up knowing how I'm democratic Vietnam edge the crackdowns on freedom of the press on basic human rights women don't have the same rights there and to see some of that happening now in America you know and some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine\nWe will be in a situation where we have a president that basically calling the press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam but we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that with the reality here today\nCould you say that you're dead and yeah I'm just I just wonder why\nWhen Trump calls the media enemy of the people what your reaction to that\nMenu alive like I'll go call your doctor you know there\nAre some time in the press talk about what the ... but they don't care about the food thing you're just has to CNN events drum riff off to both him\nSo they're not there by us yeah Fox News clearly is by it but I don't know if you're desert mountains of el\n... and a lot I think it'll apple I'm Trump boxes like try to you know make a phone [laughter]\nDo you think you think the media is too negative about Trump\nNot fair to say that Russia interfered in through the\nYou think you think the media is too negative yeah about Trump that\nHe's not fair to say that Russia interfered in through the election in this country mhm but when they know that\nWhy they don't last June before the election [noise] the way until from both elected and the Lakers too\nSo if if they find out that Trump worked with the Russians where that would that bother you yeah you don't you don't believe that yet [laughter]\nThey're doomed proven that I don't need to believe them\nYou know through the mud on either at me I just don't know which as I got\nNo doubt all he believes that the Mueller investigation should continue so that they have we have the facts I agree with that\nYeah so something you agree on yeah there are a lot of families who've been divided over their views of Trump what you hear like dinner conversations that yeah that go really badly in I mean people get it from the table yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this\nNo because I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one percent\nI clearly am strongly against you know what the president stands for\nBut I also believe it's important to you I mean I respect my parents I Know what their experience has fan and and we came here say that we can have the freedom to have different views to have this kind of conversation 'cause they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother him because we have that freedom and that's why my parents' lead Vietnam to be here in the first place\nEverybody got to go to vote yes you would fall toys and for future either we're thinking so you think everybody should vote yeah\nAnd my father I didn't mention any he ... after the war he was a political prisoner\nFor ... and the two year\nThree years he was held in a political concentration camp or not I have\nTo do a ... game\nYeah we're the communist tries to you know basically get him to change his thinking\nIt is powerful to hear you say that people
