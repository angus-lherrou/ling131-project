bars\nBeethoven clearly wanted these notes to be a strong masculine occurrence and he therefore orchestrated entirely with instruments that play normally in the register of the male singing voice\nThe flute being the instrumental equivalent of a soprano would be intruding here like a delicate lady at a club smoker so out came the flute\nAnd now let's hear how masculine it sounds without him\n[noise]\nYou see a lot of us assume when we hear the symphony today but it must have spilled out of Beethoven in one steady gush clear and right from the beginning but not at all Beethoven lifted pages and pages of discarded material in his own writing enough to fill the whole book\nThe men rejected rewrote scratched out tore up and sometimes alter the passage as many as twenty times Beethoven's manuscript looks like a bloody record of a tremendous inner battle before he began to write this wild looking school or Beethoven had for three years been feeling notebooks with sketches\nSome that he ultimately discarded is not right\nI have been trying to figure out what his first movement would've sounded like if he had left some of the men I have been experimenting with the music speculating on where these sketches might have been intended for use\nAnd putting them back into those places to see what the peace might have been had to use them and I've come up with some curious and interesting results let's see what they are\nWe already know almost too well the opening bars of this symphony\nNo once Beethoven had made the strong initial statement but then how does he go on to develop it it does it like this\n[noise]\n\n\nBut here is a discarded sketch which is also a direct and immediate development of the theme\n\nNot very good and knocked very bad taken over by itself but it is a good logical development of the opening figure\nOut what with the music sounds like if Beethoven to use this sketches the immediate development of his theme we can find out by simply putting the sketch back into the symphony and it will sound like this\n[noise]\n\n\nIt does make a difference doesn't it not only because it sounds wrong to our ears which are used to the version we know but also because of the nature of the music itself it is so symmetrical that it seemed static it doesn't seem to want to go anywhere and that is\nFake all at the outset of a symphonic journey it doesn't seem to have the mystery about it's the right version has that whispering promise of things to come\n[noise]\nThe sketch music on the other hand\nTo come\nThe sketch music on the other hand gets stuck in its own repetition\nJust\nDoesn't build and Beethoven was first and foremost a builder let us look at another rejected sketch here is one that sounds like this again it is based as all of them are on that same opening figure\n\nNow my guess is that he would have used it somewhere in this passage\n[noise]\n\nNow that she has the same passage with the discarded sketch included\n[noise]\n\n\nTerrible isn't it just gets Justin Trudeau itself into the living flow of the music and stands there repeating grounded until such time as the music can again take off and its flight now wonder Beethoven rejected for he of all people had a sense of drive through his music that his second to none\nThis sketch just doesn't drive\n\nAgain like the first one static in stuck\nNow this sketches different it has real excitement and build\nI suspect it was intended for a spot a little later on in the movement here\n[noise]\nThis is certainly one of the most climactic and thrilling moments in the movement it just the beginning of the code of the last big push before the ... and let's see how it would have sounded using the sketch I just played you\n[noise]\nNot at all that it has logic and the bills but what Beethoven finally did use has so much more logic and builds with so much more ferocity and shock that there is no comparison\nThe other all the good seems pale beside\nKnow here's a sketch that I really like because it sounds like the essential Beethoven style\n\nWhich has pain unit and mystery and the sense of a rupture and\n\nIt would have fitted very neatly into the coda harmonic ... rhythmically and every other way except emotionally here's the spotted Lakota I mean\n[noise]\n\nKnow let us at the sketch to it\nNo let us have the sketch to it [noise]\n\n\nDo you hear the difference what has happened\nWe had to come down from a high point to a low point\nIn order to build up again dramatically too was still higher point\nThis is in itself good and acceptable dramatic structure it happens all the time in plays and novels as well as in music\nBut this is no moment forwarded Beethoven is already reached his high point he was already in the last lap and he wants to smash forward on that high level right to be and and he does with astonishing Britain's\nIt is this genius for going forward always forward that in every case guides his hand in the struggle with his material like even the very ending was written three different ways on this orchestral score here is the first ending he wrote an abrupt typically ... ending\n[noise]\n\nWhy did he rejected it seems perfectly All right and satisfying but no he apparently felt that it was too abrupt and so we went right on and wrote a second ending that was more extended more like a few knowledge more noble romantic majestic it went like this\n[noise]\n\nBuddy on the manuscript this ending is also buried beneath the crossing out now he felt it was too long to pretentious perhaps to majestic it didn't seem to fit into the scheme of the whole movement where the main quality is beer economical direct statement of the greatest possible\nFor us and so he tried still a third ending\nAnd this one worked but the other thing is that as it turned out the third inning is even more abrupt than the first so you see he had to struggle and agonized before he realized so apparently simple as saying that the trouble with his first ending was not that it was too short but that it was not short enough\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomebody numbers vibrancy minor by Beethoven but New York
