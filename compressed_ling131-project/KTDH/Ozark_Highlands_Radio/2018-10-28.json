been looking really dark down here you know [laughter] [laughter] have you know some knobs\nSitting here thinking about how music juice seems\nTo transfer from generation to generation around here I guess\nA lot of that may be because of\nNot much coming in here and all the dirt roads were here the only way you could get to ... view as a dirt road that's right until gosh until\nThe end of the Nineteen seventies you know still county was really an isolated place I I don't I think the first blacktop road came in about around Nineteen sixty eight or so so it was pretty isolated here and I think a lot of that transfer you talking about has to do with these families there's\nMusical families here like we're just about everybody in a big family will play music\nThat's true in a ... do you remember the moody brothers I Do remember the moody brothers\nGarage on the east side of Mountain View that'll ramshackle building those guys they they could fix your car or build a mandolin\nThat's
