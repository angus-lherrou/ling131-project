coldest most winter prone sections of the state rarely get more than a dozen inches of snow in a year and that usually melts off in less than a week's time so no you need to go somewhere else to get your snow skiing fix\nBut believe it or not that wasn't always the case\nIn this final installment in our three part series on the story of dog patch usa we had back in the hills to find out just wind that Dickens people were snow skiing in Arkansas once upon a time and just what that had to do with the demise of one of America's most unusual theme parks\nThe owner of dog patch usa Little Rock businessman Jess ... was nothing of not ambitious in addition to his Arkansas theme park he claimed a bevy of other business interests some small some big among the latter was the development of a plan to model city on the outskirts of Little Rock the town of ... male\nUh fourteen thousand acre outdoor resort and the rug it Ozarks not far from dog patch and the history themed amusement park in

Seventy\nResort in the old confederacy marble falls generated a ton of publicity when it open for business a few days after Christmas in Nineteen Seventy two\nTo keep the slopes nice in white marble falls had to import snow cannons\nThe snow can is used electricity at a phenomenal rate as did keeping the skating rink frozen in fact everything associated with marble falls hemorrhaged money hundreds of thousands of dollars worth if not millions during the less than five years that the resort was an operation\nEven do dog patch usa was moderately profitable during these same years\nThe catastrophe that was ... falls into oh Tums other missteps became an anchor dragging the theme park toward insolvency both Marco Polo park into Odom Ozark Mountains outdoor resort went belly up to\nAdding insult to injury just a few weeks after marble falls shut down\nOur cap retired and the last installment of little Abner ran and funny pages on November thirteenth Nineteen Seventy seven caps retirement did not have an immediate impact on the popularity of dog patch usa but the gradual loss of cultural relevance in the coming years affected the bottom line\nNo matter how popular they once been a little Abner and his dog batch neighbors were now part of the dustbin of pop cultural history and that voted deal for the theme parks future\nAnd the following years high gas prices and a record setting heat wave took a toll on attendance prompting owed him to try unsuccessfully to sell out to an investment group looking to convert dog patch into a Christian theme park called God's patch\nBy the end of the Nineteen eighties season owed them with some three and a half million dollars in debt to Memphis bank the bank foreclosed resulting in the auction and good marble falls at the Newton county courthouse\nDog patch usa was also scheduled for auction but at the last minute a group of local investors bought the park\nNo longer burdened by marble falls the new investors nevertheless base the ever present challenge of the parks isolated location and the growing reality of the comic strip characters declining popularity so they adopted a new strategy in the early eighties relying on special event weekends and celebrity guests to click the turnstiles\nPast their prime rock groups like three dog not stepping wolf were featured in concert as we're up and coming country performers like Reba McEntire soap operas stars professional wrestlers and other celebrities helped depart turn a modest profit throughout much of the eighties\nBefore the Nineteen eighty six season the park sold for a final time to Melvin bell south Arkansas businessman who made a fortune cleaning up hazardous waste but caught a hankering for owning amusement parks when the stock market crashed in October of Nineteen eighty seven bells portfolio turned toxic\nHis business never recovered and dog patch usa by now and aging park in need of expensive upkeep an relying on outdated comic strip characters that neither\nThe theme park limp along on life support severing ties with the al ... state and the little Abner characters in Nineteen Ninety One in order to save money but it was all for naught and dog patch usa closed for good\nAt the end of the Nineteen Ninety three season\nIn the year since the old park has changed hands at several times each new owner resurrecting rumors of an impending reopening dog patch USA's Scooby Doo charm has attracted trespass or is in thrill seekers photographers and filmmakers\nThose who visited as kids end especially the hundreds who once worked summer jobs that dog patch usa remember that quirky remote park with fondness\nLooking back from the perspective of half a century from a world that is hyper vigilant\nRemember the quirky remote park with fondness\nLooking back from the perspective of half a century for a bit of hyper vigilance when it comes to not offending anyone or any group it seems almost surreal that apart founded on hillbilly stereotypes existed so recently in the Ozarks perhaps even more surreal than almost no one took offense\nThat's probably because those ... made the park their own no matter who actually owned the place\nThey co opted the negative stereotype and made the hillbilly a point of pride snow skiing in the Ozarks definitely not do Billy country maybe as long as the people back in the hills gets cold the Sean\n\nThanks Brooks I have to admit the not too many years ago I passed by the duck patch theme park which had been abandoned for many years uh jumped the fence and gave
