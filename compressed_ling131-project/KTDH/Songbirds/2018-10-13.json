posed for each other\nIs what is the first song that you ever\nFell in love with ever fell in love with\nSo uh I'm going to go first and my first song that I remember sitting down to truly listening to truly just allowing the lyrics and music to to penetrate me in and go get into my soul and resonate on a very deep level\nWas when I was a an elementary school my my latter years of elementary school\nAnd it was a song by counting crows great and great band yes yes counting crows and the name of it that song is round here and I have a kind of a funny Side Story that I Would love to ... to share with you um when I was in middle school\nThe the song is round here and I have a kind of a funny Side Story that I Would love to ... to share with you um when I was in middle school so the counting proceed with my first CD to ever ever purchase a independently purchase not the one that my parents bought me or something is one that I actually saved up my mind is to go out and purchase\nThat's the big one yeah life I think modern humans to let you lead [laughter]\nAnd uh when I was in middle school my house was rocked\nOh no it was wrong and they still a few things but when I was going through my room and looking for what had gone stolen from me the first thing that I noticed\nWas my counting crude CD oh my gosh that's terrible all my counting croup see my gosh [laughter] just makes me want to cry [laughter] uh well I went out and bought it again okay I couldn't live without it [noise] ah so this was in middle school let's fast forward if a few years and now I'm In high school\nAnd I was sad with my high school sweetheart and he was like hey I I really want to introduce you to my best friend I Would love for you to get to know my best friend\nAnd he said the name and I was like oh my gosh that's one of the seven guys who robbed my oh my gosh no way seriously seriously Angie I've had until the starting and others on the fly for her\nAnd um so I was like oh my oh my goodness and we went to his house and I met him and he was a nice guy he actually still is a friend of mine and I was leaving his room and guess what I saw oh my gosh I saw accounting crusading [laughter] and I picked it up [noise]\nAnd he saw me pick it up and I turned around and looked at him and he said\nThat your CD oh wow really [noise]\nAnd he gave it back to me oh my gosh
