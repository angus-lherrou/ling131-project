P. P. R. [noise]\nUm I grew up in the suburbs I'm not out out in the country like many of us here in in Kansas now and and the age BP are listening area for a little bit more rural than what I grew up in about halfway between Detroit in Ann Arbor up in Michigan [noise]\nBP are listening area for a little bit more rural than what I grew up in about halfway between Detroit in Ann Arbor up in Michigan\nBut one similar thing is that we lived in the same house for over forty years my parents purchased the house when my second ... older sister was born in the mid sixties\nAnd they lived there until um I had completed graduate school [noise]\nUm they lived there until just after a two thousand and one I think they moved to the retirement house that they built out in the country in uh June of two thousand one [noise] so\nUm [noise] what's interesting is to me is I started to think about this was\nMom and dad are still home but that how citizen that's mom and dad's house you can't see it but ... it made it very very understanding away [laughter]\nUm that's mom and dad's house now it's it's I have a guest room there and since I'm probably the most frequent visitor and sleeper and that guest room [noise]\nBut it's not really my room it's not home anymore and so it's a little a little odd that so that's part of what prompted this musical exploration of home [noise] [noise]\n... could mean so many different things you had so many different people and I do or what you just said for for me my home in the north west Kansas and all this county and its its farm that I wasn't born on but we my family were originally bought it just a run cattle and there was a house there and it was old\nAnd dilapidated but we would go out there on the weekends beginning when I was about eight years old\nAnd um my my parents eventually re did the house and this beautiful place now and go there and and it's it's mind special place uh-huh\nBut what makes it special is my family yeah and as much as I Would love to be able to claim that as my home my forever home there will always be a part of me their boat but if my family is not there than it's\nRight and it's then home becomes redefined it that apple it lately absolutely I the last\nTime I visited Michigan I actually drove into the neighborhood and pass the house that I grew up in and that it was odd there's there's been some I I think there's been some of this issue here as well but um [noise]\nThe ah there's a beetle that has had gotten into the trees and and forests in Michigan [noise]\nUm [noise] and has destroyed a lot of trees even into the suburbs not just in the wouldn't lands but in the suburbs and this neighborhood that I grew up in that you know every there was trees along every boulevard and trees and every yard has been [noise]\nCan kind of suburb B.D forested well I guess it can cause it just looked very very different and of course there's been a couple of different owners of that house now and they've re painted and it's different colors and\nBut there by when I was growing up my father built a little I'm just three bricks tall little brick wall that kind of framed\nThe driveway and some of the landscaping and that still there's so there's still a little bit of Lyndon mood is that how on ivy would lanes\nSo [noise] it I'm reminded of that saying leave only footprints and take only memories and those memories can become your home there only a FAA they absolutely can do you feel like you're at home here on the\nAnd those memories can become your home they're only ... at the age they absolutely can do you feel like you're at home here on the high plains now I'm getting they're getting there [laughter]\nGood good good I'm getting there yeah\nThey'll spend a little bit of an adjustment it's not good not better or worse yet are good or bad but it it's different than it's taken a little adjusting but you know I didn't come here from Michigan I came here from New York City so\nWe little change I Would say yeah\nAnd I can really tired\nBall ball [noise]\n\nLead us they might know a\nBand in time and you\nIt's a little thing\nI ...
