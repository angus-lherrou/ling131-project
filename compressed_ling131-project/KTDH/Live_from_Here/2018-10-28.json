friends will be looking for where they merged do did they live in a magical land should I Try and return them to his hollowed out\nTree [laughter] I felt bad for him so he took his big white hand in mine and walking down the street have you ever gotten looks from strangers\nOn the street and you knew without a doubt they thought you in the summer for lovers [noise]\n\nWe try to reach racist steps
