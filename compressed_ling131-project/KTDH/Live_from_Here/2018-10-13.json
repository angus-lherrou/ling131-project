travelling correspondent comedian Tom Papa in a segment we call out in America Tom are you\nThere I'm here Chris on behalf of live from here I'm continuing my journey across the country trying to shine a light on all the good people in America this week I traveled to Detroit Michigan the motor city Motown and the hometown of my buddy Josh\nIt was a beautiful week with bright sunshine in warm weather that had the locals rolling their eyes and saying it wouldn't laugh\nBut despite their feelings about the weather there is a real optimism in Detroit after years of clothing auto plants bankruptcy and corruption people are doing something new they're moving back into the city again\nMy neighbor driver was a man named Howard he was born and raised in Detroit was very excited to give me A Guided tour as he drove me from the airport through downtown\nDetroit had a bad reputation he said after the riots people were afraid of Detroit and then corruption bled the city dry but there's a new generation that has no connection to that in a way all we went through and all that damage enabled us to start fresh and go our own way\nDid you write has truly beautiful architecture was gorgeous homes in churches but its revival seems to be happening block by block a gorgeous street with children playing outside is followed by homes that have been burned down almost to the ground\nOn the next but there's a strong sense that it's just a matter of time before those or change as well have you ever had a new driver who was so excited about is city but he put his car on auto pilot so we can turn around and talk to you while he was driving but his car didn't have auto pilot I have\nBut Howard knew these roads so well he hardly needed this year I tell everyone he said people don't ruin city politicians ruin cities\nAbout it [noise] who tells us things are bad foods held his our neighbors are the enemy\nBut there's a strong sense that it's just a matter of time before those or change as well have you ever had in ... driver who was so excited about a city that he put his car on auto pilot so we could turn around and talk to you while he was driving but his car didn't have auto pilot I\nBut Howard knew these roads so Eli hardly needed this year I tell everyone he said people don't ruin city politicians ruin cities\nThink about it who tells us things are bad food tells us our neighbors are the enemy\nWho tells us things can't be done not the people the people believe we're the ones opening florist shops and restaurants it's really happening and I'm blessed to be a part of it he said\nAnd when you come back to town you'll be sitting in my new coffee shop and you'll said damn how are you are right Detroit is beautiful\n[noise] have you ever had to ride from the airport there was so inspiring an emotional that you had to get a drink before he checked into the hotel\n[noise] I [noise]\nMy hotel was Greek town section that Greek neighborhood was once filled with immigrants but it's now mainly loud sports bars and strip clubs with Greek name I slipped into a quiet authentic Greek restaurant and was greeted by a bartender named stab rooms\nEven excited by my last name pop or your Greek I was about to tell them it was an Italian name\nBut he took out a bottle of who though and we toasted to our greatness I wanted to correct them but it was too late with each shot\nI met another family member his father his uncle the sisters they brought up salads and ... and ... have you ever had a great bartender greet you so warmly that you decided that maybe you should have shown your entire family history\nAnd be [noise] I had [noise]\nAnd who knows maybe I Am ... my family is from Sicily which is Italian now but for a long time it was populated mainly by the Greeks so maybe I'm Greek after all to be honest after a bottle of who though I was willing to be anything [noise]\nAs we continue with our family reunion the doors of the play swung open and very loud bachelorette party came in the bride to be with Laura she was wearing a giant sparkle filled tiara\nAnd her bridesmaids were screaming like dolphins and dresses there at the end of their life and we're holding drinks in one hand and their shoes and the other [noise]\nLawrence said she's totally psyched to be getting married and that her fiance is a totally cool guy and they're going to be totally happy she said it over and over and very loudly in front of ... and it became clear they had dated at one time and she was looking for if I [noise]\nHave you ever been so drunk on Greek liquor that in order to protect your new ... brother you let a conga line of bridesmaids out of the bar and into the streets of Greek town\n[noise] I [noise]\nI woke up the next morning with a headache wearing a beat a necklace and holding a very inappropriate swivel stick\n[noise]\nI wandered down stairs grab a coffee and waited for a cab rides the Motown museum I sat on a bench next to a man named Mohammed\nHe was on break from his job at the hotel it moved here from Syria and the Nineteen nineties when Syria was still at peace Mohammed said I didn't look so good\nTold them about my Greek ... party he laughed and said this is why doesn't drink [noise]\nAs we're looking out across the avenue a car that someone else off and another haunted him and then an old lady on the sidewalk gave everyone the finger including us you see this is why don't fight with people you said\nEverybody is so filled with stress\nThomas [noise] he was on break from the job of the hotel you moved here from
