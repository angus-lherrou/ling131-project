during the summer before I started to grade after being with us for a year Susan got another job\n\nLast time I saw it was Christmas Eve Nineteen eighty two sixteen a cashier at thrift wasted supermarket in Cincinnati where I Lived\nThe place is packed all twenty five registers or going people are lined up halfway through the back of the store I look up and this isn't Jordan\nShe smiles we talk she doesn't have many items so I checked them through as well as I possibly can I Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married\nShe has me some kind of business Kern her husband's probably something having to do with the building of redwood decks she seems happy\nMeanwhile there's a line of last minute Christmas shoppers mounting behind her\nAnd tell her to hold on I'm trying to get my break we can catch up she took great steps aside\nI keep signaling to my manager but there's no one to relieve me\nFive ten Fifteen minutes that\nI keep Clinton behind Susan making project gestures I can still remember standing there holding on one bag of groceries smiling back at me\nFinally she tests man the shoulder\nI have to go she says but I come in here all the time I'm sure all the around\nI worked at two or three for two more years I never saw Susan Jordan again\nThat drives me crazy that I never saw her again [noise] [noise] if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care but somehow having her play with him he seemed like a huge role in my life when I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it would be like to talk with her as a peer\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of\nThinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things about me I just had to find her\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers that I Know I'm I'm a do you want to know I'm calling\nI Do I Do you remember she was in Jordan right\nGeorge\nWhy did you want to get off of it\nBecause my family wouldn't didn't functional that my mom and it was pretty bad [noise]\nThe girl that I Lived with\nAt that time she was taken all of a truck and her boyfriend and every time I Would come home they would always try to get me to take drugs with them or something and I I really do it much at all and um it was really\nIt was it was tough to come home and I I guess I must have been suffering a little bit I missed I really miss my little brothers\nAnd my little sister and they were gone and um I Would\nI guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember used to find that that was because I think it worked both ways I think that we felt\nIf that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we bonded and well\nI was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it [laughter] it's only you knew you probably wouldn't make that I mean they're people are complicated now what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I\nI just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy and know a lot of times they it it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out [laughter] and I'm sure they were [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo you sort of talk to us instead\nYeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise]\nOh\nEvery time the subject of are hard times came up I hear a subtle hesitancy and Susan's with\nThe person I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't exactly it wasn't until\nWe've been talking for hours that I realized when it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to\nAnd that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me to it\nI don't think I was kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but ah\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but uh I Would be devastating if I heard anything different\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go back to ... parts of yourself you don't want to go back to produce and Jordan Europe or life that I remember is he or she just too soon forgot\nAnd it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like but\nI didn't think of myself as where at all but Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible when I was nine of anxious and bookish it was kind of uptight\nNot the same as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play when I went to your rooms I didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of\nToys I Hope I've got this right but it just seems like they were mostly folks and more educational things I mean I remember you had planned it in your room and a chemistry set and I didn't remember that cake had hardly any dolls\nYou didn't seem quite as playful as other kids that I had they not just in more serious in general mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nAnd\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story how little I memorized the cheapest about each other or even if they had received us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we needed to about the other I needed to remember the part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her talking about in the face of hardship she said she mostly remembered the side of my family but I just take for granted that it was common our house that there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that keep people lived differently than the way I left and that's what I decided I wanted for myself\nAnd you can try to return to childhood by looking at photos are visiting the old neighborhood or listening to recordings more you can find someone who knew back then someone you haven't seen since the don't carry with them themselves the picture of do this on clouded by the years

very clearly although I don't I don't say that some of the\nDiary that it was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel and [laughter] I mean [laughter]\nThat that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know\nThe the thought of a young Zionists to be prepared is way too\nIt'd be very important for history for people to know\nThe the thought of a young Zionists did he prepared its way to meet his nation [noise]\n\nThat are are regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience\nIn Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this\nDiary remain other sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me\nOne thing is the lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude sickened me huge ... of the world's stop worrying about money and

Capitol [laughter]\nWow [laughter] [noise]\n\n\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership [laughter] oh that's a that's a kind of thing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter]\n[noise] yeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about\nIsrael\nSure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] make amazing that you're in your prime minister of Israel and and what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will

eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda\nThey blame the Jews for everything in the world including Jews go along with it entirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and anyone who would read it would immediately become\nAs scientists [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this\nRidiculous fantasy\nOf you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know\nI mean it was like maybe the maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation ... ... maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy\nYeah I think um\nDidn't have much anxious about being the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident uncomfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other\nMuch anxious about being the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much a mixed about every other aspect of my life [laughter] I Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this\nWith with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great\nMm Mm [noise] I Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel\nIt knowing that finally you know an audience of a million people was was getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so\nNothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel\nAnd and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect millions of people like how is that enough motivation you know just to have your petty little\nCraft and your petty little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nYou know it just seemed pathetic\nAnd I mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself\nWhen you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at your thirty year old [laughter] just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at\nSixteen yeah that's very true yeah he would be very very disgusted to be heard this this radio to ease\nIt would seem like I had settled in the ... that are way\nMm\nI'm Adam\nDavidson these days staff writer for the new\nMm\nBoy when we were angels\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and we frankly studying drying at the New York Academy of art and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get on to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that you had gotten what you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like a story from this American Life now for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio for this week's show however we had her put together another story using that same style\nWhich we added music to hear the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nIndustry about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nHalf the university is it pretty straight place entertainment for most people means fraternity tigers it's not that sort of place you'd expect people to watch a guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four my friend's got with the top half\nIt was beginning of the school year and we were [noise]\nAboard one night and we decided to go up to the crowd and [noise]\nI guess basically got up on a on going back and they started yelling and screaming about how giant he was and how that never had any [noise] I think actually right after that I might have gone back and said yeah you know I also try it\nHe was and how back never said he was and I think actually right after that I might have gone back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter] and uh I guess that really struck a chord of thought that was\nPretty amazing\n... ... ... ... ...\nThey bought a lot about it I'm\nGood at actually good you know start me thinking along [laughter] killer pat\n... ... ...\nScott talked about the idea one night in the dining hall the next day on the way to class\nHe saw signs all over again that that enabled me I Am nine feet tall and see giant man eight pm on what\nScott had no idea who put them up he learned later that the science were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner got decided he would go to the cloud to specify time and undertake the challenge to pull this off\nHe would need to create a character in costumes for the giant he gave a giant man a booming boy\nI don't even know exactly it was something like you know I'm I'm trying you know just the you know loud but just kind of weird [noise] you know sort of [noise]\nSuggesting enough [laughter] you know I don't know and\n\nGot asked his college friend hold on
