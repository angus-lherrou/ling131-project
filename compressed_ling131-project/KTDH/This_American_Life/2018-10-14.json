Twenty years of shows to play for you\nAnd I had a lot of fun actually looking through a we had this a patron website where the producers of our show just a list and then write little blurbs about their favorite stories that we've ever done\nWhich by the way if you haven't seen it and you're looking for something to listen to you and your commute or whatever I totally recommend that any way using that I have lined up a bunch of stories today that have not been on the air and forever and there are really special I started with this one this is from Sarah candidate who's now the host of art shows you the truth is broadcast in\nTwo thousand nine and it's about a fight over who gets credit for certain ideas so but the story about her dad Julian\nAll my life I've heard the hallmarks of my father's achievements I invented some wrestling that was in Nineteen thirty six when he was a counselor at camp gridlock for boys they already had arm wrestling for the boys and leg wrestling\nBut rigid another wrestling I invented some wrestling with the same rules as a hockey puck face off on true free go\nJust came to like just a stroke oh we should use their thumbs\nReserved for her it was ... devastated mom or [noise]\nThe discoveries kept coming shrimp for instance I was popularized shrimp in America\nIn Nineteen forty one and my father shrimp lover with the courage that there were only two places on Broadway in New York where you could get shrimp [noise] but then in Biloxi, Mississippi in there with me here because the story barely makes any sense so he's in Biloxi on his way to Mexico with somebody\nAnd he says government boat about to go out to track the migratory paths of shrimp and he talks his way onto the boat by explaining that he loves shrimp apparently\nAnd he goes out on this boat and they find the ship breeding grounds or some such and the rest of course is history\nThen practice in New York our patrols broad right here on your own [noise]\nOr miss re chartered by popularized shrimp aircraft survivor [noise]\n[laughter] really really fit evidence that you\nPop [laughter] right here in the [noise]\nFor a moment just for\nMy dad does make a claim on the word character that he came up with the idea to use it to mean a person as unusual or eccentric qualities you have a character\nWe're gonna play of course but it was a very common usage as he's a character\nAnd what made you do you remember why you started using it\nFired for a shift of adopted her for Goldman barrel our fingers but he's developed for our type\nFired for a trip to the doctor for Goldman Barrow figures or deserve our for our procedures\nAccording to my father Norman Mailer also said he invented some wrestling mailer who died in two thousand seven was a famous dumb wrestler but not its inventor because as we now know my dad invented it a camp gridlock for boys and that's the rub you can't prove the origin of any of this stuff and it's annoying when people like Norman Mailer take credit\nMy dad would like people to recognize him for his contributions to shrimp and character and so I'm wrestling but he's not going to make a stink if they don't his real legacy though in advertising that's another story that he's willing to fight for and he has been fighting for it for decades\n[noise] my father was a legendary copywriter\nYou wrote time it takes it looking and keeps on pickings he named Earth Day Earth Day it falls on his birthday April twenty second birthday birthday so the idea came easily magazine Advertising Age made a list of the top one hundred advertising campaigns of the twentieth century\nThe Marlborough man is on it and they Energizer Bunny good to the last drop from Maxwell House and the keep America beautiful crime Indian but the number one at the top of the one hundred list think small [noise]\nThat was Volkswagen's American campaign to sell the beetle in Nineteen fifty nine and my father wrote in the picture of a tiny car on a big white page and some other news self deprecating copy\nThat I'd would fall by lemon another VW ad so iconic and made it onto the TV show Mad Men the shows that in Nineteen sixty about an ad agency that slightly behind the times\nIn this scene agencies creative team contemplates the lemon ad\nOr want to hear about the most did one last year saying smoked for over six small pager full page you could really see the pros [noise] you're\nAt the time these ads were revolutionary in the beginning there was a Volkswagen another famous New York ad man wrote that was the day when the new advertising agency was really borne here's another scene from Mad Men when Don Draper the agency's creative director interviewed some new talent after he looks at their portfolio he handed it back to that with this line\nWill find a way of showing phonics conference however\nIt's Julian Canucks actually my father and what does irritated him for so long it's not that he is not recognized for talent I mean the people who write madman clearly no who is\nIt to some of his best work has been claimed by someone else\nMarty insurance the greatest predictor of my work was by one charm part you know George Wallace was your most arrows and challenger all director just genre\nOn this issue tolerance is owners shooter by ... I'm never ... you go [noise]\nSo we're wars for it or burn\nIt shut up to ... what's the word would be we did it regardless of who originated your word for word rigid [noise] evaporated from George ...\nIf you've heard of anyone in the advertising industry it might be George Lois he's well known for a lot of things but maybe especially for its provocative and funny Esquire Magazine coverage from the Nineteen sixties like the one of Mohammed Ali posing in Saint Sebastian but before that George Lewis worked at building burned back instead of my father\nIn Nineteen sixty they both left Haiti and joined up with another guy Fred peppered to form their own upstart agency called ... ... lower\n... wouldn't talk to me for this story I'm not going to get into a sophomore fight with a disgruntled ex partner he wrote an an email I Can't say blaming had mixed feelings about this fight\nI'm not going to get into a sophomore fight with a disgruntled ex partner\nHe wrote an an email I Can't say blaming next feelings about this fight [noise] of course I Want to stick up for my father take his side\nBut I've also thought there's something inherently undignified about the whole thing like it's beneath my father to care whether or not George lowest is taking credit for this or that slogan from Nineteen sixty two so I never really paid attention to the details until now lately it's been coming up more or at least more publicly so I started asking questions\nAccording to my father it all started with the Harvey ... account Harvey ... elegant modern furniture my dad says he came up with the ad a beautiful chair with a match book under one leg and a line if you're Harvey ... straighten your floor to copy that went with it that he thought was very good and the a\nYear or so later or a couple of years later\nI'm\nRon Holland or a a friend of mine\nAh came running through my office to say ... drop it is a editorial writer very rich have you with him on his climbing your hobby ... of the road it so I called George I'm In my office\nAnd rubber shredded says what men do frequently with him\nAnd uh his show so I'm not very shy I Would never say that\nI knew one doctor's office and a little while later Ronald ... draws said I told her son numbers on it I got it all\n[laughter] yeah I mean if you told you oh told me where to get off so that was really the start of it\nIn Nineteen Seventy two George Lewis published a book first of many about his career called George be careful in it he describes going to the Harvey ... furniture factory in Massachusetts and my dad\nEach chair was placed on an electronic test platform to be sure it was absolutely level low of ...\nGot a book of matches I ask Julian heavy smoker\nHe handed me a match book and I split it under one leg of the chair on the test platform I've got the ad I said if you're Harvey proper chairs crooked straighten your floor Julian scout and shot back\nIf you're hardly ... straighten your floor that was the way the ad ran and that was the way we built the first red hot creative agency\nA number of I'd ever happen but it was destroyed by George is a nursery for my ... and ... and under the lady who was sure I'm sure I've got the number of his is true\nAdvertising is a is broke drawing puff or a or at heart destruction\nAnd I don't hear anybody can feel proud are you in the next world rivers for rare bills on deception even know no matter how well you\nYou're not necessarily proud that you had a career in the field of advertising and then and that's your legacy but you are proud that you were the best in the business at the thing you chose to do\nWhen I started to show to better myself [noise]\nMm [noise] Mm [noise]\nIf you could go back she's another career my father would have liked to have been an environmentalist of some kind\nWhich is why he'd really like to be remembered for something almost nobody knows he dead naming Earth Day it agitated him to look up Earth Day on Wikipedia recently and not see his name anywhere so few days ago added in\nUm [noise]\nThey're ... years since we first broadcast that story that Julian died he was Ninety three these as of course there has to Syria which if you have not heard ... third season where she spends a year in one courthouse and fines and credible and revealing stories that have so much about the criminal justice system that is not what we're here to talk about though\nThis is the pledge drive and this kind of story\nAbout Sarah is dead I just like the story like that can exist in the world that that person or an emotional and also about bigger things like what it is to look back on your life and what you have done\nI just I just like it it just gets to me and and we put these stories on the air hoping you feel the same way and say like asking for money for something like that like it's a weird exchange okay like basically asking you\nTo swap your feelings wings story gives you for cash that then you hand to the radio station like I Know that's weird and I know it's weird for you to go on line and call and pay for something that really most of you listening right now are getting for free that is inherently weird [noise] then I Would just say\nSarah and I and so many people that are showing that this radio station like we are doing something weird also like we are coming\nSarah and I and so many people that are showing that this radio station like we are doing something weird also like we are coming on the air all the time [noise]\nKind of with our like our hearts on our sleeves saying like okay this is what we think is important to talk about today or or any way like here's a story that gave us feeling that we think that might do the same for you [noise] like that's a weird thing also in a way like it's all weird\nAnd and I would just say like you come to this radio experience like from your side and we come to it from our side and same to you from our side of the radio from where I'm sitting\nLike I think it's fair that if you like the stuff that you're hearing if you like what you're getting out of this exchange this weird exchange I think it's fair that use help it exist just like I help it exists from my side all of us here at the radio station company just from our side [noise]\nThat seems reasonable to you first had applied\nIt's quite simple all you do is you pick up that phone and you call one eight hundred six seven eight seven four four four [noise]\nYou are listening to hide plant or do you are listening to high plains public radio but you're listening to this American Life in a a show which has been on the radio for a long time I don't even know how how long at this point but a very long time\nI'm Brian ... by the way I'm joined in the studio by a Bob Davis who is the executive director of high plains public radio hello Bob good afternoon Brian and this American Life\nBob is not only a show that has been around for a long time and a lot of people know about it's one of the more popular shows in one of the shows that ... public radio\nHe gets a lot of feedback on all of the community members that seems a listen to it and tell us how much they like\nAbsolutely that is what they tell us and speaking personally there are certain certain ... bits of music that you hear you've never heard them before and often times maybe it takes a few hearings and you go oh I think I like that then there are certain songs that you hear the very first time and you think\nOoh that's good that's good and and speaking personally the very first time I heard Ira Glass on this American Life which was more than Twenty years ago\nI was hooked at five minutes oh this is good this is different and this is this is long form in a high plains public radio and National Public radio they excel at long form the ... the idea of a [noise]\nTelling a story and but not letting that the narrator of that story a run out of breath you know we have a little breathing space and even with that this American Life is special I Believe because uh we develop characters here I think it's no accident that uh\nThe Ira and the uh the the cash there at this American Life for first each segment as an act it is an act that has a beginning it hasn't middle that has an aunt and we learned fascinating characters and the reason that we're breaking in here right now is because\nWe're trying to add some characters to our cast are cast of supporters of high plains public radio it's very simple to uh to join this class you know and and uh to stand up and say I I support this sort of programming\nThe number to call is one eight hundred six seven eight seven four\nFor for that is the correct phone number Bob and uh you know getting back to the to the analogy that you're making this I I Love that analogy by the way and it's absolutely correct as far as I can tell but I Want to point out here too but coming aboard the high plains public radio cast\nEverybody is a star and there are no supporting characters no supporting roles I just want everybody to\nThe high plains public radio cast\nEverybody is a star and there are no supporting

community license radio station there are other public radio stations NPR affiliates out there that are involved with the universities\nOr or other you know um states organizations that's what type of thing high plains public radio is a community licensed radio station and what that ultimately means is again\nYou own this radio station we do not have to answer to any uh any advertisers to any sort of of of authoritarian role but it's going to step in and say no that's not allowed and that is the reason why you while you listen to high plains public radio\nIf you want to support high plains ...

M. A. M. A. dot org\nIs there a glass of this American Life and if you have any say these words right now is are you listen to this radio station but you do not pledge and I say that because most people listen to public radio don't pledge I guess got a medical resident I met on the street\nTo listen to a lot like three hours a day\nBut you don't pledge listening for a while\nMaybe I should maybe I should\nJust walk into why you don't I just like you know I've [noise] like I did grow up with it I was in it I can to NPR and that I imagine the view and then I met her and so it's like if you brought the guy\nWho actually extending a forty fifth street in New York City just up the box in the play that he and his wife they've only been married for two months we're in the way that the\nLike how much you get paid for your Lion King [noise] by with a guy on the other thing is something age ... and you'll be in there for how long\nAre the only either going I get your point [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] keep a thanking picking on Broadway [noise]\nHundred nine dollars for two and a half hours long\n[noise] he's basically paying forty four dollars an hour [noise] just did that show [noise] and\nTwo and a half hours long he's basically paying forty four dollars an hour [noise]\nJust did that show [noise] and not to get that show [noise] but if he would have paid this media says [noise] at the same is decorated\nWith three hours a day that he listen [noise] his pledge [noise] would be forty seven thousand seven hundred and forty two\nI talked to three other officials were involved in the hundred and twenty day group to who's still work in government and they all felt like Barbara let's put our back into it focused hit the target so they do it they meet they divide into groups they write up a report that makes a bunch of recommendations are classified\nMy impression from Barbara and the others who worked on this was we implemented every improvement we could imagine to a process that was already tight and the final conclusion of this group of experts was if you Institute these improvements into the process that we already has for sure it is safe\nTurn the program that go ahead and started meeting the refugees again with the more extreme vetting that you want it [noise] and\nProgram back on the go ahead and start admitting the refugees again with the more extreme vetting that you want it [noise] and then on about day a hundred and ten of the hundred and twenty days they hear back from the White House\nThe White House did not lake the conclusion if this review and according to Barbara and the other they spoke to in the group the White House wanted it to change\nThat express concern about the recommendation to resume refugee processing of all nationalities and do you know which nationality and the White House was worried about\nTrying to say this record is probably not\nI was told that there were particular concern about I'm slowly nationals the\nAdministration specifically pointed to Somalis at the sticking point why\nI don't know what do you think\nI honestly can't speculate\nYou don't want to say no I don't think I to this day I don't know and there's no rationale the\nYou were given like because Somalia is\nLike this for like\nThe rationale wasn't shared with me\nTo government officials confirm this for me Somalia wasn't the only concern they said but it was a major concern is chief of staff John Kelly in particular was unhappy they said I think it was both one guy in the group told me at the end of the day the data didn't show that Somalis were any special risk\nSo after a hundred and twenty days the White House reopen the refugee program\nFor some countries but not for a handful of countries who make up a lot of the refugees resettled here for Somalia intent others including all the countries in the original travel ban the refugee program would states suspended for them the hundred and twenty to review got another Ninety Days\nMy bought asked me to think about options for how to address the White House's concerns\nHerbert says she and the other members of her group or sort of at a loss for what else they could possibly review\nBut they went back to work they came up with some more recommendations\nAfter Ninety Days in January twenty team the White House did we start the whole refugee program\nBut it was like turning on a faucet and nothing coming out if you look at Somalia and the ten other countries the fiscal year it looks like we will admit three percent we allowed the year before last year we admitted more than six thousand Somalis\nThis year to two hundred and fifty extreme vetting has gotten so extreme deem that you people can actually get through it barber said the changes they recommended shouldn't have had this effect it shouldn't have slowed things down so much there's spoke to from the groups at the same thing [noise]\nIt's not clear why the numbers are so low but Barbara and the other people I talked to said the White House just never supplied the staffing and the resources to carry out the new vetting a few people told me that the FBI in particular isn't staffed up enough to do the checks it's supposed to do\nAs a result there's not a ban and plates on these refugees but the outcome is nearly the same digits spokesperson for the new screen procedures aren't doubted we making America safer they point to one specific example in Iraqi wanted for murder in Iraq who entered the United states through a refugee program and twenty four team\nThey said today with the new vetting procedures he would not have made it through [noise]\nThere was some rich with every immigration program if you wanted a zero risk immigration system you wouldn't have any immigration at all\nYou know my sense is that the out of the risks tolerant of this administration um\nBeen very very low with regard to the refugee program you know approaching zero\nAnd that's an ashtray and I'm\nVery very low with regard to the refugee program you know approaching zero\nBarbara thanks so I Believe the jets were denied us that they just want a different kind of refugee coming in any come in at all and she and another staffer told me about various times going up the hill to talk about the refugee program to Congress back when Jeff Sessions with senator\nDo that for culture yet another time she saw someone else who now jump official gene Hamilton for briefing to screen for integration potential Hamilton half the ability to assimilate now she said\nThat's something we've always taking pride in actually as a country and she told him that standard for refugee resettlement has always been vulnerability how much can we do for you and how much you can do for us\nSo he chased the day since he first reported that story the administration has cut the official number of refugees allowed them to the United states for forty five thousand twenty Nineteen than it was going to be thirty thousand that's great I have to say I think it's I didn't want to play in the pledge drive because I think it is exactly what so many of us turned to public radio for\nOriginal reporting and journalism at uncovers new facts\nFacts that are real facts not fake news generals in the tractor shed new light on what is happening at our country and the world right now that work as expensive to do the episode that that story was part of tickets for months to research put together in a good stories from Mexico Texas Washington in Kansas\nAnd we live in this moment where every fact is contested right where there is a daily battle over what happened in the news that day and what it means if you think it's important for the fact based media to survive if you think it is important for public radio to thrive\nAnd do its job in this environment I just ask you what exactly stops you\nFrom standing up for what you believe in and getting to this radio station that you listen to\nWhat stopped me from supporting this product that you actually are consuming\nThere's had to put you just\nPick up that phone and call one eight hundred six seven eight
