couldn't believe it when you open the window and we read the ... were true Britain we ran into the whole to try to like find other people that are just are like we thought from what I've been playing a trick on us but no one knew what we were talking about no one even remember the thing in Seattle and so I still to this day I don't know\nWhy that [laughter] [noise]\n\nEvery once in a while we get pictures like this at the radio show coincidence stories\nJust they don't really fit in to our usual every week we bring you a theme format we've been sending them aside wondering what to do with them I mean so much to people\nI don't know it felt like it was about or French [laughter] you know it was just it felt you know I I'm not someone that believe in God really but it's a little bit like an act of God or something like just sort of cosmic and larger than us [noise]\nFinally and hit us that we got enough of them we could put them on the radio as their own thing\nSo we put out a call to listeners send us your coincidence stories and you did hundreds and hundreds of you did\nWe rent at least Thirteen hundred coincidence story interviewed dozens of people\nHere just a few things we've learned\nYour most prone to go incidences when you're young teens or twenties lots of coincidences involve your grandmother\nYou're likely to experience a coincidence if you're in or near the Netherlands coincidences also happened to you in or near airplanes or on Craig's list for many of you coincidences where the answer to your prayers are how'd you find you're missing bike also there are coincidences hidden in your name your keys you're close your address we heard stories\nLost roll of film discovered coincidentally in the stomach of a decomposing hyena about the man who got his favorite T shirt back from a stranger's naps act\nIn Slovakia about the woman who is dating not one but two mark Steven Anderson at the same time about the student whose car broke down in rush hour on a busy highway and the one person who just happens to stop it comes to a rescue it's her dad who lives for hours away\nAnd one of my favorites from a woman named Joe Peterson who felt nauseated on the subway in New York City as they pull into the\nSecond Avenue stop there's a garbage can perfectly\nWhile the man's way we're going to sneak these coincidence stories onto their all the stories you'll hear today first aired on our show twenty Thirteen and they're all verified true stories that my colleague hid from me until the actual interview so wouldn't spoil it surprise which is also why there is so much unprofessional giggling this hour\nMy mom and my step dad came to New York to meet with Ellen's pirates and basically over the course of dinner and coffee afterwards we discovered that of basically my father had\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Wish I had had yeah and then suddenly to kind of have him be kind of an active part of my life\nAgain to think that uh I can talk to my mother in law and hear what he was like in his twenties something that my mom doesn't even know\nAnd you know it might actually held his father is a strong believer in the idea that somehow my dad is somehow is behind all this and that somehow you know he's kind of help make all this happened [noise]\n\nAt the time this next story takes place a guy named ... was working in a Chicago suburb called Arlington heights he just started dating a woman named Esther they've been out maybe eight times\nAnd I thought maybe it was time to uh get exclusive or\nBecome boyfriend girlfriend or whatever it was and it was about to go out to lunch and I was thinking about asking you're on a friday date that I had um set up and I went out to lunch and stopped at the store prior to hitting the deli that I normally hit and uh I got some chain went to the deli order my sandwich was\nSix bucks or something like that I pulled out five for my wallet and I pulled out a couple of bucks change that I had gotten from a store handed the clerk one of the ones\nUh and then I looked at it and I I pulled it back\nWritten on the dollar and pencil was I asked her I thought oh that's\nWeird you know I'm thinking about asking her to go study and I get those dollars has asked around bizarre so stuck in my pocket you know charcoal and went to the store I got one of those voting frames and little piece of gold\nWill may and I stopped a dollar and the frame so it was floating in the middle on this piece of gold as if you know you're going to go on a church in Italy and they had a fragment from a robust some saying or something like that and I call it the immaculate dollar of Arlington heights\n[noise]\nSo I'm On the friday I asked her out and she was you know all excited and we're all guilty and then I said hey one more thing\nFor you and I gave her this frame with US dollar in it\nAnd I start ... and he's like it's a dollar with your ... and he's he's on the side of south and I I look at him like freaked out\nShe a ton of fraud or brow a little bit and look concerned and ah I said you know is there a some sort of problem\nI I was speechless for the first time ever but I said you know remind me to tell you something later ... ... ... ... ...\n... okay you know we I I let it go and uh we you know where I had a really should've got engaged we got married a couple of years later we were um unpacking at a new apartment that we had an and I had the they found that\nThe frame with the dollar in it and I stuck it up on the dresser and she came in the room I said hey I'm never told me about this hour what's\nThe deal with that she said well\nWhen I was Nineteen\nYou know I was a cashier working in a a copy shop in downtown Chicago and I was dating someone and I just wasn't happy with him and I just thought you know how do people know who the right person that they're meant to be with\nHow do they how do they know who that is and said you know and I'm not going to worry about that I'm just gonna put my name on the dollar bill\nAnd the guy that gets US dollar bill it's going to be the guy that asks me to marry him\nAnd I'm like well you can't just write them your name I Want actually I think it was more like maybe ten or twelve [noise]\nAnd so does dollar bill that you gave ... I Believe is the\nSame dollar bill that I wrote my name on and I knew that we were going to be married the data you gave me this\nWho the right person that they're meant to be with how do they how do they know who that is I said you know when I'm not going to worry about that I'm just going to put my name on the dollar bill and the guy that gets US dollar bill is going to be the guy that asks me to marry him and I'm like well you can't just write them your name I one actually\nI think it was more like maybe ten or twelve [noise]\nAnd so just dollar bill that you gave me\nI Believe is the same dollar bill that I wrote my name on and I knew that we were\nGoing to be married the data you gave me the dollar bill it was pretty crazy and then you make me sound the story again she asked me like five or six times and I said the details don't change it's the same story like he couldn't I think he was a little bit beside themselves that that actually happened and that I didn't tell [noise]\n\nYou know I I I don't know how I found the will to not say anything to 'em but I just remember like do I don't I Do I don't I Do it you\nKnow what do I do I don't want this guy out and be like why does cause already talking about Mary wait why forget it\nYou know I don't read too much into almost anything [laughter] so I just got to move forward in an after she told me I think\nI went through all the the normal stages of whatever and I just but what does this mean\nFor us are we going to invent a time machine or or kids gonna bring world peace or like well what's the point of some sort of bigger thing that we're not seeing here [noise]\n\nNow just sits in that very same frame up on her dresser and I\nLook at it every day that I wake up sometimes I reminder that we have it one she's upset at me or angry\nIt's never been a question in my mind like you know\nWhat I'm going to get this kind of the curve\nBut but I Do believe it's because of his dollar that I feel that type to them\nI mean obviously I Love him but I think that if it ever did cross my mind I'd be like\nBut we I this is my soul mate I Can't just walk out on him [noise]\nYou know we don't we don't even wear ... and I'm like why\nJust and I'm stuck with you you got the dollar bill\n[laughter] I guess you could also you know put it back out into the register and it'd be like look I'm cash human than [laughter] I think it's got to go to somebody else you could do that\n[noise] Paul\nAnd Esther ... have been married for Nineteen years ago\nYou know [noise] so do you [noise]\n[noise] no [noise]\n\nNo [noise] was it was a [noise]\nThree brother can you spare a dime this story comes from Ryan rows are in Los Angeles\nIt when I was in college um I was actually pledging a fraternity mhm and I ran into some of the like the seniors and I'm On campus and they were laughing about something\nAnd so while I'm tells me the story that had happened on that day supposedly where she gets in the shower and about five ten minutes into a shower\n[noise]\nMy three brothers paradigm the story comes from Ryan rows are in Los Angeles\nIt happened when I was in college um I was actually pledging a fraternity and I ran into some of the like the seniors tend to um on campus and they were laughing about something\nAnd so one of them tells me the story that had happened to him that day supposedly where he gets in the shower and about five ten minutes into a shower\nAnd they quickly run up this kind of small hill is behind this [noise]\nUm and it's all whether there is no houses back there so they wanted to do with this bag\nAnd\nLess than two minutes later they come running back down\nAnd getting the van and they take off so Japanese friends do precisely what you don't want them to do if this were an after school special this is the point where you're yelling at the TV saying don't do it stay inside but they decide\nThey have to find out what the strange men in the band have deposited at the top of the hill so they run up there\nWe get to the top and we kind of look around and then we see that kind of on one side of it there's just this manhole cover like a circular man will cover like you'd see anywhere\nAnd coming from one of the edges of manhole cover it in place is\nUm long brown hair human hair long brown human hair\nThey're teenagers they're stoned their freaked out they have to tell an adult about what they've seen\nA police car happened to Dr died they flag it down and the officer tells him to get in the back\nIt became clear that she was really concerned because she'd been said\nYeah there's been a girl missing on the west side of town for the last couple of days oh my God so down like our hearts just sort of drop\nAnd you had known that hadn't been on the news or something\nLike we had no idea that\nSo we we just kinda got scared at that point\nCan I can I used to have you ever taken is this are you going to get funny or is this a horrifying story we actually don't have any ... okay don't tell me\nI'm so she called another officer and the other officer comes there's a couple cars and they both get out and they tell us to get out and they say okay wait at the bottom [noise]\nSo we're waiting there you go walking up\nAnd it's dark so we can't really\nSee them that well but we can see them well enough and we don't really want to watch what's going on because we see them bend over\nAnd I'm trying not to look but of course I'm working\nPulled up the human figure out of the whole oh my God\nAnd then she says\nIt's a mannequin [laughter] [noise]\nI don't know what my friends with him but I was sitting there thinking own like [noise]\nHow does this story ended up okay you know I've been in any universe you know like [noise]\nUnless you say it's a male [laughter]\nJeff goes to school on Monday tells a story in physics class\nAnd the kid next to him says that was us we did\nWe went around stealing holiday decorations and we had to get rid of them so we stopped them under the manhole cover\nMannequin by the way had been the Virgin Mary in someone's nativity\nScene [noise] I think the real coincidence is that it's like our close friends that\nI'm caused this to happen or they were good friends years yeah\nUnless you say is the man [laughter]\nJust goes to school on Monday tells a story in physics class\nAnd the kid next to him says that was us we did it\nWe went around stealing holiday decorations and we had to get rid of them so we stopped them under the manhole cover mannequin by the way had been the Virgin Mary and someone's nativity scene [noise]\nI think the real coincidence is that it's like our caller from the\nUm caused this to happen or they were good friends here though\nNo Jeff turns out that is not the real ... of the story my producer Brian Reed was listening to all these interviews as they were happening and he interrupted us to tell us we both missed the point is just pointed out that I miss\nYou and I are both [laughter] even though we're in the back of my own story I submitted it to the current events is going\nTo the main coincidences there's a girl missing at the same time you\nFive words for you Dr ... no coincidence no story [noise]\nHere the definition of coincidence that seems right to me a coincidence is a surprising concurrence of events perceived as meaningfully related with no apparent causal connection it's the middle part meaningfully related that people seem to get stuck on because one of ... line up just so\nYou can't help it you can't help but wonder if there's a message in that in that way coincidences are kind of like short cuts to a very big questions about fate about God even people who don't believe in either one the notion that somewhere out there someone or something is paying attention to your life\nThat there might be a plan conjured drew coincidences that notion seems to be most appealing when you're young [noise] the daughter of a jazz guitarist named Andy Riley wrote to us about the time when she was Nineteen she's listening to an Ella Fitzgerald album\nI was listening to the song that old black magic and at the end of the song Ella chosen a line that old black magic that really Daniels got me in and I've heard her you know saying that light on that album dozens of times before and wondered has begun yes\nBut on this particular day for some reason I felt inspired to go out to the the living room and ask my dad to bill Daniels was and he explained that\nIn the forties the bill Daniels had some old like magic in a way that made it his song and he was referred to as Mr Black magic I guess back in the forties and it was a big deal at the time and\nI'd ask my dad had you met him you know did you ever know the Daniels and he said that began you know he's probably dead now and just\nLiterally at that moment the phone rang so I answered the phone and this and playful gravelly voice asked for Andy Riley
