appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it I don't know about you but me I spent a full week obsessively reading\nAbout judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss\nIt and I know this is just\nDaily life and are totally divided country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years where red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions and\nTo me this one feels the worst I think because he originally hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was emotional it was upsetting [noise] and then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief Republican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans\nBut even in moments like this one there are people who haven't picked aside\nAn incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I had to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them\nToday and I shall we have somebody in that situation in our first act Arizona Senator Jeff flake and the second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who is literally deciding on a mass life or death [noise] no\nReal experience or understanding of how to do it [noise] both those people having to make these huge decision\nThey are not comfortable with all [noise] W. easy Chicago it's this American Life America by stay with us [noise]\n\nI find\nJudge to Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turned the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nDrag his decisions down to the wire over and over is undecided didn't seem like it now I'm Kevin up there was a yes that was let's wait a week is Jeff Flake who made the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation then he was a yes again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year\nStay with us [noise]\n\nOne judge for Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the journal on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nDrag his decisions down to the wire over and over used undecided than seem like a no when Kavanaugh was yes it was let's wait a week is if we can made the Senate wait for new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA producers though we choose to spend a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the cabinet of hearing watching when he was going through and talking to him about how we made his choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator here to tell you that's not a true story that's not what changed his mind [noise]\n\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise]\nThat's why my recording isn't as clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just\nStaring at flake peering out from the elevator he just stood me up for an interview\nJust leaks fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune in this case though I think he was miserable\nHe just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the vote and now he was stuff\n[laughter]\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flicking declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination that he was confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake and crumbled\n... was one of the two women and that confrontation play good morning good morning when that elevator door closed with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[noise]\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other one that the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't reading things like\nIt was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history an online site support\nThe heroes who convinced fleet read over thirty thousand dollars and a couple of days lots of people love this version of events\nAnd I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last two weeks has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to say here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks to mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nAnd the women and maybe this morning that they have any last year my also we talked about it wasn't but I Do think there was a\nIt was the thing is just not the thing that convinced him\nProtesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them they're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault\nEverywhere and it's a lot\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham [noise] women jumped on the elevator with that they were being a hero to shirts and\nConvinced him protesters don't affect him like that\nI've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them they're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting

a story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with that they were being a hero to shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake\nEasily found the Portland we support what do you go one way or we believe when we when you think you can replace what do you have to say something you said a winning right now in the survivor clever having this er into that [noise]\nYeah are you going to do the right than ever having a hearing [noise]\nDoes it affect you and people like that [noise] benefits\nOf each of the sleek making fun of himself we've talked about this before like lots of Mendez age she doesn't connect to well to emotion [noise] and he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh I'm\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore he explained might happen next I Want to just say\nGoing into a deal like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day think about it\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not the one time he spoke\nIn the hearing he sounded just as insurer as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process\nBut it's all we've got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this rain today\nAnd uh and just have a little humility on that front so like\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThe night after the four cabinet testimony Thursday night\nFleet stays up all night freaking out over what to do some close friends told them about their own sexual assaults\nHe talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said he found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night\nHe found Kavanaugh credible also\nIn his anger wasn't is off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen them like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision on a boat um it's been it's just a a debates with staff discussions\nLate last night too and it was that was pretty raw you know [noise]\nAh debates with staff discussions late last night too and uh it was that oh it was pretty raw you know [noise]\nWe like politicians we we feed on it [noise] I mean that's a movie admitted not [noise]\nAnd then it happened just like he predicted\nWe like politicians would we feed on it I mean that's a movie admitted [noise]\nAnd then it happened it's just like he predicted\nAfter seven days of being treated as a Democrat or at least a Republican defector fleet comes home to the GOP on Thursday the FBI releases the report that he called for on friday flake announced his decision he's a yes on cap and on I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\nIt looked Jeff and I both went to the same place and read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens a Jeff as a conservative senator he has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't I\nCouldn't stop the FBI report was a disgrace basically they didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as late voted friday he fled the capital I talk to them in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over you were satisfied with the FBI before\nDo you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with the ... you know the Democrats celebrating you'd be you're kind of back among among your people\nAsk people about stuff for several years without a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no file to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family ever [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nVery chase ... program\nI turn out of this recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course as the retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years the him being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today just is a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since he went through it well I like my own\nUh [noise]\nYou know remember the\nSenate is\nA political Bobby and they have to act in the political way\nThe frame or just knew that\nAnd it's really not for me to tell the Senate how to structure that process\nI Do think ah it has the obligation\nOr to recognize the necessity of\nPreserving the neutrality and the independence and and\nThe Senate is\nA political body and they have to act in a political way\nThe frame or just knew that\nAnd it's really not for me to\nTell the Senate how to structure that process\nI Do think ah it has the obligation or to recognize the necessity of\nPreserving the neutrality and the independence and the integrity of our court\n\nYou should ask is whether the judge has the temperament commitment and uh the character and the learning I think the judge should be broadly read\nUm\nI myself was of fascinated with political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge you're going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful\nAbout the [noise]\nSome some southern southern southern slanted a as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience could in high school students people asked embed escape it cases you've always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way he's funny he's a good talker and explain this job how it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us and um\nAnd discuss the case uh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the uh the senior and if the case is one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved\nUm we know that were required to make a decision\nOr the courts have been divided on it and let's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just reverse of our from it's a question that the rationale\nThe principle of\nThe reasons that you'll get and let's say it's five to four the five in the majority\nDon't have a lot of back slapping high fives in thumbs up there there there's there's a moment of all as we realized one of us will have to\nWrite an opinion that commands the allegiance of the American people uh an opinion that explains\nIt teaches the principles of war the principles of the constitution or the control of the result\nAnd when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case uh we draw down on a capital of trust and we make a withdrawal and the trust the public has been our institution and it is our job always to replenish that trust\nA bite hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\n\nOkay well my story I don't know if it's tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how we talk about this\nWas meeting one time with our judges and attorneys in Alabama and I think it was\nThat's the way our court works [noise]\n\n\nOkay well my story I don't know if it's tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talks about this\nI was meeting one time with our judges and attorneys in Alabama and I think it was a Saturday morning and for my schedule or there's are both was at nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few minutes and so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorney raised his hand and said now you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs ah how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and\nDivide them up among the course of course I have to read them all and or if they're very difficult cases I Will take them home and read the briefs the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have opera playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that are one opera cases sometimes to opera cases\n[noise] well the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the oil and they were too polite to roll their eyes but it sounded kind of what intellectually pretentious thirty out here is some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I lost the audience but I Would say because the attorney in the room raised his hand is all I have a rule like that when I write those breeze I said oh it is that I have a one sixth ... sixth back\n[noise]\nI said I think I remember your last one was a three six factory\nThanks to reform club the Palm Beach is recording

P. P. R. [noise] Hi I'm Valerie Smith proud to stand among other public radio supporters\nOn the high plains just American Life from Eric last today's program the unhappy to siders stories of people who are saddled with difficult momentous decisions to make decisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life\nDecisions that way on them like one of our program today was about a judge to is about a jury and we'll just get right to it the story comes to us from the pod cast heavyweight if you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan Gold steam and the premise of the show is that each episode\nI felt guilty you told a reporter and sad\nI don't think I made the right call [noise] Bennett hope that talking about the trial might help and it did\nUp until the article was published that was when ... received and uncomfortable phone call from a lawyer who\nRead the article [noise] spend was at work\nFearing his co workers made over here he took the call outside behind his office building it was there that he learned that eight years earlier he misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions\nI sought incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to\nConvince everyone to choose life imprisonment when in\nFact all I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would have taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote vote\nFend could have cast so they would have been no miss trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison without parole [noise]\nThat would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed [noise] like who let them live [noise]\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness she addressed given me and if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness that felt so weird like it it wasn't something I completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Maryland back\nI did begin to apply but I didn't I\nDidn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and it just you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like I really recommend a\n\nFew months after ... have Marilyn the mail and execution date which at the state would put post story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something\nUnexpected happened Glenn injured at the cherry the parents who the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied to cherries in spite of their sons\nSo much pain in there and [noise] I feel like a really read things are\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date which at the state would put post story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected\nHappened Glen and Judith cherry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically due to the cherry presents a statement which reads in part we do not want\nPaul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds\nBased on this testimony with only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he didn't it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nFor not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my good for not drawing [noise]\nShame leads to nurture and it's even the most casual reader or the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain a nerd until it has acted upon by an external force\nIn other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would read and I hope I'm not being too\nForward ask Marilyn as she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger about a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes I have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email\nAddress as well as my phone number with no reply Joseph forwards originally emailed us then once you send two years ago when he can't stop thinking about\nWhen I read it I'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son or tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark\nI understand that span consumed by guilt\nWould read so much into so little but what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place [noise]\n\nDidn't recognize that's my job I mean I\nLike I have a couple of little thing if you're if you get packages at all or some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK\nMarilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas

reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and wearing endlessly about a safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member was our policy is the cause of all of this and that was a very hard for me it's like they wanted everything to be okay but that's my chow and I love him and I'm not gonna ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him meant working with her son's lawyers to changes sentenced to life in prison\nPiles appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality job
