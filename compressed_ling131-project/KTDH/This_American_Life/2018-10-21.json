it almost feels wrong to tell it in a room\nThis grand\nIt's actually about a real opera singer\nNot a super famous upper singer or anything like that person go free makes about half of our living singing the other half she makes a recording audio books\nAnd about a year ago she was staying at a hotel and she had a deadline on his children's book that she was supposed to be recording and hotel room was kind of noise is using a lot of noise from the street and digital driver quiet places you went into the causes put pillows all around to dead and the sound\nSound on the floor with microphone and then the court at the microphone or went under the door\nOf the closet out to her laptop because her laptop had affairs made noise that just because of the door so it's pitch dark except for the

research is locked them [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] oh my God [noise]\nThe guy told me at first she thought like this isn't going to be that hard right after all she has the pet is why she could call the front desk on Skype right and it was a problem\nThis life I was like half of one bar and it kept\nJust cutting out but I found the hotel number that's courses on the recording into six

side and Eighteen minutes after car logs herself in she hears people she hears some German tourists\nWalking towards her down the hall unfortunately\nShe actually has the skills for this very situation [noise]\n\nGermans come to the door of the room they whisper to each other for\nA little bit and then they do nothing [noise]\n[laughter] [laughter]\nOr husband is I don't know ... he's also

remember is she's just an opera singer right an opera is all about the spectacle you know eighty people on the stage and horses and of vengeance\nAnd be grand feeling it was really it would really be hard to get further from that\nTo what happened to her in that closet right all the action takes place in space not much bigger than your body it is the symbolism\nImaginable there's literally\nTo what happened to her in that closet right all the action takes place in his speech not much bigger than your body it is this the boys pot imaginable there's literally no movement in the spot if
