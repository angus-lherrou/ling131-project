you but ... there's been a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watch videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me all the moments we've had these last few years were red\nAmerica America will be the\n\n\nHaving a\nLot you\nYeah\nI like the phone\nYeah um\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nNo real experience or understanding of how to do it but I Want to tell you I grew up against people knew how to make these huge decision came only not comfortable\n\nTo Senator Jim Webb is one of the central layers are drawn on Capitol Hill\nLast week from TV and you just tortured face\nDrag his decisions down to the wire over and over he was undecided didn't seem like a new one cabin up there was a yes that was let's wait a week is way committed the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation then he was a guess again\nProducers do we change has been a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill Jews were them in the days before and after the cabinet like urine watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is there's always\nFirst thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story a jet Li changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator near and tell you that's not a true story\nPeter okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator near and tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind [noise]\n\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise]\nThat's why my recording isn't as clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator just admit for an interview just late fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a\nStatement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat and now he was stuff\n[noise]\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination than English confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake crumbled\nArchie and I was one of the two women and that confrontation play good morning good morning when that elevator door closed with Senator Flake did you think that history might change [noise]\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other one that the elevator they always hedge how influential they were the lots of others don't reading things like\nIt was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history an on line said support the heroes who\nConvinced fleet reads over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days lots of people loved his version of events\nAnd I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last two weeks has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nEnded the women and maybe this morning that they have any throw your mind also we talked about it was ... it was it\nWas the thing is not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere and it's a lot\nJust the day before Lincoln I'd gotten an elevator and the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham women's jumped on the elevator with us they were being a hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out do you believe women Senator Flake\nEasily to Portland we support what are you know we live in one way and therefore we believe women have when you\nThink you can't replace what do you have to say something you didn't say the winning right now in the survivor\nGlad we're having this er into this yeah are you going to do the right to whatever happened to her and [noise]\nIt affects you and people like that [noise] benefits\nOf each of the ... making fun of himself we talked about this before with lots of men his age she doesn't connect you well to emotion [noise] and he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh I'm\nConnect to well to emotion [noise]\nAnd he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh I'm\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now I don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day think about it\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not the one time he spoke\nIn the hearing he sounded just as insurer as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's always got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize that it is we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India and there is likely to be as much doubt as certain to\nGo out of this room today and uh and just have a little humility on that front so like\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThe night after the four cabinet testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do some close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said he found Ford credible and convincing\nBut he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't is off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen them like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision on a vote 'em that's been it's just\nA debates with staff discussions late last night too and uh it was that was pretty raw you know [noise]\nMm Mm next morning of course like finally releases the statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in it and you've got to come back to\nYou know for some sort of innocence\nYou go to the elevator get yelled at on TV than to the committee meeting you know that part [noise] meanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and he gets the news that freaks yes he chokes up reportedly\nIt looked Jeff and I both went to the same place and read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens a Jeff as a conservative senator he has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't\nWho started the FBI report was a disgrace basically they didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as late voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes you said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied that the FBI before\nDo you feel better now you're kind of back among people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you you're kind of back among among your people\nAsk people about stuff man chocolate chip are only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no file to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family ever [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nChase when the students have a program\nThat turn out of this a recording that we found that Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is the retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years the him being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nYou stand here today justice of potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the\nYou in a back in twenty ten I stand here today jak potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has that changed since he went really well I like my own\nUh [noise]\nUh you know remember the\nSenate is\nA political body and they have to act in a political away\nThe frame or a new ad\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nI Do think ah it has the obligation or to recognize the necessity of\nPreserving the neutrality and the independence and the integrity of our court\n[noise]\nYou should ask is whether the judge has the temperament the commitment or the character and the learning I think the judge should be broadly read\nUm I my\nSelf was of fascinated with political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about the [noise]\nSome southern southern southern southern Senate or as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience getting high school students people asking bed a staple cases they'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court you know by the way he's funny he's a good talker and explain this job how it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us and um and discuss the case\nUh we begin when or if you've seen you've already for the most senior judge or to the least senior and if the case is the one in which there is a great issue with the public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision\nOr the courts have been divided on it and let's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just reverse of our from it's a question that the rationale\nThe principle of the reasons that you'll get and let's say it's\nFive to four the five in the majority\nDon't have a lot of back slaps on high fives in thumbs up\nThere there there's there's a moment of all as\nWe realize one of us will have to write\nAn opinion that commands the allegiance of the American people uh an opinion that explains\nThe teach the principles of war the principles of the constitution or that that control the result\nAnd when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case we draw down on a capital of trust we make a withdrawal on the trust that the public has been our institution and it is our job always to replenish that trust\nA bite hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\n\nOkay well my story I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talks about this\nI was meeting one time with our judges and attorneys in Alabama and I think it was a Saturday morning and for my schedule or there's we're both was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few minutes and so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorney raised his hand and said now you have all that tremendous amount of leading to do all of those briefs or how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and\nDivide them up among the course of course I have to read them all and if they're very difficult cases I Will take them home and read the brief the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have a separate playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that are one opera cases sometimes to ...\n[noise] well the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the odd that they were too polite to roll their eyes but it sounded kind of what intellectually pretentious thirty I here's some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I lost the audience but I was safe because the attorney in the room raised his hand is all I have a rule like that when I write those breeze I said oh it is that I have a one sixth ... sixth back\n[noise]\nI said I think I remember your last one it was a three six pack\nThanks to reform club the Palm Beach is

Berger\nAbout a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes\nI have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply shelter forwards her original emails and then once you send two years ago when he can't stop thinking about\nI read it I'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even ...\nThe one he can't stop thinking about\nWhat I read it some expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks very much for the article and says she shared it with her son cartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark\nI understand that's been consumed by guilt\nWould read so much into so little but would I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place [laughter]\nMm [noise]\n[noise]\nCommitted recognizes joking I have\nLike I have a couple of little thing if you're if you get back to ... some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK Marilyn\nLives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meet in a hotel suite\nDowntown where I Can't stop offering a food that she can stop refusing\nYou want to have a coffee or tea know Maryland\nIs a child in stately with smiling eyes she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black she sits on the end of the couch next to it in the armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always life of the party I mean I was a jokester all makes you you have Marilyn there 'cause she's going to keep the policy going I was always kind of wanted everybody went to people know you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person everyday she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and worrying endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and under the mobile and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member was our policy is the cause of all of this and that was a very hard for them it's like they wanted everything to be okay but that's my chow and I love him and I'm not going to ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him when working with her son's lawyers to change your sentence to life in prison\nPiles appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became extremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it cost me my job\nAfter losing her job Maryland then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son so it's kind of\nLike you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over so that's a hard thing\nMm I'm\nIn I'm\nTen years after the trial and everyone or friends or family have all moved on to win Maryland rent spends\nArticle she signed him someone like her and someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay descendants the death penalty I thought I had that I I thought I had literally died it didn't even register because I'm just like what just happened what have they done\nKnow my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read okay what are they thinking what are they doing 'em I wanted them to know if I can only tell\nTry to read okay what are they thinking what are they doing 'em I wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of\nPerson he has and I want people to know you know ever dies they assume that if you involved in a heinous crime like that the truth monster but he wants a monster [noise]\nYou know OK so she is going to come up in Maryland and I have been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk for us I think that probably is then\nThey sit in at the end it's been a fan\n[laughter] I Hope I get there before he gets it [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice arts fans span this at the door [noise]\nI understand I've drawn in his ... year now how do you\nSpend your ... okay I get a lot of girls vent lingers in the door the hotel room and a half feet over there uh he's been spectacle\nNeatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks around and clears his throat\nUm [noise] a little nervous [noise] and so there were\nThere with a lifetime Maryland in ... and then in the same room was ten years ago at the trial Maryland was seated behind the bar expense and the jury box but today he sits down in the empty armchair beside or you can't quite bring himself to look at her as he tells Maryland what it was like to receive or email you gaze is down in his lab\n[noise] it was very surprising and um [noise] I read and re read it and I even began\nTo her letters or never went anywhere I ... I don't know what to say what did you say about that\nI don't want to write a letter that's trying to make me feel better you know what I mean", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "07"}
