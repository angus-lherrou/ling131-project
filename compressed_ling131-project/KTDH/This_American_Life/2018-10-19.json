P. P. R. dot org\nYou're listening to high plains public radio on line right now is made possible in part by the financial support of the community sponsors you hear mentioned on the air please finding occasion to thank them for their support\nIt school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into their building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training they were running the first real in the school building with a gun French and the boxes\n[noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around\nIt's a district in rural Ohio there's that his record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe day people on this team only to teachers all do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team dishes pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this work exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school [noise]\nI saw the ride a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter is as soon as possible and they time each drill okay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nThat he fired during these drills so the first little glitch\nThey came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the sea\nSo you have to put your finger on the sensor is like a fingerprint than\nAnd for taking my\n\n[noise] [noise]\nThere's a sheriff's deputy he's playing the issue [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's a principal for grade six to twelve he's running from his office\nStarts by the cafeteria [noise]\nHe's got a gun he's rambling proof that he's holding a walkie talkie\nVery focused area where the clock is ticking he told me that every the second one of these shootings and other to kill not enough of this way [noise]\n\nElementary awareness and they all ... [noise]\n[noise] I'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway\nAnd it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically when the focus into lockdown\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nYeah ... he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n\nAll right here we go [noise] and we go [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there\n[noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nDoor opens there on the elementary school aside and they find the shooter right there [noise] so\nThat's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything it just timing or side\nWasn't great that wasn't the attorney compare to the first yeah oh yeah it was it was the area the doors [noise]\n\nThey said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to\nThem I I talked to John the principal about that yeah I'm for a long time she agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy\nDidn't grow up with guns had never used one they came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force ... so if a shooter gotten the building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you worry because you realize that you're on your own and and\nSo I wanted to learn [noise]\nAnd so I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary it was scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around\nHow close do you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target you've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss because if I miss\nThere's a possibility somebody else getting hurt [noise] All right and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't let it\nBe me who hurts a student in my school of course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise] I I wouldn't have believed but these things don't stop happening they just continue to happen\nIn\nThese shootings do just continue to happen today and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare for like the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it looks at past to dissipate the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help\nWB easy Chicago it's this American Life America last stay with us [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nEdwin ... will never be pretty school just trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for gunmen there's an exam\n[noise]\nLike one ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for a gunman there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training but I don't think they could have been more\nPrepared than work day and I mean they knew what to do we knew what to do\nEven still even with that and we still had\nCats are these people that are going to return to their families\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what about producers Robin semi went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane mornings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is at school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher and that news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class\nWe know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ... for every period for every ... this is what a code black and this is what we do it for two days for\nTwo days we went over the procedures with the kid\nWas you have to do it with each and every class\nBecause they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they need so if they were apps not silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise] was it says her kids to the drill seriously on a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten the school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in their classroom doors of paper\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshman building flicking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's\nThey they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that\nIs not what the drill was you know it was real [noise] [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um and I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gun shot sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction wow\nTo give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in yes\nIt was [laughter] yes it was laughing\nThere were terrified people reading and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that I\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol or follow your and thanked me for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nHer classroom lifted that are attendant sheet out of her emergency folder you kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway group it small enough to fitness applied closet someone told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and move\nDifferent class she pulled in from the hallway the group it small enough to fit and it's applied call that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and move there in the closet it was hot and dark except students faces live by their cell phones Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um\nMy friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there's a shooter in my floor um and so my ... my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my window is blown out and then she told us she had been grazed by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet thank God and I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our went by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um has it has a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the cause it without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not because you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police have said this is a police anyone in here and then there was I kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is the police's anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure\nI'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops and so I just\nVery slowly ... than you pulled on the handle pushed it up and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] what's it told me that actually was one of five people she knew who had broken political that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to be\nAn even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong\nAnd my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yelled to you know not being able to close the door and grabs\nThe handle with two hands and pulls it closed 'em for her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nThey see it's the teacher who are most grazed she survived got Beagle in the room next to Stacy used at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in his doorway\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a playbook\nFor what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I Move us all to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually have save lives and mass shootings I really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nThey have save lives and mass shootings I really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive because of it what might have worked better\nCheryl Johnson researches what effective in these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas\nLike paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also code ran all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said no to this too\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes\nAnd all I I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go ... shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there is a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked redound in yet\nBut the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultant I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways responds was shooting sometimes you Daniel room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you cite basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nI told her about actually occurs how she'd stood in the doorway grabbing of dozens of scared student [noise] I'm a rose a break from her school's protocol\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling in kids the problem with\nThis and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gun me being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of their training at Douglas was barricaded on your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against her classroom door but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away it would have been way harder to pull the kids into her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would have made it and\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for something concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school squatting hide\nBut when I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one classroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how it investigator on that case told me that Israel did not help them at all\nThat have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills in school period\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know every\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nI wanted to know about barricaded\nAnd I want her to know about renting in fighting back\nI Want her to know that active shooters because it's a thing to reckon with\nAll want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nHis name is Tom present ski he graduated last year there across the set up for three people he knew well one of them was a teacher named ms Perkins so he really loved he said she always try to be strict with him the can never keep coming up front for very long\nJust breeze taken nice to press he can nice the rats OK okay breathe with me [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAfter a few minutes he's cut his breath enough to talk he tell Sandy he wants to shootings to stop so he wants to take action somehow and then tried suddenly switches gears and start selling out his feelings about guns\nHe wants to shooting stops he wants to take action somehow and then tried suddenly switches gears and start filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nNoses before I was going on on the road [noise] taking drugs is not going to change that because the strip orange or drugs or if you're still able to do and\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turns Twenty one later this year to build says are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in the second amendment\nBut they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks a person can buy however Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support\nBut it's impossible for grieving parents\nTo avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement of conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government staged mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are vague he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face at a gun control and then he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and done it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of him it looked like a shoving match was about to start until Sandy stepped in broke it up I reached out to Jones through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNotice truth ... trolls families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after the\nFill up the son gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail the hope through their one of the things that Philips and foreign parents about they tell families to brace themselves\nOh Mm Mm Mm Mm\nAfter watching Lonnie and fanny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse friend called Sandy from the theater the minute\nI picked up the phone there was [noise]\n[noise] screaming just [noise]\nHorrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting and I was like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in and open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was slowed it was so horrific and something I've never heard before\nI tried and that's what I woke up because the screen was so loud it was so horrific and something I never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their couch re holder\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people were injured\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nSandy Hook were twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the thoughts as\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy said they didn't even have to think about it they need at least said yes because they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they felt\nNervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what we looked like five months ago that looked like um they're hanging on to each other um they've been trying to show their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like their bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the Philips has said there was also a strong an instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from\nWell they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson the parents had lots of kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe to fill up to now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moments that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in a mass shooting\nThe only experts are the people it's happened to\nTo help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief plus a bunch of other practical things\nEverything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids photos to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what they want you to get back to normal my own\nBrother should they should you not the same as you were shouldn't you know let me explain something you're right I'm not the same person I never will be they should as we're obsessed with this well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief number fades old relationship start to fall away people who were closest to disappear which makes its informal support groups even more crucial [noise]\n[noise] what's that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see\nThat when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting at Parkland\nMonica in that store at and let them at their house there's something with Nick he was the captain of Parkland swim team was about to go to the University in Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid who collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops\nMitt said they'd just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared\nCollected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops but said they'd just reached a point where they're becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together\nThe day of the shooting mission aka got phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nick was okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting\nAnother set of police officer with giving him a ride home and then a nurse at a local hospital that you thought patient who match next description but by that he leaves the door at still hadn't are directly from neck they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area it's out in the ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery telephone rang he jumped and think is Nick calling from somebody else's phone um media was calling you do you have any comments can we help you find your son and I should say [noise]\nYeah and I'm\nAt two o'clock in the morning you see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the years like strange from these rooms\nThen their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like the we couldn't even find your son and you know and I hope that he was somewhere else and I'm taking keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like this and take that long to our house\nAnd then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital it'll\nJust like a nightmare second ...\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a good wanted to look at it
