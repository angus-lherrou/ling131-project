S. three thirty and that's that's the guitar hanging in my in my case uh in in my living room so\nThat was my first success in integrating music into my work actually writing it into one of my books I grew up in Chicago I was ah I was a suburban kid and\nMusic was all all I always had an attraction to it I Would always play around with writing my own songs from from the time I was you know maybe nine or ten years old and when I was Thirteen\nI found the guitar a friend of mine taught me how to play and man I played it all through high school\nThat that's how I Survived high school I I Would cut off my classes and sit in the music department and and play guitar that that's where I found my creative voice for the first time\nWho were you listening to back in Chicago in those days\nThe musician that inspired me\nTo start singing I started playing guitar first\nAnd we just jammed my friend who taught me how to play which is jammed jam a gym but then I heard this one album by this one singer songwriter and I thought\nI Want I Love those songs and they're easy to play and I want to I Want to play them I Want to sing those songs and that was John Prine\nAnd it was a specifically his sweet revenge loan\n[noise] without\nThere was something about the combination of simplicity and and profound\nProfoundly great writing that I was able to connect to to the point where I I could actually play it myself emulate in myself and it was before I really started writing anything myself but it is really what what hooked me in\nAnd you gave up for a while giving up as a wrong word I don't think I'd ever left you but he put it aside yeah giving up is the right word oh okay yeah it's the right word because what happened was you know that was I started playing high school and I played all through\nCollege and I I wrote my first really good songs in college so I was that I still play today songs that I recently recorded and I that's what I was going to do and then in Nineteen eighty one two things happened I graduated college and I got married\nAnd it suddenly occurred to me that person\nAnd then in Nineteen eighty one two things happened I graduated college and I got married\nAnd it suddenly occurred to me that pursuing a music career and I'm I'm feeding people were mutually exclusive ideas because I married into my daughter so I was I was twenty three years old I was ... I was a father like overnight\nAnd and had great responsibility along with that so I I I gave up the music\nAnd it was so painful\nWas the right thing to do I don't regret it was the right thing to do\nAt that time in those circumstances\nBut it was so painful that I I had to give it up completely it was like the like the gunslinger hang up his gun I put the guitar away and I didn't play\nFor it seems like he ons but it was it was probably just a couple of years but it seemed like forever because was putting aside such a huge part of myself and that's when I went into business in order to ah\nTo feed the family\nSo took up a business life for a while or if you would um what kind of business where are you in ... when when did you learn from it at first\nThe only reason that I went into business was to support my family I had no idea what business was\nAmiss a place that you went to make a paycheck I I didn't know anything about business I had a friend who gave me a gave me a job working in in the commodities futures industry\nWhich is a very speculative\nPart of the financial services world and if you're not familiar with with commodities and put it this way investing commodities is sort of like investing in the stock market except it's risky I got into that business because I had a I was given an opportunity to do it and I thought that's where I also found that I was an entrepreneur\nAnd within a couple of years two or three years I actually ended up with my own shop so I started working for somebody else and pretty soon I had my own small commodities from\nAnd that's where I learned how to do everything from hiring to marketing to client relationship and all that sort of thing so from the outside looking in\nIt was the American dream kind of a thing this is all before I was Thirty Years' old right and but this time I had two kids and and a third on the way and I was my own boss my own company doing my thing but there was one\nSmall tiny little problem\nStaring at the screen\nUntil blood breaks out on your forehead [laughter] and that was that was you know that was my experience for a year and a half but it but\nOnce it was done and we started shopping around it got it was sold within twenty four hours wow yeah so that was published in two thousand and four and so it is accomplished a couple of things it was a creative process for me it it gave me a bigger platform to teach this important message of of love and business\nAnd that and then I've written to more sense and another one on the way ...\n...

R. G. [noise]\n\nI'll come back to all the songs as John Dylan was if it does but we're talking with leadership guru and musicians Steve Farber\nNow music came back to you sometime during this time yes how that happened I keep thinking that there there was an opening there was a crack raid the music got in to paraphrase on\nA daily ... influence to all our lives that otherwise known as Leonard Cohen at a at\nA crack happened and music came back\nYeah a series of cracks gradually and organically over the years I started playing music again\nI just started playing again every so often I pick up the guitar but let me tell you a story if I may ... years back in Nineteen eighty one when I got married and I gave up music I had at the time a guitar my first\nReally good guitar that I had bought in Nineteen Seventy six or seven seven it was a gory and do you are I Am a Michael ... is still around who doesn't make guitars anymore but but back then\n... was was kind of getting some fame and and ah and I bought one of one of his guitars and I'd I'd love guitar and I played it all through college and I wrote my first good songs on that guitar and then I'm\nIn Nineteen eighty one maybe Nineteen eighty two I needed money so I sold\nA very common story among musicians starving musicians I sold it to a woman named Leslie for two hundred and eighty dollars and and I I remember vividly\nWatching Leslie walk down the hall from my apartment with my guitar and it was like watching the death of a dream\nAnd that was that was the beginning of the end of music\nAnd they're like I said over the years you know once I got into business found my path and all the the things that I've told you about I started playing music again and and I started to collect guitars I bought a really nice a\nNice Martin the forty five and and uh and I got that Gibson you know at that I mentioned earlier and\nBut I always had this kind of hole in my heart about that green [noise] it was just you know it's one of those things that you know so many musicians have had that experience right a lot of people listening to this have had a similar experience then one day about six years ago maybe seven years ago now out of nowhere I got an email\nFrom a woman named Leslie\nAnd it was this long email about how she had\nMy name on our Web and are or where I was speaking or something like that then she went to my website and and so when I was doing so she felt inspired to write to me she said oh I'm so you know I this is Lesley and I'm I'm living in Texas and my kids are grown and I heard your name and women are and I'm\nAnd and I'm doing this and I'm the kind of catching me up on things and and as you say that and and I still have that Dorian you sold me all this\nWomen are and on and and I'm doing this and I'm the kind of catching me up on things and and as you say that and and I still have that Dorian you sold me all those years ago\nAnd she must have said something else in the email but after I read that I didn't see anything else I I was I couldn't breathe and my my heart was beating and I and I collected myself and I [noise] I took a breath and I wrote her back\nIf I have a love for the people that that I work with if I have a love for the clients that I serve if\nI Love the business that I'm In the work that I Do if I loved the future that we can create together if I loved the values that we stand for then I'm going to bring all of that to bear on my work and the way I Do it and the effect that I have on people\nDo what you love and the service of people who love what you do is the extreme leaders credo ... so I'm doing what I Love that's important but I'm using that love to serve you\nWherever you are customers clients colleagues family friends whatever do what you love in the service of people\nBut I'm using that love to serve you\nWhoever you are customers clients colleagues family friends whatever do what you love in the service of people and the serve them to such a degree and they have such an impact on them that they're the result is they love me back do you love and the service of people who love what you do so yes I guess you could say that's a\nCapital L it's not it's not about giving lip service to it I mean how many times have you seen companies say your print the ban has been saying we love our customers maybe even a button that they were on the lapel\nCarry that you know [laughter] and they say the words are really easy to say right so it's not about\nWalking around the halls have your company and every so often you stop the action at a big group hug in the hallway and everybody's smiles all the time and nobody ever argues and\nI mean that sounds nauseating to me frankly a an environment that's really characterized by love in the culture\nTends to be livelier there tends to be more debate there tends to be more of conflict coming from the right place because people have very high standards so real love creates very high standards and we hold each other and ourselves accountable the meeting those standards\nBut not because we're trying to we're trying to control people are not because we're trying to trying to um uh make life miserable because I'm the boss just the opposite we're doing it because we love the place\nAnd we're not going to tolerate substandard behavior if you don't want to get out it's very simple so um [noise] it has implications everywhere now where does where does music for them to this for me I mean I don't know that there's a universal principle there but for me\nLove of music and my willingness first of all my willingness to and then and then actually doing the music performing\nMusic recording music has a very profound impact on my energy level in my work when you stop and think about it should be obvious we are the same person at home and in business now we might play different\nRoles but we're the same person it's inarguable it's the truth we're literally the same person same DNA same internal organs same memory same experience\nSo obviously my experience in one neighborhood\nIs going to affect my experience in the other you cannot separate the two that's just some something that we tried to do and it just doesn't work we should never tried it but so if if music is my passion and I and I pursue that it's going to carry over into my work love is love\nAnd it's you know it it it it's just it's a way to for me it's a way to inspire myself but also for me\nBecause of the kind of work that I Do I have a good amount of creative license I've actually started literally bringing music into my work\nYes and you recently held a conference where the whole group of people wrote a song yes tell us about how the\nWork yeah so the first thing I started doing was ah was and this was this was really a a ... it ... it was very scary at first and still is kind of scary and the good the good kind of scary\nWhere I Would actually um bring my guitar along with some of my business keynote speech and play a song that I wrote\nFor the business audience and it's really had had a lovely effect on people it's not gratuitous everything that I Do in a business contacts particularly when I'm speaking has to have\nA lesson to it it it can't be like here's leadership and here's how are you\nIt's particularly when I'm speaking has to have a lesson to it it it can't be like\nHere's leadership and here's how you apply love is a business person and look what do I can play guitar too that cool and then is that the [laughter] that doesn't work [laughter] so the music has to have\nA a message to it and the message is I gave up music\nYou audience gave up something somewhere along the line there was something that you were passionate about something that you loved that you gave up most people you gave up because well for any number of reasons you thought it was frivolous you couldn't make money at at the end of feel like a waste of time even though you loved it is that's how you justified\nAnd just gave it up so the messages if that is true\nFor you you need to bring that back and the reason is is this is in the context of leadership discussion because you owe it to the people that you're leading to bring that back for yourself because that's where you get your energy\nFrom and they're going to feel that so in January we we had um we did a conference called the extreme leadership experience\nWhere I I invited people kind of in in my community we had about a hundred people that were there that that are practitioners of the radical leap\nLove energy audacity of proof they read my books and they apply what they've been learning and they've had great success in their companies in their businesses or the business people and we had a series of like Ted style talks with people got up and gave a little case studies about how they apply this stuff\nBut then have my conference I put it together I did the curriculum so music was damn well going to be a part of this [laughter] so\nAt the end of day one I invited my friend Jay Jay French\nWho is the er the founder of and guitarist for and manager of twisted sister and he talked about his experience in in in the music business you know from a leadership and entrepreneur the perspective and on day two brought the music full on so Sandra Joseph\nWho was the longest running Christine and found some of the opera on Broadway\nShe came and told her story and saying some songs in the context of her ... Ninety minute keynote and and people were they were blown away I mean people were looking at me literally turning around in their chairs\nEt cetera was doing her thing looking at me and saying\nWhat the hell is going on here and they couldn't believe that this was happening\nWas that was that amazing and then after lunch\nUm and people were saying to me ah what the hell are you going to do after Sandra Joseph man I mean where do you go from there so after I sing yeah just wait wait cat that got discovered so after launch I I I brought up a my dear friends or the brothers Corinne ... and\nThese guys I just need to step back for a second\nBecause they represent at\nBack to your question another major crack or the light went through I met ... at a conference that we're both attending and both presenting it and\nThey heard me play a song I heard them do their thing and it was like an instant broom ants to use the horrible cliche we played music till three o'clock in the morning the first time we met just sat around jamming now for me that was so significant\nBecause these guys are world class I mean world class musicians and songwriters and you know singer songwriters they played a ...\nOur world class I mean world class musicians and songwriters and you know singer songwriters they've played arena shows they they've toured with pink and Coldplay and rod Stewart them I mean these guys are\nThe real deal and they and they were so encouraging to me\nHave played them a couple of my original songs and they were like blown away by the songs and I could tell was genuine they weren't just saying oh great song man\nIt was like well what do you what are you doing with those songs that was the question what are you doing this one I just did it [laughter] that's what I'm doing it I play it every so often\nAnd they encouraged me\nTo really reignite the songwriter part of myself\nAnd that's what ended up and going in the studio together and producing the album there's not a dream I wouldn't keep there were so instrumental in that for me and store I mean I I Love those guys so much not only for who they are but for what they re ignited in myself\nI just wanted to touch on something that's coming up really really strongly for me which is the the accountability to risk\nYou talked about risk with commodities yeah and yet there's this accountability to risk sitting with them to risk stepping into the studio to risk bringing music into a venue that doesn't usually have music except at the after party [noise]\nYes this is a big risky thing yes you're doing [laughter] funny you should say that it's almost as if there is an draw that you have a mandate in a way that you have this accountability to taking risks [noise]\nYes I Do have a mandate and a self accountability\nFor taking risks and it's also is one of the things that I've learned in in my leadership endeavors and it's also as it turns out one of the principles that I teach so love", "show_name": "Art Of The Song", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "21"}
