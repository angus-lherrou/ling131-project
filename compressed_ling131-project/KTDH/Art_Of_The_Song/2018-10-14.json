Charles and Isaac Korean otherwise known as the brothers Korean formulate the king ... and we're thrilled to be talking with you about all things some writing process and anxious to know where you came from and how this all got started well thank you born in\nAdelaide, Australia or to hit the parents I Would say on our mother is um a beach e Adelaide a singer was in the original hair cost of ... and our father is is a businessman who found an Indian ... and so we were you asked Rand babies really\nAnd I brought up in in beautiful sunny Adelaide beaches in churches and then eleven we moved to Sydney\nAnd that our father is a seasonal a hippie are really rowing a rowing club ... along grandma um [noise] well to do family but left\nIn Greece hair out and I met the real deal in our mother who he loved because he had a wild mom himself that he says I a a rowing boy meets hippie combination [laughter] we come from that [laughter]\nYou know which fork to you that dinner [laughter] when we started getting a little little manners and free wild heart you know what you're just nailed it\nThank you for saying that 'cause there's something about sitting at the table without father if you're not sitting with two cheeks in the chair facing with the drink holding the context then he knows it and he's like why you distracted it's all about what you said [laughter] and we love him for it\nAnd music and clearly came from him from musical lineage when did it come together for the two of you became to music\nVery differently we first\nFormed together as we were writing a song for our fathers second wedding I mean we didn't know what to get them so we thought we'd harmonize for him and and uh so that was wonderful and with that was the first time that we have heard the effect of comedies are rather harmonies kind of create this the town\nCard was studying jazz he came to music earlier at eleven studied jazz guitar and I thought I was going to be a lawyer\nBut I'm strangely enough when I was Fifteen I I had a a deep voice said simply you sing and I didn't believe it on our lives in the room [noise]\nAnd ah I didn't pay no attention but then six months later I was at a policy in Sydney as high school potty and I had a friend named you a native and he was playing like a Jimi Hendrix kind of vibe and he looked at me with a crazy on he said seeing ... back\nAnd just being simply invited in to kind of debt I'd never song really before or at least been aware of singing and so I started wailing the blues and potty gathered round and he said and I could sing I caught his eye\nThat's that's it you're singing for our band and two weeks later I was singing to two hundred and fifty kids and I was hooked so that's how I came to and then we we met up an informed down musical partnership in New York City\nAnd it was it was as if um I was the first to file a mother who who\nAfter divorcing father's to surprisingly about two years after that was continued to surprises and it was like I'm moving to New York city um and uh she moved out I was the first to follow of three kids and um I had a really strong\nGut feeling about it a new is missing her and and they'd been like mother a position to heal and yet there was another layer of it underneath sat 'em which that Seventy seven this year I got to acknowledge for about a year ago I was like thank you for making the pathway at the time\nThere's another layer of it underneath the uh which that thirty seven this year I got to acknowledge her about a year ago I was like thank you for making the ... at the time was devastating at our visited her in New York and I felt this feeling like okay no there's something if I may\nAnd so I said what if I stayed and went to high school yeah sorry or dish in for performing arts high school and to study jazz at sixteen moved to New York and was never left the same and like I said he came ever finished school up in Boston and then we we joined in New York City and we saw first how many\nAre ever and we just knew we could not do it it wasn't even a should we do this it was it how do we not did this and I'm\nA first musical journey in this country was we uh we bought cheap backpacks I took a little classical guitar\nAnd we went to X. friend's house in Boston and then we went up to New Hampshire and for New Hampshire to Miami over the course of about seven weeks we hitchhiked and greyhound Boston and ...\nNo two thousand and and you just stayed all night in pox\nShot you two thousand a time when no one would do that I'm imagining we we learned the hard way that no one really wanted to pick us up to lanky Australian guys with backpacks and the guitar that it was the best of our work together in the world I'm not always the best for the first real music\nMan na\nWoman serving\nTree and\nWhat we didn't have yet rather than the magic was occurring in a lot of ways as much as we acknowledged and look grateful for the magic that was occurring like we did it you know weekly residency in New York that wet honestly a couple of hundred friends would come every week friends don't just fans\nBut friends of each other because of the music and um it was it became a place to be and and we've just created this well for that I'm an old the other things all the people who have had an effect on all the different songs that have made their way to different places in the world in touch people different ways [noise] um\nWe were still looking ahead going yeah but how do we [laughter]\nAnd uh that was a big listen to him [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThis is John dealing with the ... you're listening to the song a virtual coffeehouse for seniors songwriters creative explorers and fans we're talking with the brothers Coren\nLet's talk a little bit about this transitioning and morphing you came to LA to really deep in your understanding of the the great mystery that is songwriting\nUm and that you are now sharing that and facilitating that with others from all walks of life and I think that's fascinating\nBecause music is running in the background of everyone's life everywhere you go up and we forget that somebody made that music and because it's just running all the time one of the reasons that we started our son was like\nWhy don't you like to know who wrote that and why ... because it informing you\nAll the time it's informing my daily choices when I Walk into the grocery store I like to know what they were thinking when they wrote that you know 'cause I've been forming me in so can we talk a lot of how you've come together and what how this new um phase\nHas has come together and how's it going\nWell I Would say well first of all that's that passion I'm In the realization that uh a big teenage dream bent the Ken was going to be wrapping up which took his about a year to admit I'm In putting a bone\nNow a big teenage dream bent the Ken was going to be wrapping up which took us about a year to admit I'm\nIn putting a bone that as a beautiful walk for us we got you know from my ... got cold out to LA and we thought it was to run for ... people um so we started that and we ended up in rooms with um this engineer and this person writing a song for hopefully Bieber and this person and re honor and all that and\nUh we realized it wasn't the doorway for us it was like immediately like okay you may ride for those people not through these doors or what's so what's missing\nWe realized it was very removed from the human\nAnd the humanity story the narrative of the person that we were writing for in fact they went in the room with us we're imagining what it might be for them that they might want that and a dime I Want and we realized we were about three rooms away from the from the heart of the song itself\nAnd so we're going to this beautiful frustrated conversation driving to a session all around civic drive in LA going around in circles because we're in passionately almost an\nArgumentative brother way in this inquiry together and we both agreeing we're just both ... speaking loudly the other and the idea was immediately born I'm the idea was what if we\nJust made space to take someone from inception to celebrating cells um either for the first time\nOr a reinventing artist walk that part as their brothers be all the things that we didn't let others be oh we never found for ourselves during a career out of what if we held a space for them to see themselves\nOr make a huge creative mass um distilling crystallize who they are into the songs all the ... of the songs and then from there goes deeply into the lyrical parts of the songs in deeply into the capturing prices and\nIn the conversation I think well the most beautiful part was was we realized that last I'd been a vocal coach for Twenty years and the coaching ... was firmly on my head\nThat I think it always been a mental and he hadn't done that as a session for someone directly they've been doing it all around his life and we kind of cold into being like oh I don't know if we could\nTotally do this his two brothers walks among from inception to celebrating themselves in them and that that works and that sounds in the world and so we got out of the camera and this is an idea\nAnd I was like yeah let's do it three weeks later we had our first person flying from Washington DC she was a young sixteen year old girl that was it can fan among said yes we went oh my God we have to actually put this together [laughter] and uh\nThe beautiful part of it was it she came out we created this journey er and er it was a it was a it was a success we went to the next next next next I'm about ten Chinese and we realized that there was a transformational experience that there was a a journey that gave someone an opportunity to not only arrive at their songs\nI'm In a way that they never experienced it also gave them a lens or to to walk a positive what they've that yet to value themselves you know the ... as an agency gives that reflective mirror of how valuable what they've been through this and that\nThat that it's a gift space for them to step into [noise] and so it will just blown open from that um we're step from the music industry into the transformational space which means something for everyone especially those that are frightened\nAh but have songs stock inside that they have music inside them and they know and they may have gotten down to the myriad of ways into talk themselves out of doing it to to stop singing\nYou know silenced in many ways [noise] part of the curiosity for us after so many years of senior and songs to to audiences we we still with fascinated with what\nCuriosity for hours after so many years of singing songs to to audiences\nWe we still were fascinated with ... bodies what goes into the out of a song you know we really asked ourselves that question and and didn't expect to know the ... and um with this kind of download the we we kinda came up with like a ten stage pros is\nBlowing up in the creative process and we looked at the old out chemical stages and and kind of lent on that as a metaphor for really starting with making a mess\nYou know and and letting things uh like digging a things up and and letting things future fires and letting things to\nReally talk yeah [laughter] yeah I think the mess and and getting\nUncomfortable yeah finding way you're uncomfortable finding where there is energy right where this movement where this change with is\nWhen something is is is happening inside your body right wanting to come out and so looking at that as like almost colors really\nUm and then looking in studying at all of the music that as ever made you really want to sing ... and and and getting curious about why what are the cause\nUh you know so we we looked at it and we call it a some of the musical cosmology so every single person that we've ever worked with has a distinct musical cosmology we find that we share a lot of songs with\nAlmost everyone we work with but they have their own ...\nAnd so for them to get to know that that colors and the and their emotional range that they typically typically go to but it it goes beyond style and genre\nOnce you look behind the songs you realize that depend no matter whether it's hip hop all country there's gonna be similarities with the songs that you particularly love\nAnd so we've loved really going behind styling genre to to look at songs in the kind of a kind of geometrical early or you know in colors um what some of his like in terms of\nIts it's amazing humans are so complex vocally all of us we have vocal you know complex vocal learning when musical beings dollar knew it you know we are built to saying we are built to understand complex music from an early age\nAnd and so you know just freeing people to be the musical selves I'm\n... has been amazing and to demystify the actual credit purses so that anyone can actually write a song and seeing it\nAnd and before we even did it with the anyone we literally went and tried to do with the anyone I just walked in fact I think it's completely highlighted then and sure enough the ... and like what Isaac said like um ... stage it's a\n... game we play called musical cosmology like we're still so blown away by the musical three lines that are um and it's ... we become as brothers made the ... research scientists empower wizards because there is a thing\n... uh uh that's there's that things on capture a bull cold seeing someone in a musical DNA through what it was that from the ...\nTo what they dream of water hits them at a date musical level and how that highlights who they are and have always wanted to be as a songwriter so it's just been sort of fascinating to\nPlan and the [noise] we'll be right back with our conversation\nThat's who they are and have always wanted to be as a songwriter so it's just been so fascinating to play him as a [noise] we'll\nBe right back with our conversation with ... corn that this isn't it that John Dillon here listening to part of the song a virtual coffeehouse her singer songwriters creative explorers and fan [noise]\nCome on the you know don't look we're making a mess dont look where we live and potentially endanger head of embarrassment\nUm but then there's this beautiful moment where you can type that critic and put them off on a throne and say okay here's the mess what do you love\nYeah right like use your genius\nCritical mind to then goes through and sift through an hunt down for metaphors golden metaphor golden cause that actually are the keynote about being\nYou know the resonating in in ... it's like we have these amazing a geometric prints on a on the edge of ...\nAnd anything you know in ... it's like we have these amazing a geometric prints on a on the edge of our blood here on our fingerprints you know ... prints they look like you know everyone is different\nAnd so everyone's musical you know keynote or musical imprint is\nDifferent ... and so it shows up in this in this game and I think the hottest part of the ... is actually the distillation knowing how to engage a creek in a way to know you know how to make those choices to make a mess and then make sense of ...\nAnd both being those valves like you know a lot of people don't lead them the mess valve open enough\nDon't create a space to do that said that they've already beginning to crystallize and fulfill on things that are still haven't it just all not all their ingredients afraid I'm One of the other thing is when we walk with someone you know my brother and I specialize in in different parts of the journey so we can be brought to and um you know\nHow in touch and how open or they can make a mess with what they've been through through the narrative through this story what what have they been through in their life then once fried and shed can be crystallized into song wow what an experience that is also um\nThen that's very much Isaac specialty that the hero that have been the heroic Johnny into narrative into lyric and my specialty is I'm a return to the whole body and strength to the voice to\nWhat happens when you fully in body into your instrument in combat or export again of ... oldest that to be felt that you've always had so it's really about reframing\nUh what's safe to experience in creating a safe space for someone to be radically expressive again so those two things and those two valves open particularly\nThe mess door to what they've been through and how valuable that is and the ... or if it's okay to be completely died off again and and the emotional\nAnd expressive against fully and ... and those two things open the rest really is just a fun game informing them into song and capturing them and recording them and those valves really those\nGateways for us to really help someone to the uh unimaginable that they wouldn't have to have done on their own and we come across very few people that know how to do that on their own and that that Hollywood so to speak\nWhich means the music business celebrates this lone wolf you know here's this guy or gal who's like Seventeen who's got it all together in the recording themselves and put out a mix tape or\nAn album and everyone's a journey Mitchell or Stevie Wonder well it's not necessarily always the case and we don't know behind all the stories all the time to realize the kind of help they had to see themselves [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI'm\n...\nWith John ... and you're listening to our this song of virtual coffeehouse for singers songwriters creative explorers and fans we're talking with either ... old brother's car in one\nOf your specialties is creating an original song with a large group of people could you describe that process and how it came about\nAgain it was an accident\nWe had a show planned the whole room thought that we were going to sing or a concert of can songs and we got up and says you said well I'm you all think we're going to sing I'm a concert now and we we will we will seeing some songs but really what we're doing tonight is that we're all going to write a song and then your going to sing it\nAnd you know to this day I think it still does this thing to the room where suddenly everyone's dealing with their own biology\nTotally you know the blood stops pumping\nI think it still does this thing to the room where suddenly everyone's dealing with their own biology\nTotally you know the blood starts pumping hands are getting sweaty and room town changes\nIn anticipation too yeah yeah yeah totally yeah for some go\nYes instead of having run for the\nDynamic range opens [laughter] it's it's pretty profound eight\nAnd ... not quite telling yet is that\nThe ... we we will always tried to find their edge together and we were invited to speak at this association of transformational latest event we knew is next level and we knew that they thought we were going to sing them songs and\nWe knew that this was a opportunity is on ready as we were to change the game entirely on ourselves in front of them and we were both so scared but when\nYou lose your mom and this was one of the moments were told was dragging me to I was a\n[noise] I didn't tell them how scared I was 'cause I knew that would help the wouldn't helped I knew all you're\nConfident that the reason is really changing the rules on how the laws and the reason we\nDid it is because we knew as a future um when you this is now a couple of years ago we knew that our future was in holding in space and saying I Know we have been this for the world at six months ago we began think something else there will be ...\nBecoming a journey men and facilitators if other people on the other thing sells easing song and\nA reclaiming their voice in this story in their life and what that does so we knew this was that time to just go we've never done this for doing it and\nIt worked and I was like I couldn't believe it and the um people got together in groups as we called the song down on the spot codes came to me melody we set a voice saying melodies we started breaking people off into groups me there is even a rap section it got while they got filmed\nAnd um we've been doing them ever since and the one that Steve fathers invent um uh was incredible because they've obviously created a great context for it and there was a very musical event that he put on a state as the music lover extraordinary [noise] uh and uh [noise] it was just a really beautiful moment to to work with\nJust such a vast\nA dynamic room of people that mostly had never written a song and had no idea they're about to ... and and simply\nQuite simply the process goes into the room so we asked them to get into the whole buddy instrument and then\nMake it sound on top no without thinking about it\nAnd so we we kind of notice that always what happens is that everyone stops divergent in their own space and then very quickly because we're also musical we choose to each other\nBut then so naturally we find the note of the room and so each year in to the room with your time together and so tired will have his guitar and he'll find that now and then he'll just start downloading himself\nWhat what chords come to him based on what he's getting from the room 'cause usually getting a lot of that point everyone's yelling and screaming\nAnd um and then from there we go okay um well you know we're\nAll download it was like we as humans we all have this incredible capacity\nFor creative intuitive or where it's like we have antenna but how often do we do we step into that clearing that space where you're not\nListening to well you're not really following thoughts you'll\nReceiving messages like you're receiving morality you're receiving ideas\nOkay and often maybe it's you know it takes a hike you on a hike or something and it's like the blood pumping and you're you're getting air and its movement ride like life follows movement and so music moves us it's\nYou're getting air and its movement right like life follows movement and so music moves us it's literally movement and so when you close your eyes and then we said look the person next to you is\nMore scared than you yes oh don't worry about them they're thinking about\nThemselves known you so let that go also\nClose your eyes no one knows that you I said I'm walking around the room with the microphone some\nStill playing the cards put your hand up if something's\nComing to you you know just so they know and he thought I mean I Am a lyric uh uh download anything and so their hands go up and it's it's astounding what comes through sometimes\nNo hands just one and then they start like once they realize what's happening and they it feels like it's a it's this commission and people are doing it then you know the answer to fly out on your dog is going and so ... I'm\nTrying to figure out that now you know to to how to improve our protests but ... um I Do my\nAbsolute best to capture what I Believe is the most um distilled and potent um melodies at the moment which means not that I'm discriminating I'm I'm looking for the clearest ideas that all the space in the room and and trying to keep them in my mind immediately they voting for all of the lyrics are\nComing back because usually they smell that he's come with lyrics like people yeah people just of the floodgates open\nAnd um and so then we slowly piece it together we ought to get two people have on stage to tell their Journey Through their work or um you know and then we all sing it together so it's um\nEntered sleeves we had a couple of um people come up with a big room will have a couple of people come up and hold space for the other was coming through them or what they're getting from the event that were at and it just crystallizing ... herself into a song and then we all sing it and um we have a and then we went away for that particular\nFor that for that song specifically and went and captured it and a sensitive or on a caption it properly and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Art Of The Song", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "14"}
