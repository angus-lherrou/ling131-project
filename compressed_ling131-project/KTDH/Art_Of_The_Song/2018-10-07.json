and\nI went into the air force and they sent me to California and studied Chinese and I never left a California except when they say China of course but\nOther than that I never left California again

studied there yes I still have a couple of friends that I went to deal with it's a very stringent a program and they they do a lot of a careful filtering so the people that finally make it in there are pretty much the same you know they're they're interested in bright or\nThey don't have to be educated but they do have to be intelligent mhm mhm so do you learn to speak\nChinese fluently\n[laughter] I wouldn't say that I like to but they thought so for a moment there yeah I Know that I dated a Chinese Girl for a while and and when I met her parents I spoke to the Chinese of course and they said oh you speak a Chinese of rural whoa [laughter] and I thought so why are you talking to me in English\nIn [laughter] so I assume than uh I I'm not the wizard I\nThink you are for the right yes yeah it's not that I once in a while I was [laughter] but I just read\nThat you grew up in Philadelphia Virginia and Africa\nWhen my father got sent over there\nAh during the war he was recalled during the\nKorean War and they needed him so desperately for the Korean War that they send them to Africa ...\nYeah the government hasn't changed much [laughter] right [laughter] what was it like growing up was fabulous yeah no and also it was a it was French Morocco so everybody either smoke or not Farsi but some sort of African language I don't know when the rocking might be but they also spoke French\nAnd my father spoke French and so I started learning French uh\nDa da da da da da da da da da da da da\nDa da da da\nDa da da da da\nDa da da da da da da du they just go their own

strongly you guys doing All right\nDa da\nDa da\nDa da da\nDa da da da\nDa\n\nDa da and the more I drink recorded live for art at a song that you can be found on his two thousand sixteen released alive at last this is John Dillon with fitness\nBut you're listening to our new song a virtual coffeehouse for singer songwriters creative explorers and fans\nOver time you said you've gotten quite good at what was it like in the early days\nYou know uh I've always been lucky I I I've been making a living there since I was sixteen I had a recording contract of sixteen I've I've played with everybody I mean when I was sixteen I I knew ... and I do tennis Doherty and I knew you know\nThese people John Phillips and you know I met them when they were at in the nation see of their careers and uh and they were very encouraging and I and I was already\nPlaying you know playing music and I must have been good enough at it to get paid because I made more than my father the first year I did it you know\nAnd so [noise]\nMust have been good enough at it to get paid because I'm I I made more than my father the first year I did it you know and so that and girls you know where the main path [laughter] main reason why you are actually it should be girls and then on his way right was that pretty much the driving force [laughter]\nAnd they're even if they can figure out first like yeah I I mean the shock words have shifted through the years but that was the that was the initial urge\nTo tell us a little bit about your writing process for us show up with the pen on the planet nine AM and a cup of coffee and you sit down and you're right or are you a lightning bolt person what how do you how did that work for you\nI it's probably all of those things but I don't write all the time uh I don't formerly right all the time but I mean every time I get in the car\nTo I don't even understand the idea of of people having a a I'm a what do they call that a providers block I I've never had a writer's block in my life I mean if if I Can't think of anything right now I can simply go into my phone or my cassette player back then and and play one of the five or six thousand ideas I haven't\nFollowed through on yet you know so and and and um most of the time I write in response to something you know I used to ride alright love song as much I used to write songs about women in my efforts to get near that you know uh and then I started getting involved in the world and and the songs changed\nIn the last Thirty years of American politics of really a sharp into my pen I think so I mean there is no right to protest songs because I think that's essentially masturbation it'd be the only people to dig protest songs with people who already believe what you're saying about so so whose mind you're changing you know\nSo do you think music can change our I Try and do I do I think you can\nDefinitely changed your the way you think but I don't think you can do with a hammer you know what I mean I think you have to so how do you do it I have this protest\nSong called what would you do and I wrote it during the uh the end of the Bush\nThe appointed Bush presidency you know and and I thought that I when I wrote in the course was what would you do say it's all up to you say the whole world is in your hands would there be change over\nThings be the same and we already done all we can write things like that so just because I just want people to think if if he if they'll just think\nThings would be different asking the right\nQuestions yeah exactly and then\nGet out of the way I don't want to tell them what to think but I I Would like them to at least think there is no way that Donald Trump could have been a presidential candidate\nTwenty years ago or Thirty years ago and certainly not in the sixties when I was a teenager coming up we would have been laughable that someone so ill equipped for such a job what even run let alone be supported by the the hierarchy of of the Republican Party what do you think\nHas happened that it's allowed that to happen oh I think it's it's simple and uh we we have had a complete defunding of the education system in this country for ... ever since we took Nixon down or\nIn the early seventies or the Republican Party has wanted\nTo you know take down a Democrat I think that they recognize when when we protested the Vietnam War and we protested the Watergate and we raised a lot of noise and a lot of Halloween we stopped at war and we stopped the president and I really think that the powers that be went you know we cannot have\nA populist this educated\nBecause if we do we can't leave them around by the news and read the statistics now do you know that forty percent of all Americans right now I don't even read one book a year\nThirty percent of them are are are barely literate I mean we have a nation of sheep you know and I think that's how this happened that that and then and then uh the Republican\nBarely literate I mean we have a nation of sheep you know and I think that's how this happened that that and then and then uh the Republican Party began to really depend upon the religion of far right religion you know and and putting that it into politics I mean the founding fathers\nKept religion out of politics for a perfectly good reason that you read the federalist papers you'll see that they spent twelve years trying to figure out how to make this thing work\nIt's a fascinating book recommended the federalist papers yeah it's ... it's all the original guy all the original yeah it's their letters and they're like it's unbelievable\nHow you see how intelligent and help her out of the cases they were and how and how committed and how a\nPassionate caring about\nYou know what could happen to you know Jefferson referred to this is the ... the great experiment Kennan Kennan people govern themselves you know I mean it's humbling and make you make you wait to read that stuff and then I think that Donald Trump ... throughout the Muslims was like [noise]\nYou know he's just another fascist it really should be removed from the planet you can quote me\n[laughter] I Love what you're talking about with it's the nature of the passion and the caring yeah I guess that's the fundamental\nBasis for education is it you're curious and you care yeah and it also has to be a ... thing that has that has to exist and you need\nYou do research you're curious about stuff you find out and\nI'm Glad that you brought up the American experiment my nephew is working on that um it for the DNC right now at ... in Pennsylvania but that's what he keeps referring to announce he's an absolute\nDevoted political and said because this is it's an experiment and it's just mind boggling to see how well it ... how if I told him\nI just read a really really tragic thing which I what I just put on Facebook but I'll send it to you or I Can't think of who wrote it was a sociologist and uh he was lucky he ... he says we stand back and look over the broad picture and that every fifty or Seventy five years or something or I forget\nThe number of years he ... he said that we get together and we\nRaise somebody's stupid and we'd kill each other off we do it\nOver and over and over again and he says that the rise of someone like you know like a bigger than seeing them for like a like Donald Trump to be considered a leader a charismatic leader you know because if because he's speaking to the to the lowest common denominator in east and he's trying to incite\nA their anger and their rage as though he was the one that would champions for them in government which is a complete fallacy you know ... but in any event he said that we do it every so often numbers why we're going to be doing it again uh unless we stop something and he says that\nPutting Donald Trump in in the White House it would be the first step into the next we're on the disaster\nSo it was also the greed thing you know you can't have all the money in one place and all the rest of us scrambling when you get enough people with nothing to lose your revolution yep every single time\nWe'll be right back with more from our conversation with James leaf Stanley stem nothing with John ...\nYou're listening to argue with that song a virtual coffeehouse her singer songwriters creative explore\nWe had our son are proud media partners was brand new music now committed to filling the arts education gap funding music programs that foster continue on learning and Put Students on a clear path to school and lifestyle\nThe arts

Danley with worry about you from his two thousand sixteen CD alive at last this is a business with John Doe and you're listening to artifice Tong what would you offered to someone\nWho's coming up in the music business today oh I Would\nThem simply you follow your heart and and also you or emulate the great there you don't have to invent the wheel to reinvent the wheel or you know respect those people that have been a long time and what they're doing but\nFollow your heart I Know that I I was assigned to asylum once and they told me that I couldn't play the guitar 'cause that\nWasn't the studio guitar players or someone else will be playing the songs and and I and we we recorded three songs where I wasn't involved and at the end of the third son and I I excused myself and went right\nOut and hired an attorney and got out of that contract and and part of it was it had to destroy those tapes I just thought\nThis was not I didn't get in this business yeah to not play music you know what I mean they wanted to make or I don't know what they want things so to make money\nAnd they wanted to happen to use me to do it and and the deal and listen to this kid's this is important detail you listen you could just record this one song because Tucson could be hit and then you can do whatever you want that's complete crap because if you had a hit song than everybody that love that song\nCame to you because of that song and if you do write songs like that\nBecause if you had a hit song than everybody that love that song came to you because of that song and if you do write songs like that they're going to fall away from you in a heartbeat\nYou know how many one had wonders can you can you think of you know that did a song they were told to do and it was like nothing else on their album and and they you know they couldn't they couldn't bring the people with them you know\nYou do what you do and get better at it practice every day it's and and if you don't practice if you're not prepared for the show you're being arrogant and stupid\nBecause of it because the audience deserves you respect and you deserve to respect you know you have to I Love that you have to print deserve your respect yeah but I mean you you need to be prepared to to earn their respect you know I just did a show with somebody that\nYou know that ... was famous and and and they were so ill prepared I I was stunned I thought how can you go up there and and and show such a dramatic lack of respect for for your legacy and for and for your audience for yourself how could you do that you know\nPractice every day that you cannot get away with it any other way\nWords of wisdom and to the passion and that and hearing your voice and in the word you choose and the passion and a deep caring for that music and the deep respect that you\nA love music I just think that we would we would all be postal without it you know [laughter] I also think that that uh there's a lot of music that that appeals to\nThe wrong part of our ah spears you know say more about that I I just I mean I hear songs that are that are just\nSpiritually in the toilet you know in in various uh that that you know there's a value system and there's a disregard for about the value system and and and the value system it can be the ten commandments that can be whatever you want but it but there's some basic\nBasic kindness and respect some reciprocity with those things that has to happen between humans you know and and when you when you do music where when you're and you're disregard that or your subject by this regards that were you know benches and hose and all that kind of stuff is like\nYou know you can't you can change it but you can't change it by attacking it because as soon as you attack somebody what do they do they put up their guard that's what they do and\nYou know and the perpetrator rather than on the surface rather than invading an analog I was playing this club in Milwaukee and uh and I was doing some song and some guy came in and he was delivering the drunken loud and he and the crowd ... wasn't upon my hand you know and he started shouting an and I\n... yelling something at the stage and I got all set to just cut 'em to ribbons because I Know how to do that you know I can I'm I'm a\nI'm fast and I have an arsenal of ah of insults that I can use to liberal elite audience and it sort of shape\nAnd as I got ready to do it I I looked at it and I realize that this was this was a lonely\nOr hurting man and I said hey hey uh I I appreciate you know how to set your I said I don't know why but I can tell you that all these people here and and me were just sitting here playing some years they can kind of\nConnecting with each other and I said I'd sure like to invite you to sit down and be part of that\nAnd he told me what I can do with myself and left\nBut I mean yeah you know and I did I did and I didn't go down that that that stupid violet road and I was just poised to you know I Will not that it's not in you know I have a lot of it yeah yeah but it's for some reason I Want to wait a minute this guy is in trouble\nAnd I will not that it's not in you know I had a lot of like all of it\nBut yeah yeah but it is for some reason I Would wait a minute this guy is in trouble and you're going to make it worse I don't understand making it worse I don't get that as a as a concept you know if you just\nThink of that one thing I might ... what would I Do is what I'm doing this you get better or is it making it worse if it's making it worse maybe you ought to be
