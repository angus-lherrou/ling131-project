it\nIs a long standing dream of mine to have a an old adobe you know all the years that I live here I never lived in New Mexico I never had an adobe I always lived\nIn you know some somebody's garage somewhere a tent or a gp or whatever\nBut it was always a dream of mine to have an old adobe and this\nJust as one of those lucky things that I lucked into but when I saw this place\nAnd saw this beautiful living room and everything I imagine the songwriter workshops and it was within a year buying it that we started having a songwriter workshops up here and it's just been and and just incredible experience and we just missed I'm John ... was here with you correct this\nJohn's fourth year of running the the workshop with me along with John Richmond ah from Allen most other yes we have done Richmond my son says\nGoes my producer and John Gorka that's our June workshop and it's so fun and we just cover so much ground and and we're in this\nGreat environment it's it's really been a wonderful for everyone and in August this coming August you have another workshop coming up with Mary Shay that's right that's our fault workshop or end of August workshop uh marry this'll be Mary second year we had an Gretchen Peters has\nThe same year but I'm Gretchen will be in Europe this year so we've had to go shake ilk us in one there in the fall and extraordinary\nOpportunity for people to take time out I'm just for themselves to come and spend time with them use that's\nRight we cover a lot of ground and we ... it what's interesting about teaching songwriting is that ... that whether people are just starting out or are further down the line a lot of the same rules apply I mean if you're just beginning we don't want to tell people you don't want them to edit too much we just want them to start the creative process\nAnd be you know feel safe to even start but for the most part though a lot of the same rules apply with songwriting a lot of ... we're in where you get your inspiration from and and\nI Am sure you find this with people as you interview that um that you see these teams are merging and songwriting it doesn't really matter what sort of level you're that you think you're at it it's more about what do you call drawing on inside of yourself\nWell since you brought that up a let's talk about over the span of the past twenty albums secular area is your twin his release that's right what would you say the over arching um\nSeem has been for your work from the beginning from your first CD perhaps ... do you sense that there's an overarching theme or an overarching a topic that you tend to re re address throughout your work\nThat's that is a good way of putting it because\nIf I put my all my records and the end and and ended up here you you would see this as in a lot of ways a combination of of everything because on all my records there was always this\nOne or two songs that were an adverse or sometimes even more that we had to do with my sort of lifelong quest for some kind of sense of meaning and a sense of of of following the mystery of of who we are and why we're here and\nWhat his mortality and ... what is mortality bring out innocent ... avoiding mortality all those things that that that shape us\nAnd shape our belief systems and so I've been exploring those things are like many people from my generation uh since I was first starting to make music and make a record so there's always been that sense in my records that I was always very careful too\nUh since I was first starting to make music and make a record so there's always been that sense in my records that I was always very careful to\nYou know keep a very well rounded balance of songs on my record so that it wasn't too much into this sort of spiritual thing or what sort of I Would get labeled because of the few times that I did explored I was labeled a new age artist which I hate it because I I didn't really agree with the new age movement and I thought I thought it was very um ... at\n... in a way and and and I'm I'm really\nTrying to understand things as a as a seam and almost a scientific manner and so this record in a way of taking some of those older songs redoing them rewriting them and then writing new ones finding songs that fit a theme that really um do explore\nReligion or a spiritual experience without a religious ideology and because I think that has been ... religious ideology\nIs one of the most dangerous forces in the world today so um but how do we have to throw out our our our desire to sing\nTogether and sing a communicate together have enjoyed communion\nA question the mystery of being a state of wonder um grief together love together what what kind of music uh works for people who don't fit within religious ideologies\nBut still who want to be grateful how to how you how do you show gratitude without having to name a deity you know or do you have to even\nEven say who it is you're grateful to you know you still feel yourself in the state of gratitude so I wanted these songs to have those kinds of of a feeling and that kind of connection to something but I never wanted to state what that\nWould that thing was because that's a personal thing and I think the imposition of of religion is is is really destructive and there's something\nSo universal and not you know in the application like ... when you have a song that anyone\nCould sing you're appealing to a universal code that sit imbedded in us that is really true and and that sort of the things that I have a song on the record called sanctuary which really is just says\nI'm now are with me you know it says to all these things are with me they are with me and I just incredible gospel singer San butler who's saying with the five blind boys for twenty five years and amazing gospel singer ... sang it with me and did one of the verses and but I never say who now is\nWe sing our best when nobody's listening you know just naming all these things the frog in the evening birds and and uh it was so\nSo much in the moment and one of the most ecstatic states for humans I think is actually when we are just sitting with nature and when we shut up enough to let nature sing to us and that may be one of our highest calling as human beings it's just simply witness\nThe beauty of creation if really if there was a purpose for humans I Would say it would be a witness\nWith our big brain would be a witness\nThe awesome notice of what has been created that we get to observe and and be part of instead we have of course gone to battle over at that or destroyed it but but I I Would think our highest calling would be just be it's a ... to witness it into um nurture\nBut [laughter] so that song effort in Nineteen forty nine that's where her head was at and that really shows I think also the sort of foundation and which I grew up which was very non religious but very nature oriented and\nThat the community with nature was a big deal in my family and and I I wanted to honor that it on this record so this is a this is the solitary sing\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm [noise]\nGod comes down like a flying models good he has ... ... with us for food um oh my goodness and win lonely\nLeasing\n[noise] listen [noise] oh a\nMocking bird in a\nTree and buses on I actually\nNo no but he knows\nAnd buses throw on I Sweden no no but he knows he's eh Disney\n... in\nThe ... best when nobody's listening no Mm buddies and\nMm Mm Mm Mm\nI come on like a heron wing honeys\n...\nThat's when I like to sit in saying no\n... but I don't care [noise] out in\n... and I know for a ... double the [noise]\nAll of his own ... and ... you know and from the sea\nAnd play [noise]\nShe sang ...\nWhen nobody's listening and know that is the ...\nUm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm [noise]\nYeah ... was solitary singer live for our little song solitary singer was adapted from a poem by his grandmother\nAnd there's something so powerful and when I found powerful in the song was um something so powerful it actually knowing the names of the different birds and the names of the different trees and then you know that they serve a different purpose\nSo true and naming is also I'm part of witnessing ... and that is um it it's funny that's what my my dog when when I sometimes I'll take her whole bag of toys\nAnd throw it on the ground and she'll go over and with her nose he'll count to put her nose on each thing it's like here's this thing this thing and I think that\nWay we live in the birds we were like that one and I want to know the name of that one I Want to know the the coloration of that and I want to know the song of that and my grandmother was a ... major birders she that was her thing\nSo she went everywhere and that her name was ...\nI mean it has to like often bird tangent right now in my head so I'm going to have to reel it back in ... he saw it was like that yeah you're as well\nThat was another one of ... that was a called conservation and that's one that I really rewrote with her because I'm In Nineteen Seventy um when she was just before she passed she sent this poem to the entire family that was called ultimate conservation and it was um\nA poem about how don't she talked about how all these different\nCultures that a man had locked himself into a box or some kind of tumor or whatever to to glory glorify himself and her the whole point of the song was just throw me in the ground and plant a tree over me and maybe some day a little bird will\nSit on the branches and seeing my name now that was all she ever wanted from fame was just sort of bird might\nSome day a little bird will sit on the branches and sing my name and that was all she ever wanted from fame was just sort of bird might sing her name some day and it was so beautiful we I remember at the time I was pretty young and\nI we were all the whole family was really floored by this thing and then she died and they put this poem away and when I was a\nMaking the record I remembered this ultimate conservation and I cut my two of my answers still live there in their late nineties and I emailed them they do email and I emailed her to ... do you remember conservation do you remember this\nThis incredible poem that you're that were ... ... feet he wrote I'm at and they both are back said honey we don't know what you're talking [laughter] wait our our member [laughter]\nAnd uh so I I kept after them please try look through your papers I Know it was there we were all freaking out about it for ... and I had to give up and I was so bombed and\nThen about a month later my oldest aunt Neal Ninety eight years old I've got this email I found it and she had been looking for it to her papers and she found it and so she sent it to me and it was very old fashioned or you know my grandmother's poetry style was very old school\nYou know romantic kind of thing and very formal and it but there were lines in there that just blew my mind and so I I kind of financial dinner wrestled with it and\nUh and then added this chorus too that I probably put words in her mouth [laughter] I'm sure I did um because it really took it beyond God you know and and more\nJust into an earth based thing and and uh and and put it costs to it and then made it into a like a gospel ten which was really fun because I loved it sort of like an anti gospel tongues I put it in the gospel format but it's all about that there is no God so I [laughter] that was\nA ... a lovely I Ernie\nAnd uh so um that's\nConservation and that's the one that Shawn Colvin uh things to do with me on this is beautiful\nMhm [noise] Mm [noise] Mm [noise] Mm\n[noise] ancient King I'm ancient Rome prominent\nIn and do that and\nDo their own far from the ground\nUp to ...\nAnd ...\nAnd then for him\nIn the ... and ... and\nThe one\nHand\nHand away and can learn\nAnd a later and\nHave no job\nKing Day and you\nKnow around the\nSetting Sun out his mind saying\nOh I'm all day and go

feel safe to go inside and feel something that we need to feel it because otherwise we're going to shut down and and if if we shut down we are lost if we lose touch with\nWith our humanity then become calloused than we are lost and so I think that's one of the ... one of the positive things that music can do I don't think music can save the world or any of the you know it's not that lofty to me but if music can keep the heart open\nThan the heart will will find a way to the heart will is a good conscience and and so um that's a small\nIt's a heart open than the heart will will find a way that
