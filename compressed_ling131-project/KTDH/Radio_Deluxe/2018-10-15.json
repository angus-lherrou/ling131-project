records too so I don't know if you would like to continue at this point in time or if you want me to record that play it's a new record this is a new record from a man named Jose James\nHe uh I Believe it's an album of bill withers songs well cold lean on me Jose James was a student of\n... in Minnesota and ah he earned Minnesota yes we're on ... and then he listens all the time and then he brought me\nBrought Jose Jose to my attention because I was working with them out at a at the Hollywood Bowl and he said Jose James is one of my students and he has made quite a career for himself so

and\nMy father used to listen to Joe Mooney\nRehearsed the group that Sandy's Hollywood bar and grill in Paterson and I believe that's why when my father would rehearse with me\nIt's a here's all the song goes and we just play it like a bucket you're right the court said no just follow what I'm doing and I think what because Joe couldn't see so they just cordial Mooney would say here's what you're going to play on the clarinet but what are you hooked up ... you know and that's how they can write anything down so here is the culmination of a\nA of what they do on tea for two so from an a a

family is my my other daughter oh\nBack to defer to\nLet's just great fun and it's still yet to ... ... yeah and uh actually even even uh like Allen Bergman money came here and we think tea for two and he would eat how much he loved that group I was very\nIt was just an amazing a unique sound and I got to meet a page Kavanaugh\nWhiz bill ... at the old Catalina bar and grill in Los Angeles and a page was talking about\nHow they would write little ... do different things on lyrics to try to be a little cooler with their jazz trio sound and with how they were inspired by Joe Mooney and page Kevin a trio\nUh was another offshoot of this Joe Mooney kind of sound and they do the song any I Would do anything for you\nI was looking and I found it on iTunes ... it's called something for you I

that's great 'cause my terrific you know so you see how it it made its way up to the west coast yeah and the it just the the whole were so excited about all of that I mean I remember page talking about that a\nAnd also it's you know what is it at the same I Know this is totally off the subject but at the same meeting that I was sitting with ... page cabinet and a guy named Eddie Collins and\n... and it was one of the great jazz photographers of all the time and ... I think uh did some work in fashion and he's and I noticed on Eddie's lapel he had a zebra\nAnd I said a zebra and each well he goes well there's only two restaurants in the United states I mentioned one in Los Angeles and Gino don't say gene I Know and and that's a long ago was and I remember going back to Gino at the time and I said the front of fungal\nThat said any comments he goes oh Mr ... is so all the time you would just come in sometimes with the sauce he said he'd come in with the models heat send people in and build collections said as a matter of fact and he said to me once\nJust go to Gino and say you know ... you know is it what we call one of the great red sauce places all time I was going their way before I met you I mean at any\nTime that would be a porn star there would be Monica Lewinsky a bunch of nuns and Tom Brokaw I mean you just never knew that it's going to be in that place as a matter of fact that's a one night build daily the late bill Daley who was on new heart\nBob Newhart show and he was also on I Dream of Jeannie and I remember walking in and there was built daily behind me going\n... it's really and he was ... in the army and that's how we knew why was the jazz but that's you're always run into I met David Halberstam at the bar a diet which we've gone so far astray [laughter] so anyway to close the whole thing out when I was making my beetles record\nI said to Don I said what's do when I'm sixty four sort of been a Joe Mooney kind of style so Don got out as trustee accord\nNew heart Bob Newhart show and he was also on the I Dream of Jeannie and I remember walking in there was bill Daley behind me going\n... it's really and he was ... in the army and that's how we knew who I was ... jazz but that's you've always run into I met David Halberstam at the bar a dietitian we've gone so far straight [laughter] so anyway to close the whole thing out when I was making my beetles record\nI said to Don I said what's do when I'm sixty four sort of been a Joe Mooney kind of style so Don got out as trustee accordion we've got Ken ... to play the role of Andy Fitzgerald and re Kennedy played a little piano and we sort of made a a\nA Joe Mooney page Cavanaugh a tribute\nTo uh uh yeah and we did when I'm sixty four that style so closing up his little segment of course with me 'cause it all\nRevolves around me eventually so here's when I'm sixty four the John ... really quintet we're getting closer to that that's right they never would it would just as a joke when I first made directly on radio deluxe\n\nWhen I get older and losing my many years from now\nWhen you do visit any amount of time but they greetings bottle of wine if they're not\n\nYeah\nI'm really na\nNa\nWell the ... oh\nIsn't that\nDon't\n\nNo\nNo no no oh\nNo\nMay and\n... my mom [noise]\nNo one is\nTo low uh [noise]\nWell my mom [noise]\nNo um is that [noise]\nYou know uh [noise]\nMy man [noise]\nWell\nAh [noise]\nI\nIsn't\nIsn't probably\nWell um\nThat ah the\nAh um\nWell [noise]\nMaybe\n[noise]\n\nJudy Collins and just a beautiful record of sending the clowns now my question to you is I may be wrong but that's really like the first big Sondheim hit song isn't it or I mean\nYeah you know she had I mean the yes she had to hit the oh you mean other than the ... from the show yes yeah and in a how prince tells a really great story about that because they were I think they're I don't know if they were in Boston I think they were both at try and get a little bit music of course that's where it's from\nAnd he just knew that ... the ... the lead woman character needed and that sort of eleven o'clock moment he didn't know what it should be but it you know and so he said to Steve like overnight you write me she needs to have a moment it needs to be something about this\nAnd he came in the next day with that and they put it into the Matney and ... you know how it is very modest student says like you know I don't really know that much about music which of course silly\nBut he said everyone when he played it when Steven Simon I played it on the piano everyone around them right and so he said oh well that's it [laughter] and that was it\nWas amazing isn't it yeah you might have a place up at this juncture least do well I uh I've seen that they've McKenna has a new album out and it's it's hard for a man has been cut a way yeah to have made record but the there find a a a there will be a new album I think it's called live in Madison\nA an and there are no tracks available yet but it got me thinking about the McKenna one of the great red so there'd be mastering some life thing that he did yeah well not even close to ... ... it wasn't even released\nYou said that we hit the basic isn't it yeah uh you might see something at this juncture please do well I yeah\nI've seen that deep McKenna his new album out ... and it's it's hard for a man is the way to have made record but that defined I there will be a new album I think it's called live in Madison\nAnd and there are new tracks available yet but it got me thinking about the mechanics one of the great red ... he did yeah but not even close to ... and they had was released before I say OK\nAlive session harbors just putting it up as a matter of fact uh but I found from an employee piano solo Dave McKenna playing ... and it's hard to find single songs by deep mechanic 'cause he played so many ... mentally mhm he would just like Middle Eastern\nTonight or space because he said and so many times so much time just sitting in the hotel lobby playing one thing after another musical connection yeah so but here he is playing a song called ... and this is actually it's a well anyway\nThis is one of my favorite songs deep McCann and one of my favorite piano players might chew on radio deluxe\n\n\nWhen\nThey\nUp\nThere for\nThe for\n\nThe river\nFor her\nFor\nHer and I think\nThat's\nBig\n\n\n...\nNot perfect but they're they're they're they're
