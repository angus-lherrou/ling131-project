this week\n[noise] yeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response yup ...\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing the stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife for forty years and asked her head this ever happened to

emails from dads who are good dads they're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say I always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you own murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send because what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone um\nI Hope I

men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also that it's important for daughters to tell her father's about this so

happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you\nSo if you were a father and you have a ... of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to

years ProPublica has reported that President Trump's sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore\nThe question is what regulators can do about it and why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nBut severe as as the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on her return means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS finds evidence of wrongdoing severe a sad it can

is all things considered I melted\nChang and I'm Ari Shapiro many people in the U.S auto industry are breathing a sigh of relief this week the new trade deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada and mumps of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd will finish senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies and make auto parts you are in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement where you're holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well injured after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compared to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries can add to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum\nUs so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there is some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before they finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrorists for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have to keep in mind as they have been that particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude that this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement is worse\nI think for the United states perspective one of the things in the United states said little pool through lists\nFat so this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states would like to see the two countries roll up their sleeves used his fame energy they use to conclude that this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement is worse well\nI think for the United states perspective one of the things in the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there's no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral ... that from North America in our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have the the administrative costs and we're gonna have to work really hard with all three parties can minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge fits we look for that Greenland\nAnd Wilson is senior vice president of the motor and equipment

migrant families earlier this year that it wasn't even ready to how the children nor did it even had a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the d._a. jets inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel\nHey also so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with the policy of separating families but why isn't new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures to Nielsen\nIt is important to note that these miners are very well taken care I don't believe that they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that the age as held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to have children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and it's just and after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere's no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds would find any child in our care for any parent\nH H s by the way cared for children after they were separated while da Jess had custody of their parents and at the time da just said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nA central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nAnd then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nSo have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nDa chest doesn't say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the age has also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies ...\nAre there any children still haven't been reunited with their parents\n[noise] oh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to

FBI a lot of top Republicans are fine with that I asked John Cornyn the number two Republican as he got into an elevator earlier today\n[noise] I don't know when we heard from ever says\nOf course referring to last week public testimony Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley had said something similar Democrats say this makes no sense of the whole point of following up was to confirm or

[noise]\nSometimes they re interviews that very common [noise]\nAnd that's an investigation it's got to be more than just check the box okay we have their accounts\nOkay so clearly there is a big

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro survivors of sexual assault are sharing their stories many for the first time Washington Post columnist Monica ... has been getting a steady stream of them in her inbox\nAt our latest column has the headline deer dads your daughters told me about their assaults this is why they never told you how many people have been sharing this column on line that I spoke with Monica has to you about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of survivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I've never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reasons they never told their father\nSome women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail\nSome women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him that would make him cry ... someone in did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect and the and he would feel like he failed\nIt only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well [noise] I did get responses\nFrom people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different category it's a lot of when and said I told my mother and learns that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world\nAs a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of taboos in this area exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain explain what you mean by that [noise] you know it just just think about\nTropes in sitcoms where the dad and sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife\nI thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world as a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of ... just because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain explain what you mean by that [noise] you know it just just\nThink about tropes in sitcoms where the dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery store that he can ever make we do that with ... and we do that with breast feeding\nAll of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on a spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on the spectrum of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women\n[noise] can you tell us about some of the responses that you have to call them since it was published this week [noise]\nYeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response God please\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing the stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions\nI shared your call in with my wife of forty years and asked her had this ever happened to her and she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready\nI didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi\nWell so I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads they're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say\nI always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you on murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send because what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone\nUm so I think that these are conversations that I've just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of the conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also but it's important for daughters she told her father's about the sort of have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time\nBecause of what we're hearing and the the Kavanaugh for hearings because their fathers have said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAt is causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago\nAnd I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you so if you were a father and you have a Simpsons of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really needing full to hear from women in your life that you're close to who said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is why\n[noise] mark I have to use the Washington Post columnist on her new novel\nMe it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago\nAnd I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you so if you were a father and you have a ... of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this\nIs why Monica have to use the Washington Post columnist and her new novel out this week is

beginning to suffer from dementia Donald Trump tried to change his father's well what happened\nThat was right in Nineteen Ninety at Donald Trump's darkest financial moment he was facing being forced into bankruptcy by his creditors and he had some lawyers right up a causal a change to his father's will that would give him much more control over all those assets\nHe didn't tell his father or his siblings he was doing this he just had the lawyers show up at his father's house I believe it was and put a piece of paper in front of him\nHis father or somebody in the room realized right away this

has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that

there were audits there's evidence that the trumps didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser\nGrossly undervalued some of the properties\nRusted Newton or is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today\nThanks for having me are the New York times story you gets hurt it now says that Trump's were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nAnd NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators where either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do that\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel ... says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax finding as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are on the global side this seems to go beyond that\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades to simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been now with\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns as

wheel for decades when it comes to a transactions along on the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump family taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump's sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore\nThe question is what regulators can do about it and why use damage of heroes as if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nBut ... says the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on her return means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS find evidence of wrongdoing severe as it can retroactively force Fred Trump's heirs to
