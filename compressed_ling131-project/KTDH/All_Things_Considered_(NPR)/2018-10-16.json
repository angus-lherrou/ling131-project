News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari\nOr is it support this NPR station this is all things\nConsidered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro women in prison are far more likely than men to get punished for lesser violations of prison rolls and\nShares investigative team has been digging into this disparity this week today NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's presence here's the sound\nWe associate with prison [noise]\nHeavy steel doors finding shot [noise]\nThese are the doors at the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women but once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it there are no more heavy steel doors for the women that's not a family here\nBecause this prison is new and it's different inside the razor wire please cooks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from Don ... depending on what level there and that's the warning show Tom showing us around and do what we do that and the community of right now are far outside in our yard where they had I guess it's still a\nPrison the war in the first the point that out and prisons are still harsh places in some ways women's prisons are specially harsh because across the country women get discipline that higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rolls\nThey're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insulin disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatched with NPR in ... school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infraction can have big consequences\nWomen get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges that matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today they could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that it's curious yeah that's really not a security issue maybe she had a cop each day I have one\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen aren't data found women at this prison compared demanded other Iowa prisons were three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow Don ... corrections officers to give out fewer tickets like for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform\nIt was written for a men's prison were assured inside out or sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat that's the thing gang related just women want to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nNominate putting in place of practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison every corrections officers being trained that women take different pounds the prison they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing rules especially about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more into demand compliance Latin [noise]\nOn the mental health ward\nOn the mental health ward Stacey runners in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with a slate gray coat wonders an inmate she came to this prison twenty two years ago\nIt was really hard not to get in trouble back then you had to be careful of everything you did it felt like everything was [noise]\nIt's just meant to be punished\nOnce she was sick and stayed in herself through breakfast another prisoner brought up and down of from the dining hall and put the fire pillow talk to sleep when this crime happened [laughter]\n... got punished for that banana\nPossession of stolen item yeah that was pretty rough that\nWouldn't be a violation today but back then wonder says she wants good conduct credits those are days taking off her sentence for good behavior and she lost privileges she couldn't buy things from the commissary\nWonder is serving time per second degree murder now she says the changing the way women are treated here help to grow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nI'm trying to contribute as much as I can ... so I'm not a shame you know and it's helped me with my own my own shame in my own regret\nThe psychiatric unit in the newly built prison with designed to be different women are free to walk about the large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV's a garden and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now\nDr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nToo so there there were still here and then\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's presidents several years ago he quit a psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I Would seize and psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that have been changed for months at a time in the basement sold his property victims of satanic rituals but it goes even beyond that because then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison that long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dump the warden\nMainly the correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker it's a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe war has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought forward some concerns and what she said it you know ordinary people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there is one of you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get a Ninety six cannot cash problems\nTom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health board it's the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down\nIt's the one of their place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now if closed four years ago\nAnd it's the one other place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now closed four years ago\nThere are ... themselves a guard would watch separated from a station above when women with mental illness lived here they would often yell into the night this is what prison cells to do across the country you really look like for women or men\nYou dehumanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room that\nStripped them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nThat gets back to wipe keeping up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for a lesser infractions often lead to ending up in the cell block like this one Joseph Shapiro NPR News\nLaura how women running prisons are making a difference in the way they are rough you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n\nThis is Angie ... for all things considered\nReminding cans and that you only have a few minutes really left to register to vote and the November sixth election\nAnd then I went out he wrote me to come here had to yeah he had to leave Saudi Arabia come here and you know given what's happened is suspected murder\nWill have to wait and see whether the crown princes repressive tendencies are even worse than what people were fearing thank you Jacki thanks very NPR's Jackie\nNortham started crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has developed a close relationship with Jared Kushner President Trump's close advisor and son in law during her time with the White House that relationship now faces more scrutiny after ... disappearance\nAnd pure White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe is here to tell us more about Cushing has role in shaping U.S foreign policy including port Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about your ... relationship with my ... been so long\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both\nBoth and very powerful position with Christian or who reportedly convinced Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to ah Canada or Mexico first ah and he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\n... it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this\nBut President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide\nUh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Christian or a and that continued as president and so a big part of criminals portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared Nevada that there is such a genius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... and about Trump or but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not\nHappy with questionnaires are influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy where the White House is getting daily questions about it and the secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the ...\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion or was one of the White House official who is reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter could show gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials oppressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent uh but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticism\nTheir investigation is open and transparent\nA but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of the disappearance of one of the criticisms of course there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for a foreign leader to manipulate him I talked to Brent brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that cushion or could act as a back channel\nTo Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security chain\nAmong there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family trauma and the Saudis\nAnd a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that is not clear\nAnd some of the dealings are are not transparent up but we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports\nAre that Kushner a Christian or a backed or associate it a firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a lot thank you you're listening to all things considered\nThis is Sharon Smith with the USDA marketing service and dodge city Kansas the

wave\nThere's also potential for a rainbow wave a record number of openly L G ... people are on the ballot at least two hundred forty four according to the victory fund a bipartisan group that tracks and supports clear candidates today we're going to talk with three of them a\nMillion mark has is a Democrat in Montana she is running for the state legislature and the buildings area and she would be the first openly transgender person ever elected in Montana welcome Amelia Hi\nGina Ortiz Jones is a Democrat in Texas running for Congress and the twenty third district which has the largest stretch of U.S Mexico border she could be the first openly gay woman\nEver elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us thank you and Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of the New Hampshire state Senate\nThanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae to people to run for office\nYou know I think what we're seeing is that as we have broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think frankly I don't know that that at first but it it continued to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an allergy to be the woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry I water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your age your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name of ... it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not yeah\nI Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government\nUm we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballads that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities um and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou get the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five Gina you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relate to\nAnd Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia ... twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae ... people do think that shapes your experience yeah\nThis is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellow than and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I said don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I Would like to thank folks that like you and Dan paved the way it says a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world look like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent uh [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard to murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks at my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nTerm process the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidate fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting to hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... T. Q. community stepped up and wants to run for office kind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people\nAnd we have all the overall national landscape for future LDP keep candidates as well\nGina yet I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know that there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it's\nNo but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what Amelia discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think it's less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYeah one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene Amelia do as well\nTo those young people that are following behind us [noise] I Want to thank\nAll three of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and the million Marquez is running for state legislature in Montana it was great talking with all of you pleasure pleasure to speak with all of you as well [noise]\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nSupport for all things considered is made possible in part by chamber music Amarillo present in classical concert Bush well Kraft piano trio featuring works by Schubert and for Saturday November third at eight PM at the Fibonacci she M.

be in office and his administration will still be active in trying to find places to roll back harmful rag\nBut Democrats might be able to put the brakes on some of those efforts if they win a

person since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both\nBoth in very powerful position it was Christian or who reportedly convinced Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first foreign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to ah Canada or Mexico first\nUh and he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle Middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel and Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he

and for a foreign leader to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel\nOut to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security change\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes
