Cornish three more suspicious packages were discovered today one in New York for actor Robert Deniro into in Delaware for former vice president Joe Biden\nAnd make the total of ten packages sent this week to prominent critics of President Trump along with CNN [noise]\nThe big question of course in who sent them the head of the ... of the FBI New York office William Sweeney gave an update on the investigation to reporters today\nThe FBI will continue to focus all of the resources at our disposal to identify and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible for these acts\nNPR's Hansi Lo Wang reporting on the investigation from New York City and ... where does the investigation stand at this point into these packages\nOr you have a really a full force of law enforcement trying to figure out why this happened who was behind this or this includes the FBI then my P. D. also the secret service and as you mentioned there are ten packages are found in New York Florida Delaware California, Maryland this is really sprawling\nAnd law enforcement of trying to put together all these different pieces that they've collected from the packages there either all center on their way to FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia and they're trying to really look at the details here trying to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the powder that was found in the package that was sent to CNN the New York all of his\nUh uh the eyes Williams Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe powder in those particular ... did not present a biological for other announcers is ongoing however it is worth repeating any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices that quote suspected explosive devices or else imbedded away any questions that possibly any of these\nYou know explosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intense they're focusing in the investigation or asking for tips from the public\nOr there's been sedate threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now\nWell one big question is where these package that sent through the postal system or some of them could they have been delivered by courier\nAnd also what were the materials used for these explosive devices I spoke with a former ATF agents out from the bureau of alcohol um [noise] uh firearms a division and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures that may be able to identify who who was the individual or individuals behind this\nAlso they're looking at a closed circuit TV footage to see if they have any indication of who may be involved and you really can't rule out that there may be more packages out there and so that's something that a postal workers and law enforcement or on the lookout for\nThat's Mitch Robinson with this line of community economic development organization he

from Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck hit her time at the network and seen some controversy including comments she made about black face\nAnd twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck hit her time at the network and seen some controversy including comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nShall I making tally and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment\nBy NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David chaotic so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our stage show she was having a chat a couple of days ago with a several panelists about Halloween costumes and talks about how she's not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different rate here's what she had to say\n[laughter] you get in trouble if you are a white person who was like on the wane or black or white like I Can't that was okay as long as you were trying to buy a character\nAnd that of course that tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by whites\nHow did her fell NBC college react to all this\nPretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story or both by a on the NBC nightly news\nUh obviously it anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show a tour for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from our broker a he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShe owes a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin perhaps the newest co hosted today show he weighed in as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run among um that's silly and juniors and it it's it's just as ignorant and resistance statement itself\nAh NBC News Germany Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject of pizza defenders well\nThis isn't the first time making Kelly of tastes criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\n[noise] well I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host much sharper edge Fox News host she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ were white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show is been\nAiling a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executive that she had really embrace at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who were teens is tied to the network what have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction in and a welcome from a employees that NBC she displaced a couple of a popular figures in that town hall and a ... a at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in addition she was paid an extraordinary amount of money or for a uh for the thing\nFor a at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in addition she was paid an extraordinary amount of money or for ah ah for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nMegan Kelly comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear and um we do every year old who was in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface Avon and now the advent housing is like the Christmas it all coming in from the one day of the year when all the risks as costuming comes out maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether blackface is bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well\nWalk us through some of the history of this when did we first started saying blackface and America\nWe first start thing by faith in the early Eighteen hundreds on may become central to mental shows which why people would dress up like by people I talk in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missile shows depicted black people as lazy as animal lipstick playoff caricatures played the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad the human condition that allowed labor to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger and the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ...\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black face [noise]\n\n[noise]\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow fever betrayal of Asian American the right of Mickey Rooney character and breakfast at Tiffany's um but it does mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy ... against\nUs and to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nOne of the people who are caffeine caricatured often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missiles who are not wearing black with because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\nTo track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about the ... ...\nWhat do you make of that [noise]\n[noise] I mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of that history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly what you were talking about that and the panel that all white and I went to the port and\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocent people who may dress up and black face and that happens all the time and have conversations about race in history in power they always become conversations about intent and not about sort of brought a constantly always start in a store vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're the good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so many controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there's not a black person independence and no one at that party made bad an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and men that video had to contend with a different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that\nTen with a different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery as well maybe in your conversation will be better served if you spent less time parts and go what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people were not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team than kitchen thank\nYou so much for Louisiana with over [laughter] I Hope not [noise]\nThis is NPR News\n[noise]\nTune in on Saturday afternoons for in a cubicle age this singer songwriters American is full in just down\nHas threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us lead to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping there\nTo close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the u._s. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and shouldn't do Neal you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump was threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nAnd so actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern trying all nations that goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs\nHelping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violent or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear your regular basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nTo leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of the alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at the radios right now and ... to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs from Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here you know each country\nIn the end should be responsible for their problems in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problem of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThan we need to be active around the world and these are places in our hemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize places to make them safer and so we should be looking here nearer to home\nFor places that do affect a day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking\nSeveral hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is the the us has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nTo Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just the AIDS the United states with a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now ... national and nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here\nIn our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages are not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them that\nI Would tell the president to double down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce file and improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these government accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for\nProvide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these government accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and in fact alongside the United states because it's in the end it is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people Shannon O'Neill of the council on Foreign Relations thanks so much my pleasure [noise]\n\nYou're

Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts it seems like today it catches up on where the investigation stands\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating tens that's fishes packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump\nMay include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned an actor and prominent Trump credit Robert De Niro had received one of the packages ... at an address link to him in New York another common denominator is that these all our people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded a air had the potential to explode coming here ... are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official as part of that review was already under way they're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI is assistant director William Sweeney said that powder and at least some of these on bulbs does not appear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives who was reviewed them images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people and intimidate them\nAnd there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people and intimidate them and did that without happening\nFor political or personal reasons all of that in a big focus of this is All right so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect it at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know\nPolls credibility interval was plus

Mexico border the combination and sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond and become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms were going to dig into this with\nWisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system and then she was partly because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico and the so called caravan makes its way north\nMexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I I I Know what I'd call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a couple of children and I was failing units incentivized by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I Tour de the northern frog countries with them southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before SRAs special interest aliens when we were about ... back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nI'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truth boy it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds is opposed we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I\nI'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute\nOf course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I got I\nI Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with you a president\nDo not have any specific evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect checkup a second claim with you a President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan like let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of it it's a lot of people say I wonder who started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support the Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change laws so we can end these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from the ask you the direct question that has on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this a curtain Honduras or people opposed to a prison ... down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what ever read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of our products driven homeland security most of these\nLaws aren't under my major's diction we've gotta do to my Comey's jurisdiction because there's this year I was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I can start handling this so I tried to go through this\nAs a business person would a problem solver gather information find the IRS agreement in our community we you know we all want to secure the border that we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained that we want enforce our laws and we don't separate families do try to go through problem solving process\nVery transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect of this and then maybe successful breeds success\nSenator thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin\nMany of the migrants now traveling north originated in Honduras and journeys like that happen every year but this group is far larger than most and its fields competing narratives about how it was organized\nNPR's Carrie Kahn reports many of the migrants said they heard about it on TV and social media and jumped at the chance to flee and the safety of numbers\nThirty four year old ... Vasquez sister was seven kids between them stop to grab some free coffee and bread and that by local residents in southern Mexico\nAnd they've been walking for days they heard about the hundreds leaving Honduras via social media last week and grabbed a bus catching up with a caravan right before cross into Guatemala\nMeaning that I mean I think\nWe've been waiting months to join up with a cat and leaving ... Vasquez said she wanted to flee Honduras after her husband was exploded and killed by gang members she says there was no way she could pay a smuggler thousands of dollars and when she got attacks on WhatsApp describing the size of this one it seemed the safest way to go\nTalking to migrants on the track north you hear similar stories early in October flyers began circulating in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula the march north would leave from the city's central station\nPopular\nCable station age the age went live on the bus station showing hundreds already lining up by telephone\nMaybe not being a cable station agency age went live on the bus station showing hundreds already lining up by tell if one day the former legislator and human rights activist who put the original posters up says the TV shots were the best publicity\nLog on and on your [laughter]\nI never never imagined so many people would joined the caravan and that it will grow into the ... days the president tacked on duress has accused ... days have receiving funds from Venezuela other officials have said Fuentes is using the migrants to score political points back home he denies all those claims\n... or ... in the river than they used as a matter of fact or is it I mean yeah\nYou just have to spend Fifteen minutes with these people and you know why they're fleeing he says read also passed or compost is a spokesman for hundreds his main opposition party Labour Day saying that\nBehind the hairs on our radical political interests are leftist and criminal interests is grotesque and absurd\nHe says it's easier for the current government to blame the migrants than provide needed job safety and freedom of political expression calls to the Honduran president's spokesman were not answered and an interview request to the hunger an ambassador Mexico was declined Carrie Kahn NPR News Mexico City\n[noise]\nThis is NPR News\nHere at age ...

farmers aren't a monolith but they generally fall into one of two categories those who want to start small local inorganic operations\nOr those who want to stay in the family business and grow conventional crops like corn and soybeans like John heating he's twenty six and self corn and soybean seed outside to law in Illinois\nHe invited me in her house slash on it\nBut what he really wants to do is farmers own land\nYou know we're all my family farm is where I grew up with what I Love justice his father and grandfather did he was looking for land to rent from retiring farmers but farmers are hanging on longer and farms continue to be consolidated so there are fewer opportunities\nOne angle heating has tried is a database in Iowa called ag link that connects tenured farmers with the getting one's potentially to buy or rent land David Baker runs ag link and he encourages beginning farmers to think of renting first\nLand is by far the the last thing I Want to see them try

Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now that subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear when we do every year unquote which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface Avon and not all the way the advent Halloween is likely Christmas at all companies on that one day of the year when all the reaches costume and comes out and maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well\nWalk us through some of the history of this when did we first started saying black face in America\nWe first start things like these in the early Eighteen hundreds or may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like black people are talking in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course he's mental shows depicted black people with lazy as animal lipstick play caricatures played the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad humidity shouldn't allow slavery that happened at the time and so these characters linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twentieth century ...\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black [noise]\n\n[noise]\nSo there's a whole three of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow face betrayal of Asian Americans think of Mickey Rooney is character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that\nAll of Asian American pie or anything of Mickey Rooney is character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy against\nThat and to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nOne of the people who are caffeine caricatured often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and Michel ... who are not wearing black with because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\n... [noise] to track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about the history ...\nWhat do you make of that [noise]\nI mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of that history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly what you were talking about this and the pedal this all white and I went to the port and\nShe's going to be primarily concerned with defending the innocent people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time and have conversations about race in history in power they always become conversations about intent and not about sort of brought a contact we always start in a store or backing\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nSo I'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the concept of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when you controversy tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party dressed in blackface usually there is not a black person and attendance and no one at that party me about an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party flipped out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and then that video have to contend with\nA different context with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery and so maybe in your conversation\nWill be better served if we let time parts and go what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people were not when they put on black base\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team ...\nThank you so much for Louisiana quit sober [laughter] I felt [noise]\nThis is NPR News [noise]\nHave played with some high plains public radio and we are at\nHands of Morial debate in Garden City\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nThis is Angie ...
