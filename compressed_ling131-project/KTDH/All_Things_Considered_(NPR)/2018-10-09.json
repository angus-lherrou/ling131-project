working on just last night he\nWas back at Florida State in Tallahassee where he went to college to talk with courage students and well Bolden hey there\nHow are you doing I'm All right how are you holding up down there I guess the hurricane mornings didn't uh didn't to interrupt the proceeding down there\nNot just being from Florida John ... a ... year old\nSon let me ask you what was your pitch to students last night how do you get young people to come out to vote what do you say\nWell a friend first of all you have to let them know that number one their vote counts um if you have to let them know that they have to be concerned about oh more than just the sport that basically\nWe all athletes that you were talking to\nYou have to ... it was oh after we okay I'm a I think it's important for Applebee's use their platform and in the right word but more so than just getting out of all I think you have to be knowledgeable about what you're voting for\nA lot of the time the state and local elections that are sometimes even more important than your presidential elections because those elections that really affects you ate today like\nWell I Hope everybody staying safe down there\nNow you have been active across a bunch of friends those the op ed that that you co wrote over the summer along with several other pro football players or this was urging President Trump to use his clemency power to try to make a dent in the federal\nPrison population which leads me to ask a fairly basic question that but what does things like getting out the right to vote or presidential pardon power half to do with football I mean why do we need to hear from from the NFL on these issues\nWell I I don't think it's so much of hearing from an eye for but I Do want to hear from the players who aren't everyday citizens just because we're Applebee's does it mean that we are not affected by the law of the land doesn't mean that our family members are affected by what's going on\nThere been a number of very high profile other athlete activists also fighting social injustice but doing it in a different way from you I'm thinking of Colin Kaepernick thinking of Eric

speak out which in turn led to the downfall of many leaders in business and in the media including here at NPR\nThe string of high profile allegations and the me too movement that came out of it transformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace sexual harassment laws the key provisions take effect today as NPR's Yuki

are aware of the new laws are scrambling\nI'm really trying to think of a part of it that they're not struggling with the ... point\nKenya estimates over half of the state small firms likely aren't aware they're subject to these rules to be affected he's as prevention training can't be a simple check the box exercise the New York law requires more than just sitting employees in front of an online video\nThe printing yes to some comedy questions including low trainer made available during the training session to answer those questions\nAnd then requires feedback from employees about the training and the materials presented\nMany small businesses may lack the resources to pull this off employers large enough to have a human resources person usually have policies and procedures already

face consequences if they don't follow through\nIf they don't the state can certainly audit them or investigate them and very often the way that happens is if an employer is not doing as an employee
