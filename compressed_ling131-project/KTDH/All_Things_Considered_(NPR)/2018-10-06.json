final vote and he's with us now from Capitol Hill it's got welcome thanks for joining a famous show so first of all set the scene for us for people who are not able to watch it you know these votes are one of the most formal moments that ever happened in the Senate\nSenator sit at their desk and vote one by one while the vice president presides so ads that what's happening person after person in

survivor that he's putting his personal politics ahead of her experience that happened over and over again another man yelled at Jeff Flake that he was a coward and all Thirteen people were removed from the gallery during the vote\nAnd I think that sums up this whole story in one scene that Senate struggling with its formal responsibilities amid hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis\nThat has all been so partisan and divisive um but even accounting for the theatrics county that people sometimes bring to politics gets you have a sense of his anger will linger in the Senate\nI think so or senators from both parties are incredibly angry for very different reasons and just listen to some of today's concluding speeches Mazie Hirono Democrat from Hawaii says this is another case of a woman being ignored\nThat's what I I'm left with Mr President anger Harry this guy\nThat could not see the truth of what Dr for I tried

the judge and his family and disappointed than their lack of any empathy or more for what they have put them through\nWell let's talk about that for a minute let's talk about the Republican view for him and it's got tickets because many senators have said all along that they've found Christine positive for sincere incredible and yet they effectively discounted their testimony that they talk\nAbout that they did Republican after Republican was making that same argument often in in strikingly similar wording almost the exact same phrasing that Ford was sincere that's a word that kept

probably heard by now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you would likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and support to judge Kavanaugh\nNow we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford the woman who told the Senate Judiciary committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago when I spoke with its banks yesterday I asked whether Ford a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they had been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country has tremendous I'm not certain she has a sense of that yet the the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but\nBut certainly what she has done a has unleashed something that it's going to move the country in a better direction and women across the country across the world for that matter\nOr have found their voice to come forward to have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... ... what does professor Ford want to happen now which makes you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her ... shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and it is now that the information be provided to the people making the decision to that those making this decision could make an informed\nDecision with all the facts that happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAnd the FBI investigations are typically conducted\nThey did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect\nOn both parties I made it there is some evidence that Republicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that\n[noise] I think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and\nThis is going to be an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has\nRaised a lot of passion and concern among the American people and it's a debate we're gonna continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat relates a bank one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\n'em\nThis week Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting on November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nIt's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but as a new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the

bonuses and some stock benefit we just got a check in with an Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thoughts\nMy name is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old\nI work at ... Indiana at at Amazon so on a day to day basis I Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match up physically and virtually so I've been at this a film at center since it opened up

five\nAn hour all it is concerning us mainly is were given a monthly bonus and when our holiday season comes around that bonus essentially doubles and we're worried about not getting or pay out and making less\nMy name's falls to Martinez had been working for the last three weeks I worked in the ... century Miami I started working in the store\nIs approaching the gun from him but you received a merchandise [noise] to bring the inventory for making them and others for hours and no one would be treated as we're going to be made for using dollars an hour after November first\nHow you feel very excited about it because of their provider I didn't know it can be used to my farm in a better quality ... more time with my family because I don't have to be looking for full time job is going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work out which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will all to start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of the employees that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho are doing a raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with them you could hear that some were very excited about it but\nOthers were concerned about their bonuses and particularly during the holiday season now you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal\nRight so there have been a few reports and a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses and the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that some employees would get vested in to the company and they would get\nThat big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the company said\nPretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options on the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated the company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making\nIt's a little bit more complicated the company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money with this Fifteen dollar minimum wage then you were before\nSo I think part of the confusion might arise from the fact that the wage increase and the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees didn't know that it was coming any idea why\nWhy why did they announce it so suddenly and why no\nOne is kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company on Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that the conversation at the top level what's happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been at state of stories are highlighting some of the more um questionable activity that some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere was that big a criticism that Amazon got when the company released their median income number\nThe median income was released at twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars this is just above poverty level for a family of four\nOn radio players will be there with our new music director Mike Elizondo and our new team with

there's been a verdict in the trial of former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke he was found guilty last evening on second degree murder and other charges for killing Seventeen year old Laquan McDonald back in October two thousand fourteen\nMore than a year later dash cam video sparked large protest what it showed the officer shooting McDonald's sixteen times bend I testified that he felt threatened by McDonald\nA podcast called sixteen shots from member station WBFO easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune have been following the trial it's included riveting conversations with people from all walks of life or connected to the story including with officer Van Dyke and there was tape from the courtroom when the jury returned to\n... we find as guilty of that we find and I do

she might welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you\nHost of the podcast sixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again she might welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you so let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nTheir reaction was one I think of overwhelming relief um there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trials especially activists who believed Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also this sense that this is just one case you know in in the seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting with climate Donald fatally CPT shut nearly four hundred people\nAnd all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's a sense that this is one officer one case but that's not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and are the people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really that's where the problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given\nSo that's the overwhelming sentiment um but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWell would you tell some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologists the defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with Van Dyke\nOr the officers said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect of we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy is not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in the pockets of reporting on the fact that it's opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or don't just keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abuse of\nPolicing practices or after the video which leads to the shooting\nThe department of justice came in and and investigated CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy in practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police perform again they say this is one case that we think to some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what is reform looked like\nYou know what is it going to look like moving forward it's consent decree in the city is in the process of enacting a consent decree to reform the police department but isn't going to be effective because there have been promised us in the past\nThat the police department was going to be reformed there have been different handled for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that it's worked so what's going to happen from here [noise]\nShe's the host of sixteen shots such a podcast\nAnd I'm all for their actions and none of that it's worked so what's gonna happen from here\nIn
