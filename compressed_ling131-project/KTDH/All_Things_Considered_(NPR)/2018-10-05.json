for decades or one of the two reporters who broke that Weinstein story was Jodi Kantor and she joins me now hey there\nHi how are you I'm well thank you I started here you just pointed out today a picture of what you were up to a year ago today and it's it's a bunch of you all crowded around to the computer and the New York Times' newsroom about to hit send on the Weinstein story on your right none of us knew what was going to happen when we took that out into the world\nWe didn't my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because of the times when doing bigger investigations sexual harassment me knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly and we were reporting on Fort factory workers\nBut you never know what's gonna happen to an investigation what it's when it's published and you know one of our editors I'm Matt party\nLike to say as we were working on it he said hurting winds dean is not that famous and that is true aside from New York and LA and maybe D.C he really was not a household name 'em and and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which was founded years ago by trying to bark\nTakeoff globally but it just kept going and going\nAnd going there were so many times in the past year when I saw productions that that's going to burn out or you know the women were ... down or the news it's finally going to stop and it never did and what's happening with judge Kavanaugh I think is representative of that there's a feeling that this reckoning only continues\nAnd grows bigger let me ask you this if if Kavanaugh is confirmed a with a full Senate vote this weekend [noise] do you see that as a step back to the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which probably have some validity I'll give you the ... the obvious one is that people will say this as a setback even confirmed anyway\nUh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter\nUm women were\n... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of any of the hell\nThe other argument however is that\nWhat especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country she put high school on the table\nRight she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the president and we also are moments like

the same side I think it's a reminder scale I think it's a reminder at the global reach that and also media reminder perspective at a moment when we're all so immersed in the ... needed me to this as a reminder that this topic is is even bigger than that in a way\n[noise] Jodi Kantor she broke the Harvey Weinstein story for the New York times one year ago today ... thank you thank you so much [noise]\nDo you think this effect that kind of dynamic\nIt could and that is what concerns people the relationship between for example Antonin Scalia the anchor of the conservative wing and\nRuth Bader Ginsburg are very different justice and yet\nQuite close friends who would spend every New Year's eve together and go to operas together and so on\nThat kind of college geology is stressed when you have a candidate who comes to board with a background of this sort of a confirmation process it's not that the court can't deal with it but it will make the court more visible doesn't mean they have to come out from underneath always rubs doesn't mean that suddenly we're going to have CSPAN or that they're going to stop their\nVery small group conferences but it does mean that for many

acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different\nWell I think the number of shot six moon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were

NPR News Washington\nBack in July when Kavanaugh was named as the nominee among the people gathered at the White House for the big announcement with John Malcolm Malcolm is with the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank here in Washington\nThink tank which President Trump has credited with helping to inform his thinking on judicial nominees John Malcolm joins me now welcome it's a pleasure to be with you and my right in thinking you're pleased with how the confirmation vote appears to be shaping up\nYes I'll be more pleased after it's done tomorrow now Korea likely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate Chuck I'm Supreme Court and I'm very pleased about\nThe numbers are there I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and short typically questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho we didn't last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nThe thing that the rule judge and they should have been in for a when he was nominated\nJoni Mitchell typically questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens but former Supreme Court justice\nWho we didn't last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the road and they should have been here for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings draws me to change my mind\nJoe Malcolm so these are not he said she said questions that are being right these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to a bar who knew\nHim well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him and his reputation as family that he would have acted like and what time is on\nI had by the way he acted like an atomic time I think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that by Kavanaugh was put into a position\nWhere he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right they let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clinton that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice while I foreign\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal bullies and he is not about to sacrifice that wealth is a reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the ... you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut did that specific remarketing or he went on to say that the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that away because he's mad that Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what Thanksgiving should he not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after our break he apologized to center ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the collar but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's drinks and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will ...\nAnd he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there's some things they shouldn't have said what things should not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually going to hearing so for instance when he came back after our break he apologized to center ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the collar but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's drink sorting gang rape\nIf that will not get one right just the ... that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\n[laughter] you know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for a maximum advantage and had a political edge to it and I I not fault him for responding to that you will not affect what kind of a justice he will be

of what you were up to a year ago today and it's it's a bunch of you all crowded around to the computer and the New York Times' newsroom about to hit send on the Weinstein story and you write and none of us knew what was going to happen when we took that out into the world we\nDidn't my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of a story as we were recording it and because of the times with doing bigger investigations sexual harassment me knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we're we're reporting on Bill O'Reilly and we were reporting on

hurting wine skiing is not that famous and that is true aside from New York and LA and maybe D.C he really was not a household name 'em\nAnd and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which was founded years ago by trying to park\nTakeoff globally but it just kept going and going\nAnd going there were so many times in the past year when I saw productions that this was going to\nBurn out or you know the women were authentic simmered down or the news was finally going to stop and it never did and what's happening with judge Kavanaugh I think is representative of that there's a feeling that this reckoning only continue engrossed Becker let me ask you this it if Kavanaugh is confirmed a with a full Senate vote\nThis weekend [noise] do you see that as a step back to the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for the me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which probably have some validity I'll give you the pro and con the obvious one is that people will say that the fed back he was confirmed anyway\nUh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter\nUm women were\n... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of any to hell\nThe other argument however is that\nWhat especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country she put high school on the table\nRight she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the president and we also
