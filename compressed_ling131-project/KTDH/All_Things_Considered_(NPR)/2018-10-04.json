I mean here's here's my big question which is what to these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and hacks against democratic ah servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterm from further Russian interference videotape wouldn't touch that question\nToday but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which makes the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again and one unusual things stood out this morning the DOT actually had a warning for news media\nThey added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nIn one unusual things stood out this morning that the O.

call it the genius grant for years experts have thought the earth's moon formed after a large collusion knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet like earth is mostly rock vapor\nWhat does rocket vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes the gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nCame from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry at the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculation that we had done and realizing that owns the assumptions are actually violated\nBy what we're looking at I think in any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] so of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the published paper with for years so I think we had a lot of internal debates\nA amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the men\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the men was the last major event in the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today\nUnderstanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to the final event and creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely how did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation and in the process I learned that collisions were the major physical prowess\n...

of people were leaving the city and grow\nIn the eighties New York city had been hard hit by a recession then the crack and HIV epidemics there was a part of rounds so that was totally abandoned the other side of do mocked\nThe New York city government sold over sixteen square blocks of Brownsville to the east Brooklyn congregations for one dollar\nThose blocks were dilapidated run down the city agreed to build infrastructure and provide cash subsidies for over a thousand affordable homes they would start selling at thirty thousand dollars each they were called Nehemiah houses after the men

through regional national\nHe'll say we reflect on the political consequences of this controversy were about a month out from the terms yesterday we heard about this NPR Marist Poll signed the Republican enthusiasm had jumped over the last month perhaps because of Kavanaugh do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats it's great they're fighting a battle ground in the suburbs and they are eagerly courting women there and this has energized them the Senate battleground on the other hand is in states that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd that's a much harder situation for Democrats up for re election in those states so far only one Democrat in front of that group is something we haven't heard from that Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd today Heidi Heitkamp said she was a no and this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I've made that decision\nHolder showing her down and this might be the thing that she needs to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat and this is a state of North Dakota right that's right and I mean from a lot of Democrats that that thinks Republican enthusiasm may said if you have an gets confirmed so we'll see we'll see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks I'm watching\nYou well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges pass to have stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat when Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive that he wants all Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone they did then told me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former run this had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony unit that took up most of the three thousand the characters bases a bill out\nSo you filled out the form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nAllows I did not I was never called buck a way to buy my phone on my computer ah hoping to get an email or nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is a central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI what do they need to question you\nKnow I think it's relevant because first of all the other one should learn from the view so usually a committee or what is taking the oath and one is also trying out in this case it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nIt's a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony desperate in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black now I think ... confused that was passing out but the blackmailed phrase means doing things that you don't know you you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nThey let me let me ask you that's a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is that that represent a complete a thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about making eighty three eighty four eighty five at college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so

plot in April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passport traveled to the Hague and rented a car and then fill it with electronic equipment they parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons\nThe goal was to penetrate the wife fi networks there but the Dutch we're on to them so the men abandoned the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the O P cw was examining substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. this year since ... exactly\nI mean here's here's my big

that question today but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which makes the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nAnd one unusual things stood out this morning the DOT actually had a warning for

simulate those massive impact here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis\n\nHer work earned her a spot in this year's class of MacArthur fellows many of us call it the genius grant for years experts of thought the earth's moon formed after a large collision knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet like earth is mostly rock vapor\nWhat does rocket vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes the gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that are men grows within the rock paper of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock paper of the earth and that gives them in the same chemistry and the her\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust to themselves and maybe women even more than men\nI think in any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] so of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves\nFirst how long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the published paper with for years so I think we had a lot of internal debates a amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the men\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the men was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today\nUnderstanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to the final event and its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely\nHow did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation and in the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've kind of kid who was always going in the backyard staring at the stars\n[noise] I had my nose in books imagining space travel I very much enjoyed science fiction\nSo for you is studying plan up to fall back to actually traveling through space\nI might be too terrified to actually go up in space [laughter] exploration and our imagination and through the laws of physics has been exciting enough for me\n[noise] serious Stewart is a planetary scientist at the University of California Davis and two days she was named to the new class of

questions she began asking as a young woman working inside her father a third generation high plains farmer questions like how to make a living well also stew hurting the land and water beneath our feet and\n\nElephant born cash cow [noise]\nFew years ago I attended a meeting in my hometown good Lynn Kansas it had been called by the vision team appointees of then governor Sam Brownback who had taken a noteworthy interest in conserving the Ogallala Aquifer\nWe hundred or more attendees were divided into groups of around eight each and asked to address a series of questions for instance what role might technology play in conserving the aquifer and how could education about the aquifer be improved\nBut the question that stands out in my memory I simply how long should the water last I was struck by the earnest and ...\nProved but the question that stands out in my memory asked simply how long should the water last I was struck by the earnest and heartfelt response is that the farmers at my table\nThe water should last for generations one man said forever set another these wishful aspirations were met with foreign ... nods no one said as many farmers had in news stories I'd read over the years\nThat the water was there to use as they pleased and leaving it in the ground wouldn't do anyone any good\nI guess that enough water had passed under the bridge or through irrigation pipes for them to realize that a crisis was truly up on them several worried that unless they took serious measures now the water would soon be gone and their children and grandchildren wouldn't be able to profit from the land is they had\nAll their new seed varieties and technologies did make it possible to use less water the farmers readily admitted that these with all my slow the aquifers decline\nI kept waiting for someone to mention the elephant in the room but since no one did I guess it was up to me\nHeart Tom Payne I said that the federal government was driving the aquifers depletion with the ethanol mandate\nAnd by subsidizing crop insurance for corn the crop grown most widely on irrigated acres don't you think that the mandate should be ended I asked and the government should pay you instead to retire your water rise or at the very least grow more drought tolerant crops\nCorn is very water efficient one farmer proclaimed the nods around the table this time were insistent and affirming but I had filed my father's irrigation reports with the Kansas water office for over Twenty years and I had done the math\nWe had used on average Nineteen hundred gallons of water per bushel of corn which amounted to more than twice the water that fell from this guy in a normal growing season in down markets government subsidies had been the only reason we had made money on the crop\nBut not one farmer at that table was willing to entertain changes in government corn policy\nEach of them did want the water to last forever they really did but they didn't want to give up their most profitable crop even if that was the only way to save it\nWho can blame them what else can be expected when the elephant in a room is also a cash cow\n[noise] [noise]\nMm\nYou lean there
