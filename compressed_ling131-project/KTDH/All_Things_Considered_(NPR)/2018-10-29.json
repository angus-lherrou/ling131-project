considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the defense department in sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nThat follows an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general parents a shot and see who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise said something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is it fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\n[noise] uh just goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing\nAnd the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role again no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first sill or they'll do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas creating more car bear a barrier is more razor wire fencing of crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agencies to more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called pasta come attaches which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nAnd well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah there were only to support role again and the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used in former Confederate States in that law prohibits military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not are going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay [laughter] the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sent in the past in again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who is doing everything again from constructing camps flying border patrol agents so you have engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven the lawyers in public affairs staff and uh again general are shown as he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the same number of troops now in Iraq and right and maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said a border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting up to speed on the latest developments

really took away from the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bowers the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign of rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter but when you have to have ... pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all those hey there hello so the White House it of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did with condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did would blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative\nOr even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country and she she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a standard is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent with who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back events happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play the role of the solar in chief\nKind of back to back events happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play the role of the ... solar in cheap or certainly not the night or in chief\nUh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is when something's happened he said something directly after the ... the tragedy uh that is expected\nUm but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign event where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any of these laws I Am more than she does and I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his supporters like we expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're battling taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences of being in the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nIt's very hard to tell A People's views of Trump are as seem to be pretty hard and at that point so you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes\nOr the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha

from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nThat follows an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general parents are ... who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom ... says something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right it's a fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\n[noise] uh just goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duties which was transportation aerial surveillance are kind of thing\nAnd the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities in these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role you know law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still do do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas ... a barrier is more razor wire fencing you're crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter does all to a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also builds camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law firm called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the u._s. that says that says all legit\nIt's become attached to its which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the u._s. that says that says all legit\nIt well ... that's with officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah there were only to support role again and the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the eighties seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not are going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay what's the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sits in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who are doing everything you'd get from constructing camps flying border patrol agents Soviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public affairs staff and uh again gentlemen showed us he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said a border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting us up to speed on the latest developments at the Pentagon thank you Tom\nYou're welcome in their quest to win back the house of

run the party chapter in Miami Dade ... that independent images\nAnd so he taught that taught that he's a moderate but when you see is voting rights act that is completely not the case and

sites included bringing flowers or planting some cutting back\nWeeds an unruly grasses sometimes we washed and polish the headstones usually stories were shared about family of course but also of neighbors and friends buried nearby sometimes we tended agreed that seemed neglected as if no one had visited in a while\nCertain holidays like Memorial Day Christmas and Easter I learned to count on a drive to two or more cemeteries one very small now probably overgrown and lost to most were great great grandparents were buried was more than a Ninety\nMinute drive looking back I'm not sure I felt consoles but I felt strength and from the time with family both past and present my uncle and making his final arrangements chose cremation the first in our family to do so his remaining Ken my sister me a cousin\nWe did finally decide to bury his remains in a family fought it being too difficult for us to imagine ourselves casting his\nAshes to the wind and not to finding them to a place we can return to\nAs I become a family elder of sorts myself I found this sitting family gravesites difficult to do\nAll my family to date have been buried and family plots not not many of the family I grew up with are buried in the same part of much less the same cemetery my parents divorced when I was in high school are buried in different\nStates one in Kansas the other in Colorado which means much like when they were living it's very difficult to visit them both\nOn holidays and it was also difficult for the usual reasons of time and money for me to be there with them as much as I wanted as they were dying others mostly family took on that responsibility\nAnd while I Know that my visiting and tending a grave site this little compensate for my absence says those rituals means something to me so I stop in when I can tidy up as needed stand in silent\nAnd I remember and I think on the passing of time\nI'm not sure I mentioned this yet but reading and talking about these books and the radio readers fall twenty Eighteen book series\nIt's really helped me move past some of my grief and guilt and loss for those for whom it feels that have been more present in their deaths than I was and they're dying I'm thinking too as I'm sure many of us are of what we can do to assure affordable equitable end of life care for all of our elders\nThank you H.
