considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin police violence and misconduct in the news again after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the killing of a teenager outlook on McDonald's\nBut regional events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot and Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shoot out what the subject\nOf violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers get up slightly over the past year\nAnd policing remains one of the country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more about that so we've contacted Maria haven't felt she is a professor of police science at John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me here what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing it's safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on uh from my perspective it's clearly what we should\nBut there's been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much as the number switch\nStatistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent it's significant that said that puts them but then when you look at the growing number we're talking about four to something off he says votes said this something offices\nSo from my perspective it's fairly well Dr they'll send a wide this police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what Dr phil fan there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know whether it's some turns that\nWe are saying let these dangerous and disturbing I Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina kids is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so it's kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case\nIf you look at the most amazing yes we're looking more at them but she is a police officer in meditation and we're looking at an investigative activity um when the handling you know persons with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations and on traffic stops I'm no longer the\nMost frequent reasons I'm for this\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of act doors as it if it were\nNot people who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police are though to oppress the police are biased a racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn general how the climate on in the last few years since ... on the police and United States so when when you put the two together the propensity towards\nViolent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus a triggering event then you have the the cuts us off the outcome so if somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the sea and the steps of the Supreme Court\nYou'd think police officers pushing back the demonstrators so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this ... this part of the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because you cannot take your and get out to get on a given police station instead you you're doing it against a preventative for the government with the police so\nBefore we conclude here bulls in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians often the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with the\n... when we looking both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are that part of the ... the activity if it is definitely a training issue office so frequently\nA sit in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that ah\nIt's always a reasonable thing to do given the as particular environment and given that said and political development that might be putting their lives and then just some this technical issues how you approach and the problem and how we are close to house\nA well you know that it's a ... who is armed and dangerous the problem is that we have Eighteen thousand police\nBut then how do you go to house a well you know that it's a ... who is armed and dangerous the problem is that we have Eighteen thousand police agencies and when you have a thing sounded police agency you cannot Institute stunned that for ... for training which would help I\nMean the the negative and of of policing as a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there is also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable\nThat nine outfits that one yeah are are killed in that line of duty as an outcome move to meditate activity that was directed against them explicitly another democratic society should accept to nine police officer in one yeah in separate incidents killed by members of the topic ... can accept\nThat as Maria haven't felt she the professor in the department of la police science and criminal justice administration at
