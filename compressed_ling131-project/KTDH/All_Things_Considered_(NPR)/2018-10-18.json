news reports many Latinos in taxes are cynical about politics\nIn fact according to a recent survey by jolt Texas almost forty percent of Texas Hispanics said they lacked confidence or trust in the political process more than one in four said they don't identify with particular political candidates and the third said they don't consider voting to be a civic duty\nGold founder and director Christina Simpson said Latino in that state haven't mobilized because they don't realize just how much power they wield at the polls\nQuote everyone asks how do we get Latinos out to vote since unexplained it's actually pretty simple you spend money on registering them you spend time with them and you speak to the issues they care about\nFor high plains public radio I'm Jonathan Baker\n\nSupport comes from I teach the great plains modernizing today's transmission infrastructure to connect consumers to their twenty first century needs more at I teach the dash holding dot com\nAnd we don't know who's going to be angrier white working class voters especially men that's the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually lose his big when the president is under fifty percent\nDemocrats know that the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably in midterms they're worried about motivating low propensity voters like Hispanics and young people\nOh All right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson thanks Mara thank you [laughter]\nNow for all the focus on how the Democratic party is shifting to the left nationally\nIf Democrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district it is a deep red and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat McAdams\nOr in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year of deep partisan splits almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump how do you view of the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise] you know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticized the Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends\nBut he is a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator knows that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in that district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress that I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump me a love for two term congresswoman\nWho got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican love is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly why I'm working with I build\nRelationships on both sides of the aisle love is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is also quick to point out that in several high profile moments he's criticized\nFor hall and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act she's also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump\nMost notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegate said that it stood up to the president when he has done something wrong\nAnd it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judge based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAt the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that despite the fact macadam says he would not vote for below sea to be speaker\nNow my opponent maybe not even say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there she it turns out there and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams ... keep his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the house is because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams that many of the candidates and the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift they're calling for single payer health care or impeachment\nSo if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return a more moderate ships party dynamics especially if they're the ones responsible for Democrats winning back power got Detrow NPR News Salt Lake city [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News support comes from Amarillo company presenting concerto an F ... conducting and featuring

considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly to Mexico and the imminent arrival of thousands of Central American migrants traveling in a so called caravan from Honduras their ultimate destination the United states\nPresident Trump is tweeting his plans to cut aid to any country that helps the migrants he's also threatened to send the U.S military to shut down the southwest border if the caravan of ... stopped and the White House is considering reviving the family separation policy to discourage families from coming north\nOr for its part in Mexico has ramped up security along its southern border at says only migrants with valid paperwork will be allowed to enter Mexico\nReporter James Frederick is out there to Qunu ... border crossing between Guatemala and Mexico and he joins me now hey James Henry Louis to describe exactly where you are what you can see\nI Am on the bridge that connects Mexico in Guatemala it's above the river to devise these two countries are above me is a sign that said the end of any of those are messy further influence from Mexico but you can tell Mexican security forces are preparing because there are dozens of police in riot gear waiting here\nFor the imminent arrival of this caravan\nAbout five minutes down the bridge from where I'm walking is the central square\nOf police in riot gear waiting here for the imminent arrival of this caravan about five minutes down the bridge from where I'm walking is the central square where three to four hundred members of the migrant caravan are waiting for the rest to arrive\nWho are these migrants where they coming from why are they coming\nSo most of the migrants that I spoke to her from ... uh but also summer from El Salvador in Guatemala let's listen to Judy uh thirty four year old I spoke to in that central square as she was cradling her exhausted five year old son on her lap\nOn that as a family thing and that they didn't say what do you do what she said is that there's no safety no job no medicine and hospitals she also went on to say that in hunter\nIt feels like freedom of assembly an expression or being repressed by the government of President Juan Orlando Edmund that she said it's just unlivable and Honduras for her right now some site violence is the main factor some type poverty but the people that I met are just absolutely desperate\nHas she or anybody else actually tried to cross onto the Mexican side of the border you\nKnow they are pretty dead set on crossing as a group and being a big visible force that tries to cross so they see strength and visibility in numbers\nNow I mentioned the Mexican position they're saying that only migrants with valid paperwork or going to be allowed to cross into Mexico what counts as valid paperwork in this
