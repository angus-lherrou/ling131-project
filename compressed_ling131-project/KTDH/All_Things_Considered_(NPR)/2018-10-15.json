Administration is being drawn ever more deeply into the mystery of Jamal ... fate showed you was laughing entering the Saudi consulate in and stumbled earlier this month [laughter]\nToday President Trump spoke to Saudi Arabia's king Solomon who says his country had nothing to do with ... disappearance Trump spoke to reporters about that conversation as he prepared to leave for a tour of areas hit by hurricane Michael\nYou didn't really know the [noise] I don't want to get by but it sounded to me like very good thing if you don't get it to the bottom of it as well as a flat denial\nWith me now to discuss this and the president's visit to Florida is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson Hi Mara Hi Mary Louise I'm real killers which is quite the turn of phrase do we know if the president has thought deeply on those to come up with it on the fly what\nWe're not sure about that but he certainly is offering an alternative theory of the case although he did not explain how road killers could have gotten into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and um\nKilled somebody in there but I think you see that his instinct is to deflect blame from the Saudi royal family he said several times that the king flatly denied it he firmly denied it and we've seen this pattern before when he took Latimer pollutants quote strong denials that Russia didn't interfere\nIn the twenty sixteen elections he even offered an alternative theory of the case back then when he said someone weighing four hundred pounds sitting on a bed might have hacked the Democrats emails so that's his instinct to basically\nTo protect defend dictators\nSo real killers is maybe the update on the four hundred pound guy yeah say okay and I mentioned the president was on his way to Florida Today I it's very common of course for president to visit a disaster area but in Florida a few weeks before an election what are the politics of a presidential visit\nWell this was an official visit but it definitely had a political component because two of the most important races the cycle or in Florida the governor's race of course very important to Trump that a Republican remain governor there for twenty twenty for Trump's own reelection\nAnd also the current governor Rick Scott is the Republican nominee for Senate and if Democrats can keep the Senate seat in Florida they probably have no chance of taking over the majority there\nBut the president did meet with Governor Rick Scott he praised him normally natural disasters are a very positive political opportunity for incumbent governors because they have the resources and executive powers that non incumbent slack they can be a\nBe that next caller from even has that new leather smell yeah it's really either [laughter] we

striking disparity in prisons across the United states women are disciplined more frequently and often more harshly than men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR and the ... school of journalism at northwest\nOur discipline more frequently and often more harshly than men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR ... school of journalism at Northwestern university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica papa that found that women are punished disproportionately from minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like a lot of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states in all but two women get that's when the higher rates than men what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison rolls at rates we estimated often two to three times higher for what prisons classify at smaller fraction\nPetty stuff you can get written up for a not closing your doors and get written up for jumping on the phone without permission or if you just want to just speak to your room or a knife in just takes and ... get written up for that\nThat's the tortilla Williams and it made up the central California women facility in show show a California you get\nWritten up for going out of bounds in somebody else's room are out of bounds in the hallway [noise] it's just basically everything you get written up for\nOur number showed that in California women compared to men get twice the disciplinary tickets for disobeying an order and more than twice as many for what's called disrespect\nIn Vermont we found women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called derogatory comments in Rhode Island they get more than three times the tickets for disobedience\nThose tickets have consequences women who's good combat credits the kind of time at it to their stay in prison or lose phoning visitation privileges or go to solitary confinement in Rhode Island women were more than three times as likely as men to end up in solitary confinement for disobedience\n[noise] prisons were built for men and the rules for discipline were set up to control those Matt ... says those rules don't\nWork very well with women you walk through a women's prison and it's a profoundly different experience we\nMet some of the day she was visiting Logan Correctional Center a women's prison in Illinois several years ago this was a top official in the Illinois department of corrections now she works with prison as a consultant she helps them address that problem of why women in prison get discipline more\nWomen are more can you ... when you walk to a prison there more emotional they want to talk to you they want to talk about their children that want to talk about their experiences\nTwo years ago they notice helped conduct an audit of that women's prison in Illinois and found that women prisoners were disciplined almost twice as often as men for all offenses big and small but almost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor insulin\nAnd they also really if they seen injustice with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix the problem\n... Toto says she likes it that women prisoners are this way but she said many corrections officers and often even in a women's prison most of them are men say they hate it\nAnd the first thing that they'll tell you is the the women are so difficult gosh they're a pain I Would rather work anywhere but here they always want to talk to you they won't take no for an answer\nCorrections officers are trained to keep control they expect women to be compliant if the women push back that's where the disciplinary tickets for influence come in\nTo women we met in Illinois total if they'd been written up some years ago for an infraction called reckless I bowling while women get more tickets than men certain women get the most tickets of all women with mental illness those were\nOne time she says she got in trouble for cursing at a guard when her soul mate who had diabetes passed out we thought the officer was too slow to help Williams says the hardest thing was when she lost her phone privileges and she couldn't call her son he was a baby when she went to prison and he was growing up without her\nAt work that because I'm ... years I\nI Would never occur to me that\nHe's nine now but Titanic Williams says that time separated often not even able to talk to him on the phone makes it hard to be a parent now\nEven today they acted out here with the consequences are are they said our dollar a year ago I it's it's hard though\nStill don't understand that there might not have been ... author and my family are heavy like current bickering you're gone\nMore than half of women in prison or the mothers of children under the age of Eighteen one common punishment that Illinois prison was that women last good conduct credits in one year alone twenty Fifteen women most Ninety three years of those credits that's twenty extra days or prison time for each woman\nThat's an average many women had no days added but some ended up with months even a year or more of extra time [noise]\nA small number of states including Illinois or trying to change that they're trying with called gender response of corrections practices\nIt's built around the idea that women are in prison for different reasons than men that they respond differently in prison and that prison rules need to recognize those differences in the U.S punitive\nGot him and found out that he had to\nHave that prison in Illinois a trainer at the front of a classroom tells corrections officers to think through the different pressures in a woman's life\nAnd she needs to see what's going on when they're signing his she just saying\nHow can we help her deal with this with\nPhone privileges revoked all she can do is write a letter home or to her son school\nIt's reminder to the corrections officers that tickets even ones for lesser offenses can have significant consequences reporter Jessica papa back meant officers that that training they didn't want to give their names they said the gender response of approach makes sense to them but that many of their co workers are much more skeptical\nI was money though I heard a lot of things but\nWhich has like hey I had been hacked worthless we're going to work as a hub of effect\nHas a thug method derogatory way of saying\nLetting the inmates run the prison we wrote letters to some of the women at that Illinois prison\nOne woman who wrote back said that since the training started she's not seen much difference she said corrections officers both men and the women are disrespectful and cruel\nAnd this is a quote there on a power trip they cause bitches hose they try to provoke you if you say anything back they send you that segregation for threats and intimidation\nThe number of women in prison is rising but still they're only about seven percent of the prison population nationwide so it's hard to get prison officials to make their problems are priority like the heavy punishment of women for those ... violations of prison rules Joseph

G\nI Trump suggested that it could have been the work of what he called rope killers and it doesn't make it easier for the king in crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to stick to their denials um this despite the fact that ... was last seen going into the Saudi consulate\nAnd if you say the president of the dispatch secretary ... talked with Saudi leaders and the search for the consulate today and it may be too soon to conclude this but these may be the kinds of movies you see when countries are trying to find a way out of this increasingly explosive situation\nWhen I ask you about swimming CNN is reporting today they are reporting Saudi Arabia is preparing to report that could show drew was killed during an ... that went wrong in other words that the Saudis might be willing to admit that he was killed a CNN citing to unnamed sources do we know anymore\nI I've heard the report certainly but I cannot confirm them at this time\nOkay so that's something to keep an eye on it to the question of of the U.S in Saudi Arabia and the relationship and whether President Trump has opened a door for Saturday to try to ... when we go out in some way I mean this is very awkward with two countries that are very strong allies\nRight here I Am name it's very strong relationship between the two countries they cooperate on things like counter terrorism and the the us political element to this as well it's certainly a Trump has been leaning on Saudi Arabia to keep gas prices low particularly ahead of the mid term elections\nAnd it was a multibillion dollar arms sale on the table as well which goes back to you know creating jobs here in America\nSo they may look at things like whatever happened with not ordered by Saudi leaders or perhaps it was an attempt to detain and interrogate ... that went terribly wrong um but that would contradict the Saudis claims that the journalists had left the consulate safely\nIsn't that great even I cannot do math now that that is a good deal isn't there a task to\nDo more is better yet and so call one eight hundred six seven eight seven four four for a friendly voice will be on the other end of the line they will thank you for calling take a little bit of information that will not take much time and then you can go on with the rest of your Monday afternoon\nAnd are among the other things you can do is lay claim to a beautiful calendar I Love the calendar we've got some amazingly talented photographers on the high plains and um they're photography right in front of you every day\nOr I call one eight hundred six seven eight seven four four four\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from log me in makers of go to meeting a collaborative meeting platform with over Eighteen million monthly users designed to connect people from anywhere in the world on any device learn more it go to meeting dot com [noise]\nFrom exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening tests that can be used at home by prescription only information at color guard test dot com and from the listeners who support the NPR station\nIt's all things considered from NPR News I'm Audie Cornish and I'm Mary Louise Kelly Senator Elizabeth Warren has released the results of a DNA test that says there is quote\nStrong evidence that she had Native American ancestry dating back six to ten generations this is an attempt to quiet a controversy that has dogged Warren for years and it comes\nAnd ancestry dating back six to ten generations this was an attempt to acquire a controversy that has dogged Warren for years and it comes to the Massachusetts Democrat molds a run for president in twenty twenty and fears of a holiday is on the story and she is in the studio now either pay [noise]\nStart with exactly what did a little bit of Warren released today shoot she released\nThe results of the DNA Analysis conducted by the Stanford University researcher his name is Carlos brings to mind day and he found that a vast majority of warns lineage is of European ancestry but he also wrote that her results strongly support the existence of a Native American ancestry\nYou know in addition to this DNA Analysis warning also released a campaign style video clips of President Trump mocking her mocking her claims of Native American ancestry and some vignettes from her family history she had this one scene in particular where she called ... the DNA researcher and puts him on the line\n... Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the raiders left one of 'em\nNow the president like to call my mom a liar\nOne of the fact that we have no interest or your editor\nSo ... you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says it's been passed down for generations\nSome can also here at least who wasn't of numbers have been to an audience of ... the president himself a lady responded to although he has\nAnd no one really made it but kind of a point that he had to respond to she tweeted at him about a promise that he made a sort of daycare at a rally this summer he suggested that if he were debate to debate her in twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said I Want\nFor trouble if you take the test so that shows your hair\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nSo merely this morning we're in the ass that he pay up to ... million dollars he or she wants this money to go she says to the national indigenous women's resource center that's at charity ever choice\nYou know Trump was asked by reporters about this challenge he denied making that promise even though as you all heard we just heard her late ... and the war in went after him again on Twitter saying you know asking him if he had memory problems and if they should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask about the timing of this does it have anything to do with ah the aspirations we mentioned that she is eyeing a run for president herself and twenty twenty I think that's a really\nRealistic I did this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November this is really about what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms\nAnd she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they have been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve\nAt that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had has taken to calling her Pocahontas so this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of that because the twenty twenty races going to kick off pretty much just in his mid term\nVery briefly has quieted all of the ...\n... no not at all I mean I can tell you real quick the Republican National committee said that the test revealed only a miniscule percentage of Native American ancestry that still leaves a lot of unanswered question All right so that is NPR's political correspondent Asma Khalid thanks very much

Administration is being drawn ever more deeply into the mystery of Jamal ... g's fate showed you was laughing entering the consulate in Istanbul earlier this month [laughter]\nToday President Trump spoke to Saudi Arabia's king Solomon who says his country had nothing to do with controlled used as parents Trump spoke to reporters about that conversation as he prepared to leave for a tour of areas hit by hurricane Michael\nYou didn't really know I don't want to get his side but it sounded to me like they just sort of thing for getting to the bottom of it as well as a flat denial\nWith me now to discuss this and the president's visit to Florida is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson Hi Mara I'm Mary Louise I'm real killers which was quite the turn of phrase do we know the president has thought deeply on those to come up with it on the fly with the president\nIs offering an alternative theory of the case although he didn't explain how a group of road killers could have gotten into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and killed someone\nBut his instinct is to deflect blame from the Saudi royal family he said several times today that the Saudi king flatly firmly denied it\nThis is very similar to what he did with ... and when he cited pollutants strong denials of any interference in the twenty sixteen election and back then he also offered an alternative theory of the case where he said someone weighing four hundred pounds sitting on his bed could have been the hacker of the Democratic party emails\nSo clearly the president's instinct is to defend dictators\nSo real killers or maybe the update on the four hundred pound guy say okay and I mentioned the president was on his way to Florida Today I it's very common of course for president to visit a disaster area but in Florida a few weeks before an election what are the politics of a presidential visit\nWell this was an official visit but it definitely had a political component because two of the most important races the cycle or in Florida the governor's race of course very important to Trump that a Republican remain governor there for twenty twenty for Trump's own reelection\nAnd also the current

Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish we're spending a few days looking at a striking disparity in prisons across the United states women are disciplined more frequently and often more harshly than men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR and them Adele school of journalism at Northwestern university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica papa that found that women are punished disproportionately from minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like a lot of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states in all but two women get this plan the higher rates than men [noise] what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison rules at rates we estimated often two to three times higher for what prison classify a smaller and fractions\nPetty stuff you can get written up for a not closing your doors you get written up for jumping on the phone without permission or if you just want to just fix your room up nice in just takes until late in value appeal the case you get written up for that\nThat tore a Williams and it made up the central California women facility inchoate show a California\nYou get written up for going out of bounds in somebody else's room\nAre out of bounds in the hallway [noise] it's just basically everything you get written up for\nOur numbers show that in California women compared to men get twice the disciplinary tickets for disobeying in order and more than twice as many for what's called disrespect\nIn Vermont we found women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called derogatory comments in Rhode Island they get more than three times the tickets for disobedience\nThose tickets have consequences women lose good conduct credits that kind of time at it to their stay in prison or lose phoning visitation privileges or go to solitary confinement in Rhode Island women were more than three times as likely as men to end up in solitary confinement for disobedience\n[noise] prisons were built for men and the rules for discipline were set up to control those math DMV ... says those rules don't\nWork very well with women you walk through a women's prison and it's a profoundly different experience we\nMet ... shoes visiting Logan Correctional Center a women's prison Illinois several years ago ... was a top official in the Illinois department of corrections now she works with prisons as a consultant she helps them address that problem of why women in prison get discipline more\nWomen are more communicative when you walk to a prison there more emotional they want to talk to you they want to talk about their children they want to talk about their experiences\nTwo years ago ... does help conduct an audit about women's prison in Illinois and found that women prisoners were just when almost twice as often as men for all of a fence was big and small but almost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor influence\nAnd they also really if they've seen injustice with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix the problem\nStates with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix that problem\n... Toto says she likes it that women prisoners are this way but she said many corrections officers and often even in a women's prison most of them are men say\nThey hate it the first thing that they'll tell you is these women are so difficult gosh they're a pain I Would rather work anywhere but here they always want to talk to you they won't take no for an answer\nCorrections officers are trained to keep control they expect women to be compliant if the women push back that's where those disciplinary tickets for influence come in\nTo women we met in Illinois total if they'd been written up some
