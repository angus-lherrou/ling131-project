I mean I should have been measured what issues on because you want to ... I I was given our soldiers\nAnd I heard you ran into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area\nThat trait I talked to Lisa Fletcher Jackson attorneys Eli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child\nI don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmother is no longer with us but I mean I I spend a lot of time in the Senate guys because where I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified with what happened and I hope that we could somebody comes to the changes conscious and attack on the Jewish people but at the half on\nOn everybody in a community and recover strong and we're going to make it through\nAnd I said she was with her niece who's sixteen alley they both of you know that there's many generations of the family have ties to the neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorials\n[noise] well I wouldn't tree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and get the forces families that were\nSo so what did they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate crime\nWell I just heard so much sadness so much shock and you always hear on the situation than in Lisa the the end\nShe mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun laws\nI think it's not about me definitely need to have gun laws so we definitely don't need to have you know security guards at our schools at our temple that our churches\nShouldn't have to I mean summaries for it to go like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers are to this but where we go to pray it's not even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here in Reno\nWelfare you've also been getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much yeah I think ...\nAnd ... other Pittsburgh faith communities took time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life synagogue the ... United Methodist church across town open their Sunday services to an interfaith group of worshipers\nAnd the church sanctuary there were eleven white roses displayed at the front one for each of the people killed in yesterday's attack and during that sort of ... name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory of ... she'll Lugar said he that he held a specialist\n... was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor Russell sugar so Lugar said he that he held a special trip to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed on to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my my Sherman to also find our voice you know we often say that we offer our prayers and thoughts\nAnd that is funny but we must do more we much put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with her boys and with our action as we can ensure that the hatred is not the new American way you can not be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out today as well\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put to target on her back on\nMy open and affirming you mean that everything every once in a while because everyone is welcome actual word right everyone is welcome and and normally welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today what is it more than you expected we had a couple of\nAh folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer the words of Thanksgiving they did not stay to worship but they do to come and to say thank you for doing this so that makes a difference\nIf I ask you don't seem rattled by that's maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I have to wonder you I mean you hear you\nMy daughter my youngest daughter turned into four roses in honor of\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events or because he was a police officer in white whole nuts were the ... a perpetrator lives\nChildren's very frightening pros personally um but I I Try to allow God ... the urge\nTo give me the bull ... that I Need\nI I Do not fear for myself I guess if I'm honest I fear for my my children my grandchildren\nBut yet I can allow hatred tuned to me and\nWe also met Laura hats she is the nursery attendant at the church responsible for caring for the congregations little its members during worship and for her yesterday as a tax on the synagogue where a baby naming ceremony with me was being held in the presence of children hit very close to home\nWell the churches rates any kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case the situation like that of course it's the nursery attendant\nThat has always been something that's been on my mind if they start here because I'm responsible for eight or nine children at a time and how I Would evacuating from the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I switched running through my head penance plant that I've come up for years really\nAnd is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened where you're thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so I have a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook happened when I was in high school\nOr things like that just always kind of words in the back of my mind it's kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad you know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that\nHurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for the children and that's what you have to be thinking and\nWe also met a father and son odor and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today and ... said his own life experiences allowed him to feel empathy for Pittsburgh Jewish community\nAnd African American beer and ... ... ... out of his friends are there is you're all through reserve neighborhoods or people to look at your front of\nA sudden one field are you should be better because of you or your color\nMatthew what about you I get the sense that this resonated with you even though it wasn't this particular attack directed at right and you verify and identify can you just described why that is\nBecause I remember I was looking at the news yesterday and I thought about reminder says I'm gay and Orlando resonated with me\nI'm also black and the south Carolina ... because it was people who are religious and they got killed because their their religious and this resonates with me because it's\nIt into this was constantly ... and I've learned that the current events Mooney not very shy about telling people what happened\nTo me um you know people I went through the same struggles and we are much stronger now ... recently had a huge hurricane and\nThank God we didn't really have that much damage nine yeah getting further and just being the best I can and

what is next what what are people saying if next\nI felt like people were in the sorrow this sort of cycle of sorrow and then pride in the solidarity that community showing\nAnd then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents but\nThe community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they said he talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in and wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence ... thank you thank you\nAnd as you just heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of the tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this that are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children\nAnd how to talk to them about tragedy like this NPR Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in Studio ... thanks so much for coming back and doing that sort of thing and I understand you've actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's\nAnd fortunately have covered several of these now my career in the journal at the end you know anytime there is in a sense of act of violence that's about ... ... it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community effected I it's impossible for kids not to hear about it right in the news and they're there\nDo you think it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected I it's impossible for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in a tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and\nNot terrified that so you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue the neighborhood outside the synagogue you also with the other places tell us about that\nActually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great when actually and\nUh they have open it up to the
