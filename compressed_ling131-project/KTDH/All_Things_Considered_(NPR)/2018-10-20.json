California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he would have occurred several times but it's er Kobe later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby it's Facebook the public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss\nThinking so much for having me now I have to ask do you think that race with a part of the encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it it has been shown that saves offices\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered 'em who went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to the rats and without harming him um it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus Iraq for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described it six foot three and three hundred pounds of those ... those are factual detail though aren't they I mean if you were the rabbit someone wouldn't you described those things you\nMight not have sampled do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as these latest Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nMhm [noise] it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues with that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because believe people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in that says well\nAbsolutely and I think here you'd see the impact of intersection nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think the ticks and I think I Know specific show and Kevin between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental um how has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this was comfortable for is that Silicon Valley it's often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the\nFor ... and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley it's often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where ... privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issue the poverty that aren't as connected to issue to mental health and certainly I think connected as he does raise\nIn terms of how people reacted I haven't been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I had the opportunity to talk about our story and ... story is a direct result as colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who I'm saddened by other means houses and story they needed to be told\nThat a cookie sheets that such a native of Kobe who died earlier this month after being paid by the San Mateo county a sheriff's deputy chief the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thinking so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct toward civilian particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life that's happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she mistook it for her home and of course ... is that the officer is white and the seats man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe you know I don't like that\nAre you know obviously had all\nThose rights West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with\nMy pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we're having over ... edition of African Americans and Latinos that end up in volatile confrontations with law enforcement traffic stops and I guess for land do cats do is kind of tipping iceberg for me\nIt's still end up cuts deal he was an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nAnd I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to at least to fire the\nBaby right traditions citizens and police officers ship which last year is that people are getting the legislation just focus on citizens will it doesn't\nIt doesn't just focus on video a video camera so it's a huge for additional course content for both the citizen and also pollution police academy\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy\nWhat we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the length of course as a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students to ... to what appear to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video is as a primer your we need to go back and make sure you mix it up that's why we do it but the purpose is to make certain we the fire behavior expectations polish off\nIs as a primer you know if we need to go back and makes it makes it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we the fire behavior expectations police officers and citizens and the citizens know what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast in the ...\nI didn't want to forgive me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that you sent sparked your concern here is an African American man in an encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tension why would you\nMeasure limit as this question you can pick out and that's fine because anything that I Do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could have ... behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put the behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens know what their rights are thought put it in schools and making it mandatory\nWas a great place to put it also also driver's license courses and also the police department of police academy and by doing that you have a great deal of repetition and hopefully that repetition will ultimately save lives\nLive

courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd what you've probably heard about the federal societies role in doing that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees that's produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that is a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduate who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and the all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secrets and signed something of a loyalty oath\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now I don't think so much for joining us because we're so what what's the stated purpose of this program how was it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training\nPurpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut she spoke with some legal scholars who said that this race ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learned secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve\nAnd something deeply problematic about having to make a promise that whatever they learn will be used for an open to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd dig into that if it like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts are kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties on to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat it's a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do ...\nYeah that that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nSo there are all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternities sorority they all kind of create\nPipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at that they've been particularly intentional at that [noise] um\nCreating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it did this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about is that they're counteracting the American legal academy worth the fancy law schools to professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far in trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably fine\nBut also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not fine\nAnd what does heritage say about that I Do know that when your piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually spending that's program what else did they say\nThey had been very close now it's about it I tried them repeatedly before and after the article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to say who was paying for it\nYou know their materials said a generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who those donors were they said\nFor it you know their materials said a generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who their donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who lives judges where and when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February\nThey just issued a brief blend statement saying they were reevaluating\nWhich suggests that perhaps they may try to reconstituted in a different form\nIt's entirely possible here that I'm

forward in a rare way at the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne report this week\nThat you might remember the ABC canceled the re boot of the popular Ninety show after star Roseanne Barr
