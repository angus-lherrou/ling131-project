this NPR station\nIt's all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report that summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of handling several cases and abuse well at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nUrge state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse\nI actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church I think what's missing here though isn't it knowledge meant by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now\nI'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think that the people have Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter it seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistake not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop we're all played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nBut with respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a cage especially when the data clearly shows the children who were abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that\nWe couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from\nAnd so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nKnow what your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there's so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes revive the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increased the accountability internally at these institutions when\nYou hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution\nIn the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to\nHold powerful institutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement and the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique in critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania\nJosh Shapiro is Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you\n[noise] some of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed a federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigating the current

and doing its workers wave of high hadn't gone off the brown\nLeon Jaworski told an interviewer in Nineteen Seventy seven the document contained in detail lists of the evidence the Watergate prosecution team had gathered\nWay called the road map in our office because it was just up\nFor forty four years that road map remained a secret under seal by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases\nThat secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work but not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton base was looking for a precedent for how a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referral to Congress\nThe national archives let me see a lot of stuff from the water ... a year to that was very interesting I when I asked you to load laugh at up to the house I lay on or if\nSaid no Bates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry ...\nIs relevant historians it's relevant to the infringing ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public\nRecord urgency because another special counsel is

many analysts feel that those numbers were inflated but still it does represent jobs for American another facet\nOf the fallout over the ... cars shaggy [noise] situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things matter with\nPresident Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve\nThis week after stock prices plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years I think the fed\nIs gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong All right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also\nSo how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy that maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it [noise] but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known privately to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed is from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate hike\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nUh with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed managing the economy could the president and help sway the fed to slow down the rate hike\nOr no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident\nThat it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using them for using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or I think is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up says attacks\nAnd others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a ...\nPolitical situation so I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states but it is doing the right thing but it does a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution much acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the marriage market could overtime German power ceases worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's\nGroup why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's as well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation for the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nThat's Donald ... the former vice chairman of the

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey at court ordered the release of an American pastor help for the past two years\nAndrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made it pastor Brunson case a priority men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely to moral as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from ...\nHi Mary Louise so where am I mean why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly he been convicted up\nWell he's pastor ran a small church in is near and western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected or enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to the Gulen turkey blamed for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses you would testify against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and then a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him while he's him and why released him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the ... who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had the court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that for instance an evangelical pastor that two steps his church that it was running and turkey\nAbsolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted\nKeith for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering a thirty five fighter just to turkey will lay really raised the issue of extra dotting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing his doubles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe Jamal ... that we've been tracking all of us that's where\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from stumble\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine he\nWas about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley he asked Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on this story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freaked does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to it and the price of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos it's owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got you did in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know\nA locally there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we ever received in product costs from manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost of the free does have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things that are free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that's in a bag afraid\nCarolyn Dmitri it's an applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she\nSays the price of a process food like free does has almost nothing to do with wealth food prices\nKill a much bigger part of the cost of food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation\nBecause trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma demo capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of free does might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies knowing them um because of the parent has gone up as well\nBecause it like the aluminum cans yeah\nThe U.S has not importing cheaper\nUm because the parent has gone up as well\nBecause it like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nOf all the companies Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset is more expensive can but they can't really do that right now stale so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking your cat is alive many of the other hand categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power or\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snack at your best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the big ...

listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe race for governor of Kansas will likely to decide whether the state finally expanded Medicaid program known as can care or stares at in another direction entirely new means ... of the Kansas news service report\nCandidates did not expand Medicaid after the passage of the Affordable CARE Act which means if you don't make enough money to qualify for Obamacare insurance subsidies but you make too much to qualify for Medicaid there is no government program in Kansas that will subsidize your healthcare\nYou also fall into that coverage gap if your income is low enough to qualify but you don't meet another requirement like being under Nineteen disabled elderly or pregnant\nTwo candidates for governor say they want to change that state senator Laura Kelly a Democrat I Will sign a bill to expand Medicaid and we know how important it is to rural Kansas and businessmen Greg Orman and independent\nMedicaid expansion has is something that would help us out with our workforce development population challenges\nThe Republican candidate Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach disagreed here's Kobach the Kansas State fair and September\nThe road if they do something smart as a lookout how we can spend that money effectively\nWhoever wins the race could make or break whether candidates finally expand Medicaid and received billions of federal tax dollars to pay for it\nUnder the Affordable CARE Act the federal government will pay almost all of the costs of covering new Medicaid recipients under expansion April home in is the executive director of the alliance for a healthy Kansas which advocates\nOf covering new Medicaid recipients under expansion April home in is the executive director of the alliance for a healthy Kansas which advocates for expansion\nIf we don't have a governor who support expansion we probably would have a similar results to what we had in the past\nIn twenty Seventeen state lawmakers voted to expand Medicaid but then governor Sam Brownback vetoed the bill saying it would cost too much money and didn't require recipients to work current governor Jeff Colyer also opposes expansion and favorites work requirements\nWe want to make sure that we're encouraging personal responsibility said discouraged dependency maker programs more economically rational\nSo a new governor could make a big difference in who gets Medicaid coverage how and whether they have to work for it some health policy experts say expansion would actually encourage recipients to work because they no longer be disqualified from Medicaid if they've started making more money\nCindy Samuel thin of the candles Hospital Association says Medicaid recipients sometimes suffer that penalty losing their coverage when they get a job if you were to make too much money you would not get the services you're now receiving and so\nThat is a challenge that that population deals with on a regular basis both Greg Orman and Laura Kelly say there are other economic benefits Orman argues expansion could bring more workers to Kansas because they know they'll have subsidized health care\nHealth policy analyst at Diane Rowland of the Kaiser Family foundation says expanding Medicaid often comes with economic benefits\nMost of the states that did expand have seen positive impacts on their overall state economic activity as well as saying at least job increases in some areas\nKelly argues expansion could create jobs and support the state's struggling rural hospitals which get much of their revenue from Medicaid reimbursement rolling says it's not a perfect solution but expansion would make it easier for hospitals to stay open increasing treatment options for rural patients\nMost of them are small most of them have some economic challenges in terms of being able to even recruit adequate staff and physicians there but if they do receive Medicaid funds to help supplement their income it helps to lead to broader financial stability\nMeanwhile Kris Kobach says expansion it's too expensive and the people who supported or naive\nAnd he goes on for\nKobach opposes Obamacare he says he'll asked President Trump for waivers so Kansas doesn't have to comply with Affordable Care act regulations\nIn campaign speeches Kobach had said he would combine can care with a subscription system called direct primary care but in many ways it's a proposal that raises more questions than answers\nFor the Kansas news service I'm no mean it would be a dean in Topeka\nAnd you are listening to all things

dot com\nAnd from the sustaining members of this NPR station it's\nAll things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since the report that summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse like the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report\nPennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro birds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions you on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse\nI actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church I think what's missing here though is and the knowledge meant by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now\nI'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think that the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter it seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nThat with is completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty\nAnd so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward\nWe shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes revive the statute of limitations get it that when it actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions\nWere you hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution\nIn the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to hold powerful\nInstitutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement and the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique and critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania\nJoshua Shapiro is Pennsylvania state attorney
