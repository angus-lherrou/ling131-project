computer creating a portrait that's being auctioned by such a prestigious art house now that is new\nArt appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale and she joins us now to talk about how the art world it's taking all this and welcome thank you a pleasure to be here Elsa\nHow controversial is is in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auctioned off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we can set our art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine or by Marcel Just chomp where he literally took a men's urine on hanging on a wall right\nAnd it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what are actually is\nFor the twenty first century so I don't think that it is um I once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen again and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat it's so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it seems like a technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply well they still apply\nBut let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or any work of art really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to tell it via Christi is\nAll are within the saying we'll how in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process to roll out\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at why people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the ... who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artists ownership I Do believe it's split between the programming the code words the collective and maybe even a little bit of a ... for helping

this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened because it's as a candidate print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited and

tune became a very prominent tool in a lot of pop R B and hip hop production [noise]\nTo me auto tune sounds sort of like digital stretching are flexing your shearing a singer kind of slide up and down the register\nAnd up in a way that doesn't sound natural but auto tune can amplify an expression of passion in or emotion in a singer to me I think of a song like hide and seek by the singer

portray going on to Christie's auction block Thursday maybe reminiscent of a Rembrandt but it's actually the work of artificial intelligence\nIt's called a portrait of Edmund Bellamy the work was created using an algorithm and it might fetch around ten thousand dollars\nComputer's making art is nothing new but a computer creating a portrait that's being auctioned by such a prestigious art house now that is new art appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this and welcome thank you pleasure to be here outside how controversial is this in the art world or a painting to be painted by a non human and then auctioned off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine or by Marcel disarm where he literally took and then you're knowing how to get on a wall right\nAnd it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what are actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining\nSo I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen again and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat it's so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand if things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price an art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply well they still apply\nBut let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or anywhere 'cause I really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to ... in comparison with where they wanted to tell it via Christi is\nAll are within that saying we'll house in terms of number\nAnd does that worked at St ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process to roll out\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at why people are willing to pay for it\nTo the artist in this case is it the voters who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artists have to be a little bit of all of those original artists ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the ... the collective and maybe even a little bit of a ... for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garner the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated art work has gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off\nAnd so this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened because it's it's a candidate print\nIt absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited in numbered edition after the sale I don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nAaron Marie ... the c._e._o. of rare era appraisals just outside Washington DC thank you very much thank you so much pleasure Elsa\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]
