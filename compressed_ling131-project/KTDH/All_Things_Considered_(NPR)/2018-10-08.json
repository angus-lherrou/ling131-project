Chang Philadelphia is getting closer to opening what may be the country's first facility where people can use illegal opioids and other drugs all under medical supervision and nonprofit had foreign to launch the so called supervised injection sites\nAs Bobby Allyn of member station WHYY reports Trump treatments visuals are watching and promising a crackdown\nEarlier this year officials in Philadelphia have been studying the idea of a supervised injection site where those struggling with addiction bring their own drugs and use under the watch of medical professionals\nThe creation of the nonprofit called safe house is the most significant step so far and making that a reality one of the most prominent board members of the group is former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell twelve hundred and Seventy Philadelphians\nSite as Bobby Allyn of member station WHYY reports Trump treatment officials are watching and promising crackdown\nSince earlier this year officials in Philadelphia have been studying the idea of a supervised injection site where those struggling with addiction bring their own drugs and use under the watch of medical professionals\nThe creation of the nonprofit called safe house is the most significant step so far and making that reality one of the most prominent board members of the group is former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell twelve hundred\nAnd Seventy Philadelphians of overdoses most of them died alone in the year twenty Seventy so highest rate per capita of any big city in America we've got to do something to stop in\nOther cities grappling with the opioid crisis including New York Seattle in San Francisco are considering opening a supervised injection sites but I haven't done so yet California Governor Jerry Brown recently vetoed a law that would help open one saying it would enable illegal drug use\nIts position shared by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein who told NPR in August that the Justice Department will not tolerate the opening of a supervised injection site in Philadelphia\nIt remains illegal under federal law and people engagement activity remains vulnerable to civil and criminal enforcement\nMessage from his Rosenstein um incorporate or a safe injection site nonprofit an income interests me first\nRun ... says his brazen position takes him back in time to the early Nineteen nineties when he was mayor and welcome Philadelphia's first clean needle exchange during the AIDS crisis but offering clean needles to drug users is one thing inviting them into a building to use illegal opioids is a different matter entirely\nAround the gold fine with the AIDS Law Project a Pennsylvania is another board member of safe house the new nonprofit she agrees that it's a controversial idea but the model has saved lives in Canada in Europe\nThe idea is if today we can prevent that fatal overdoses and we can build that relationship of trust then maybe tomorrow or even later today we can encourage that person to get into treatment\nAlthough city officials are not directly involved with a nonprofit Philadelphia's mayor and district attorney support putting the site in Kensington the heart of the city's opioid problem the nonprofit is already raised two hundred thousand dollars but the city council woman whose district includes\nKensington Maria Sanchez is still on the fence\nService component before we can talk about saving ... other pool\nOn a recent visit to Kensington the desperation was everywhere syringes and drug bags strewn across sidewalks and train platforms people nodding off in front of homes exit Delhi's leaning against park cars\nThis is how forty two year old ray describes it reusing just his first name because he uses illegal opioids pain and ground zero of zombie lame and it's it's just crazy raise wearing a pink shirt and shorts at the Phillies baseball cap on backward\nHe says he'd go to the supervised injection sites because right now he uses next door staffing and they only way back yard and [noise]\nAnywhere or they felt officials won't say yet when they hope to open their doors but one thing is clear if they if getting people like ray off the streets\nAnd into a medical facility means defined the Trump Administration so be it\nFor NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia [noise]\nIt's time now for all tech considered\n[noise] this month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting you to facial recognition test\nThey felt officials won't say yet when they hope to open the doors for one thing is clear say F. getting people like ray off the streets and into a medical facility means defined the Trump Administration\nSo be it for NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia [noise]\nIt's time now for all tech considered\n[noise] this month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones and some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she they facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it\nWas there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed wider use of the software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would jus really quite well with well controlled facial images when elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know changing age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nEven one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that Mitt's identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas I'm\nJust wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistake like that happen\nYeah this is a really excellent point\nThe current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different\nRaces so you're saying there are just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color yes oh the answer\nTo the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate\nHow you make the Web on rates biased that's a harder question so even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use the technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAnd someone who really understands where that science is today how do you think about this um is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this\nWhen it is accurate there are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use the technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where that science is today how do you think about this um\nIs face recognition technology abused um that's certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very much thank you [noise]\n\nFor all tech considered comes from the three I O T providing a software platform that enables organizations to deploy artificial

management solutions for the modern workplace learned more adult summit software dot com ultimate software people first [noise]\nAnd your book is titled the poison squad comes from project which he undertook it really just shows his commitment to this ah describe it the Portland squad was\nWell this is an experiment you could never do today because he basically goes out and recruits other people at the department of agriculture\nEspecially young clerks to volunteer to dine very dangerous lay and so the idea of the poison squad\nWas that three free meals a day seven days a week super fancy meals are cooked by a professional chef of all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree\nThat half of you at any given period in the experiment are going to be adding capsules that content suspect food additives and the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you are testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers\nWhat's that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had this rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nNo one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply the the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with congressman to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and ads they catch national attention which they did they were a front page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food\nAnd so there's this in media push back\nRight in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes they create a food Manufacturers Association\nAnd and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these ...\nLee realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food and so there's this in media push

mired in debt and beholden to the Chinese NPR's Eyder Peralta brings us the story of one big project in Kenya [noise]\nMy my journey in Nairobi where the train station is quite easily the most impressive public building in the country it's modern with ambitious looping lines\nThe train runs from the capital city to the portable pops up in represent the biggest infrastructure project since independence for Kenya it was funded entirely with a three point two billion dollar Chinese loan a Chinese company built it and the Chinese will operated for many years to come\nIt's hard to forget at the entrance of every single wagon the Kenyan flag it's flanked by a Chinese flag and as soon as I sit down here to strangers having a spirited argument about Chinese involvement\nThinking of\nThe jungle a marketing executive says can you can learn something from the Chinese they built nearly three hundred miles of rail ahead of schedule he says he would drive past the construction site some times and he saw the Chinese working non stop\nAnd they would see how the meats and some people walking in the region the one thing leads me any saving then he won the last one it's\nA whole trip that turned a poor country into an industrial powerhouse says and Kenyans would be wise to pay attention that they can do a lot in a lawyer interrupting she does Kenyans do not want Chinese culture\nIn any way for people of color they should have to make their own\nAgenda is unconvinced Kenyans like to talk he says they like to take breaks Chinese are not like that\nIs the American idol ten enemies and title east would be much\nAs he talks another lady across from him jumps into the conversation\nWas going on\nIn case you didn't hear it she says this guy is colonized\nWhat you do know is that when I

that\nAnd the acrimony over the Chinese and over the spending it melts what's happening here in Kenya is happening across the continent International Monetary fund says forty percent of sub\nSaharan countries are at risk of that distress and China is playing a big role they've handed out billions for projects and places like Ethiopia Guyana in Mozambique that no one else would touch\nIt means Ethiopia got a new rail line to the port of Djibouti in Ghana has an expressway but there are also worries\nBy some estimates the Chinese loans have bumped up should booty debt to GDP ratio from fifty to eighty five percent only between the years of twenty fourteen to twenty sixteen so we're talking about\nA lot of money oh to China\nThat's grant T Harris a former Africa advisor to President Obama he says these Chinese loans are also very different from other international loans because the terms are often secret\nWhat we do not have transparency on is what really is the collateral and the very scary case in point is Sri Lanka\nJust at the end of last year ... found itself struggling to pay back its debt so they had that China a strategic port on the Ninety nine year lease so what happens if you ... can't\nPay back its support what happened to Kenya can't pay back its train the FDR unsaid wearing a development economist here in Kenya says the problem is\nWe don't know as a public

what happens in case of default but they would provide no concrete answer\nWhere it's at these types of deals worked for many governments they let them build visible projects that help them win

they say Trump could use the Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi or her successor as a foil and cruise to re election way Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did the Corey Lewandowski isn't buying it\nI've heard people say that and whoever says that should be fired because clearly\nThey had no understanding of how politics works I think this president and his agenda and what you've been able to accomplish he's only been able to do because the Republicans have been in office\nOne thing both Democrats and Republicans agree on is that this White House is just not prepared for the consequences of losing former Bill Clinton advisor Paul the Gallup says no White House really is\nThey have no idea what it feels like I Do realize how she's going to the Obama people would have felt like when there were sixty three is a gut punch there's a very real psychological and political price\nPart of that price the rock solid hold President Trump has on the Republican Party in Congress could be

response than like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram follow words and a lot of people don't really look up to her so there's a lot of support there's also of course\nThere's kind of his movement that has always thought maybe she would secretly a conservative just because

as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now\n[noise] I think it did in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio

predicting really the same consequences of climate change that previous report that in predicting but this report says the consequences will happen sooner\nYeah that's the basic idea and when I read it for the first time I was struck with the urgency and they really laid out which such precision the hearing now element of this problem and not do it for the grandkids\nSo many of these effects you just mentioned hit around twenty forty also affect you and I plan to be here around twenty I order in lido yeah so what this is a kind of sharing now impacts of the scientists were writing about\nSo what would it take to avert that I mean there's report it saying we basically have a deadline coming up in about Twenty years are a real changes feasible within that timeframe\nAbsolutely exists you hear some of those studies ... it makes you think\nGosh I just want to hide under the covers and\nWatch them Netflix but if you think about it facing this kind of impossibility is really something that's extent what humans were made for and the report lays out really well if we're willing to take on the kind of effort that we've had in the past and\nHumans have done it also and in World War

launch the so called supervised injection sites as Bobby Allyn of member station WHYY reports Trump station officials are watching and promising a crackdown since\nEarlier this year officials in Philadelphia have been studying the idea of a supervised injection site where those struggling with addiction bring their own drugs and use under the watch of medical professionals\nThe creation of the nonprofit called safe house is the most significant step so far and making that reality one of the most prominent board members of the group is former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell twelve hundred\nAnd Seventy Philadelphians died of overdoses most of the alone in your twenties Seventy so high is red per capita of any big city in America we've got to do something to stop\nOther cities grappling with the opioid crisis including New York to Seattle in San Francisco are considering opening a supervised injection sites but I haven't done so yet California Governor Jerry Brown recently vetoed a law that would help open one saying it would enable illegal drug use\nIts position shared by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein who told NPR in August that the Justice Department will not tolerate the opening of a supervised injection site in Philadelphia it remains illegal\nUnder federal law and people engagement activity remains vulnerable to civil and criminal enforcement measures Rosenstein um incorporate or a safe injection site nonprofit an incumbent arrest me first\nRun ... says his brazen position takes him back in time to the early Nineteen nineties when he was mayor and welcome Philadelphia's first clean needle exchange during the AIDS crisis but offering clean needles to drug users is one thing inviting them into a building to use illegal opioids is a different matter entirely\nAround the gold fine with the aid Law Project of Pennsylvania is another board member of safe house the new nonprofit she agrees that it's a controversial idea but the model has saved lives in Canada in Europe\nThe idea is if today we can prevent that fatal overdoses and we can build that relationship of trust then maybe tomorrow or even later today we can encourage that person to get into treatment\nAlthough city officials are not directly involved with a nonprofit Philadelphia's mayor and district attorney support putting that site in Kensington the heart of the city's opioid

for NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia [noise]\nIt's time now for all tech considered\n[noise] this month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them\nHere in the U.S we're gradually getting you to facial recognition technology that in our phones and some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology to answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she they facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there was some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed white or use of the software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know a change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is facial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistake like that happen [noise] yeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and eggs\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as real as\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistake like that happen [noise] yeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically\nMany images of a particular person and an accurate labels\nAnd so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races so you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make\nThe Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question\nSo easily win facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use the technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this\nUm is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very much thank you [noise]\n\nFor all tech considered comes from the three I O T providing a

really just shows his commitment to this ah described the poison squad was\nThis is an experiment you could never do today because he basically goes out and recruits other people at the department of agriculture\nEspecially young clerks to volunteer to dine very dangerous lay and so the idea of the poison squad\nWas that three free meals a day seven days away super fancy meals that are cooked by a professional chef of all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree\nThat half of you at any given period in the experiment are going to be adding capsules that contains

was that three free meals a day seven days away super fancy meals that are cooked by a professional chef of all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree\nThat half of you at any given period in the experiment are going to be adding capsules that content suspect food additives and the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you are testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers what's that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had this rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea\nI'll just tested on people and so he did\nNo one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply the the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with Congress men to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and ads they catch national attention which they did they were a front page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them everyone and suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food and\nSo there was this in media pushback\nRight in which suddenly congressman or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes they create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen\nAnd they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fight to expand decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde and arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes once this\nFirst food safety law that path and Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his famous poison squad experiments wants that law went into a place\nWe started pulling stuff out of formaldehyde when ... went out more acts went out we are cynical it out right you really see government stepping up for some of these outlook extremely dangerous compound\nIs that spoke just one big argument in favor of government regulation in\nBecause it certainly should be a reminder of that before government regulation food was a constant\nUnknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk but it's also I Hope jumped the good story it's a story of something that I Love\nI
