excellence in the digital age this is all\nThings considered from NPR News I'm also Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the terrorists impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means that the United states\nWe are the economic and the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is this the president so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut the sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China and the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten you six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim an economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen you're on fall if it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right\nAnd so the question is why they're selling it and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe cameras I'll watch will increase the costs of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't stay well partly counteracted\nTrump has so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blunt their impact Lim says the following you on may also have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to violence and below project\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency it's helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we have in the ... Chinese scores you financial information but China system also considered information like what you buy and how you treat your neighbors\nBut China's system also considered information like what you buy and how you treat your neighbors if you fail to pay your debt you find yourself on a sort of blacklist\nStacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator pie kept bringing us the story about life on China's list of on trustworthy people\nLoved one is forty two he lives in ... province in China and one day he went online to book a high speed train ticket to Beijing\nHe put down his name and payment but right away this page popped up thing he could not complete the purchase\nOr go up on the verge on our news says and this person is on the uh unprecedented Liz from the cart\nLoved one was confused why couldn't he took the train ticket he started looking into the situation and he quickly realize why this was happening loved one has landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nDo one thing that comes along with the blacklist on top of arts and live that uh you're fired from\nHigh end consumption which means that you can't take a speed train you can fly\nChina started to block with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust in banking and financial system and part of his was involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that with his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapsed\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near when it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank he found out that all of his account and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town he discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards by the side of the road was his face like up on a big building\nAnother more to be electric ...\nBy the side of a beep plaza there are like huge grants and they're very eye catching you can't really say them from afar and I saw my my pictures and that's going on like a picture of on my ID card and my ID card number and my name\nThe billboard said this man is on trustworthy loud wanted these billboards are all over town\nShe says whenever he went out whenever he sees a billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up but one day when he was doing that you saw the face of someone he knew\nOr whatever they're doing with all of our own knock on doors and we have to be ... in the same industry as I did all know up there\nLoud started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist\nHe started calling them saying hey I'm On the list to get started getting people together meeting up for dinner he says these are the only people that he can really be relaxed around\nAbout what don't actually\nSee the widespread attitude toward the U.S is very resistant and people were saying why are you sure been happy widely used to have time to be happy [laughter] why do you not to go out and make money to pay back\nYour loan so far loud one says he has paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed so still about one point two million to go\nBut even when loud one does manage to pay off its debts getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked to ... and trying to deal with this\nMillion to go but even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked lawyers and trying to deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt\nWell it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen we reached out to China Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment loud one says he will keep paying off his dead you have to believe there's a way off this list Cardiff Garcia Stacey Vanek Smith NPR News

of paper\nThat doesn't have to follow all use rules one of the rules is you can't look at a member of the opposite sex more than three seconds what\nSo and not offend someone didn't make no sense to me\nOverall forty three percent think the me too movement has gone to farm encouraging and over sensitivity for example or a rush to judgment that includes one quarter of Democrats versus three quarters of Republicans\nOh yes yes definitely\nCarol rackets Seventy four year old Republican from California is among those who say the benefit of the doubt in cases like this should not go to

someone from a different identity group\nThat's something we see here ah you know in the U.S as we look at some of the partisan political divisions\nThe way to prevent disagreements from becoming violence according to experts in civil conflict is to be more open to those with whom we disagree\nThe biggest challenge that many people have been in their own lives is really taking the first step to not when you disagree with someone to listen first that's job and it's again I think as you look at the U.S today we're entering a period of of conflict but you know even if conflict is inevitable

Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by\nSlapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means for the United states\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is this the president so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut the sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China and the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten used six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim an economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen you're on falls it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they selling it and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand\nMeanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker the strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nWeaker the strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe cameras I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't stay well partly contracted\nTrumpet so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blunt their impact Lim says the following you on may also have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and little product\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we have in the U.S China scores use financial information\nBut China's system also considers information like when you buy and\nHow you treat your neighbors if
