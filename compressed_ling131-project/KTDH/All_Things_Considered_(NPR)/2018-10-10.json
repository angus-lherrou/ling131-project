Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen Saudis flew into stamp all last week drove to the Saudi conflict and then deported that same day on private planes headed for Cairo and goodbye\nAnd it says according to the Washington Post to which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working the story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudi sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that faded Fifteen people it's a lot to to to kill an individual and a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said\nIt actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but what we are understanding is that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show you not clear whether they wanted to capture\nAnd prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way okay let's\nLet's unravel that a little bit ... U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications have what Saudi officials discussing ...\nCorrect is is us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on a show of you to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening stumble could be sort of a plan B or for that they send the teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe\nAt the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows the Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I eat did they warn ...\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government warn ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believe that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know which are up to\nBack off ... why do you think Shane Harris your source wants you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I\nI think there's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime and Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harm it's come to him and there's a real concerned about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that visit administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups and Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a hoot to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced that he's sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership in Saudi Arabia\n[noise] when you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in ...\nLearn about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership in Saudi Arabia\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S from Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely jerk ... sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and that I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other and a number of occasions and there's a personal bond there that has translated into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hoped for to weaken or overturn roe v Wade at the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights and pure Sarah McCammon reports that Supreme\nCourt can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon penny Nance the c._e._o. of the conservative group concerned women for America which supported Kavanaugh\nWe're taking a moment here to rejoice and the fact that he was actually confirmed and uh but very quickly even after the swearing in we were talking about starting to get together and think about you know the the best cases to move forward to fit in front of the court\nSeveral state laws severely restricting abortion are already making their way through the court system including one from Iowa that would ban the procedure as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected often before a woman do she's pregnant\nKavanaugh is replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy who was often the swing vote on abortion and other contentious issues\nSo advocates on both sides are watching to see how much the new court is willing to restrict abortion Planned Parenthood executive vice president Don McGahn said in some ways the last several years have been a training ground for what could be coming she said that many states have passed laws that force women to go to great lengths to get abortions\nAlready women across this country half to access funding they have to access transportation they have to access housing that have to access support networks that is going to be a greater need\nIf they're further restrictions when row is attacked by the court\nThose efforts will now be supersized ... says she says Planned Parenthood will lobbies state legislatures to strengthen protections for abortion rights and expand services in states with more liberal lot\nDr any Whittaker is medical director at Planned Parenthood of Illinois she's expecting to see more women coming from more restrictive states across the Midwest\nWe know that we're going to need an ironclad networks and states and providers across the country or abortion will still be legal and accessible no matter what happens on the Supreme Court\nIn the past two years the organization has expanded surgical abortion services from two to five locations in Illinois nationwide Planned Parenthood also will work to increase access to medication abortion and use technology to connect women with information about where they can get the procedure\nBoth sides are also preparing for the midterm elections next month the abortion rights group ... pro Choice America has launched a million dollar ad by telling supporters to vote out Republican candidates this November this at open with an image of Kavanaugh's face right\nLaunched a million dollar ad by telling supporters to vote out Republican candidates this November this that opens with an image of Kavanaugh's face\nRight now women are wondering

Quigley Susan B. Anthony List the Kavanaugh fight has also served as a reminder of the importance of elections\nThe cat in a confirmation battle ... why we acted this to begin with you know why we've been engaging in Senate races across the country since last summer and that's because you know potentially the Senate it'll air Supreme Court justices are and armed\nWith cabin on the Supreme Court advocates on both sides say their bases are energized and ready for the next phase of the battle over abortion rights Sarah McCammon NPR News and\nThat's the end you have like once again your hopes for all things

with gusts of a hundred and fifty five miles per hour by the time Michael reaches the Carolinas tomorrow it is expected to be downgraded to a tropical storm\nAs NPR's Tom Gjelten reports from Wilmington North Carolina some of the problems are hurricane can bring only emerge weeks after the storm passed\nAt the market north apartment complex in Wilmington you hold trucks lined the streets the apartment buildings here survived the storm and tax but the power was out for many days during heavy rain and the units were damaged by mold the roughly five hundred residents are being told to have to vacate moving on to\nHim or without a where to go to\nGary Moore and his girlfriend are hauling furniture out more says they'll put it all in storage he was planning to move in with his mother but he just found out her apartment has been temporarily condemned as well\nFEMA representatives are on the ground here they can give the displace tenants some rent money to get them started but they can find new housing for them the apartment owners giving each tenant a thousand dollars in cash but Moore says that won't go far\n... and they noticed over the age I Love to go to a game of the month of able to do it at all like your listener a\nMars girlfriends Harris who kings sits in a chair by the front door her head in her house I'm stressed out [noise]\nIs the fact that the red cross here says about seven hundred and fifty people in Wilmington need shelter now not counting those living with friends or relatives churches that provided shelter want their facilities back schools the sheltered people are reopening so the housing problem here is actually getting worse not better\nSame with the economic situation some problems show up only after business owners assess the damage employees can be caught unprepared like Tony Witherspoon she worked at a gourmet markets in downtown Wilmington\nWe closed during a hurricane we actually opened\nBack up that Tuesday for the public after the hurricane um ...\nWe received a letter that they were going to be temporarily seething operation\nSo what looked like a promising situation suddenly turned oblique\nThey didn't give us a

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen Saudis flew into stamp all last week drove to the Saudi conflict and then deported that same game on private planes headed for Cairo and to buy\nAnd it says according to the Washington Post which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working that story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudi sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that feed is Fifteen people it's a lot to to kill an individual and a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said\nIt actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but what we are understanding is that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show you're not clear whether they wanted to capture\nAnd prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way\nOkay let's let's unravel that a little bit the says U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what what Saudi officials discussing 'cause she'll be\nIs is us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on the show you down a few thousand or the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia and capture him there I\nThink probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening and stumbled could be sort of a plan B\nOr for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after a he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate but it shows that\nGroup laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate but it shows the Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I eat did they warn ...\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government warn ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believe that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know which are up to\nBack off ... why do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I\nI think there's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime in Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harm it's come to him and there's a real concerned about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups and Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a hoot to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced that he's sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership and Saudi Arabia\n[noise] when you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely jerk ... sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and I think it's very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other and a number of occasions and there is a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist

from last month's Hurricane Florence and now here comes Michael the storm slammed into the Florida Panhandle today\nWith gusts of a hundred fifty five miles per hour by the time Michael reaches the Carolinas tomorrow it is expected to be downgraded to a tropical storm\nAs NPR's Tom Gjelten reports from Wilmington North Carolina some of the problems are hurricane can bring only emerge weeks after the storm it passed\nAt the market north apartment complex in Wilmington you hold trucks lined the streets the apartment buildings here survived the storm and tax but the power was out for many days

business has insurance a disaster can wipe it out\nIf you don't have the insurance you don't have a hard time recovering 'cause you've lost that you know three or four weeks of income\nYour employees are likely to have become displaced and you can't get them back [noise] so it delays your ability to open up your store or your restaurant or or your business\nFEMA famously estimates as many as forty percent of small businesses will fail in the aftermath of a disaster like the one that hit North Carolina\nCommunity leaders here hoped to disprove that production but it's too soon to tell whether
