News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises the question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the state by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all into the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis with reached out to link Saunders is an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation and it's here but there's going to be huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my office is the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nJust a person that there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was ... there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that can be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past the he has used candidate prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used candidates whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law [noise] taking that what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation of less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which should take a hands off approach unless it comes to your ...\nSystem with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which should take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state the rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened\nNPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThat arrived or say come like somebody's trying to get in in the inside door was shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought just hang in there and I save everything was going to be okay for\nWhen last doors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the same can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone the storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road\nHigh winds lifted off roofs and knock down walls quite a few gates is the former head of FEMA and a longtime urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle in many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I call it the old Florida it's not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all generational of Florida families many of them or just said that Trump folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... to Reno a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes on the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we saw damage to pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig view gate has long believed wind speed standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nIt yeah that store back in and out particularly yet Michael back in is going to force a much higher\nCentury before accurate record keeping\nIt yeah that store back in and out ... yet Michael back in is going to force a much higher global warming or the coast well inland based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now the process of re box in the state code and as a wedding recommendations from the University of Florida team led by David provide provide said understanding how to build resilience structures is just the first step\nWe knew what had been shut you weigh the\nRealtors home builders the insurance

couple of years ago scientists announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life in rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossil are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo candidates at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland that was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more\nSurgeries revealed they'd found similar mineral structures in Greenland that was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they'd been more cook and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nThan some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossil a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures are really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better where they kind of look like ... bars they're stretched out riches that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all what is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA\nIs planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt hit playing and it's OK calling from Minneapolis to in order to gain a lot on not\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arrive and take cold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils\nSo far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word now Greenfield deploying NPR News\n[noise] and you're listening to NPR News\n\nA hundred and Fifteen billion while and fierce rats are hurting and reporting from Brussels thank you sir I oh You're welcome Mary Louise\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for British and European economies\nGeorge Parker has written about it she's a political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following the negotiations or come back to the program ... if there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty ninth when the u._k. leaves the\nWell they could be caught severely all depends on what kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal with\nEverybody ended up throwing places each other in person left to you\nIn very bad judge and indeed than you could see some very serious impacts of the border so you would have a I mean you'd have checks on old goods coming in and also the u._k. which doesn't help at the moment that will quickly to she's accused of the ports coming into person\nAnd very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England the full cost this could be actually a very tail sicken damaging upside for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning going on the case in case this happens talk of stockpiling of medicines\nThere's the fresh food road could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool that will be quite bad and the pursuit told me we'll take a very big hit\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicine and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines once you introduce border checks the place where there are ... you could have she's running about ... miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so\nSo there are concerns that will be shortages setting in more distant ... from the pool so\nA pretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what would happen in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it paused you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red type of the ... and that without to business costs\nWill make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market the potential for targets as well\nSo the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than otherwise would've been the case which is a pretty big hits as production to sort of an aircraft\nGradually losing hide you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a ...\nOtherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hits as production to sort of an aircraft gradually losing hide you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a poor place in other words it would be\nSo those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if UK leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that you wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European exports so they will be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's somewhat and they won produces in France cop juices in Germany\nUm you name it they they will be affected because UK off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is an asymmetric shocked Walsh it's true that some of the European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's a lot to be honest I I mean we all questioned the Y. yet so I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides are not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister does or deal in Brussels she got up to sell it to a very divided policy back in ... I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial Times thanks for joining us as always pleasure\nHe Mm Mm Mm Mm [noise]\n\n[noise] ...\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nSupport for high plains public radio comes from allergy arts and Dr Constantine Sunday at specialists treating allergy asthma and all types of arthritis sixty eight forty to pump creek Dr Amarillo\nAnd thank you for joining during all things considered I'm Angie halfway the host and I'm In the studio with Katie Fulton and we're just talking about the coming an upcoming election and the\nPartisanship that seems to be more prevalent than ever and so now more than ever and good solid news source is very important to helping you uh make an informed decision when you cast your vote 'em really soon here a couple a couple of weeks from now\nSo if that's something you support and appreciate now is a great time to call because you will get your dollars doubled think to a thousand dollar membership match from Clinton hope who is that the H.

of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use our our ground be found in the midst of all and to the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to win Saunders immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when Congress welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my office says the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse that sat there would be an\nThe individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse that sat there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was ... there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where are you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they

that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing you wrote out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThat arrived or shake somebody's trying to get in and the anti door was shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought just hang in there and I save everything was going to be okay for when last\nDoors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the same can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone the storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls\nQuite a few gates is the former head of FEMA and a long time urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases gets old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I called the ... or not a bunch of high rises on a lot of construction\nThis is all generational of Florida families many of them or just said that Trump folks to fish the area's after hurricane\nThe construction this is all the generational of Florida

Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised its statewide building code John ... a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that it's sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes on the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction need only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm has local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that spent the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we were damage to pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of housing what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig Fugate has long believed the wind speeds standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nIt yeah that store back in and out

discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action in schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nKate thanks for having me well why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think make nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see a mission policies change not to have faith in it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering when it says the students qualifications\nYeah I think ... when it comes down to that rate just sort of something that is becoming not just nearly factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they do that but let's see ... had been showing in the past few days and has really brought to light and fat oftentimes it is the single rates Fat Chance that kind of found someone shake action\nStudents missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say yes yep\nOftentimes it is the single rates factor that comes down to someone search action\nStudents are as missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal reading to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case have alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost at the front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kind of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think it's really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo I think\nThat a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources an opportunity to people have available to them it's really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at net in the context of race but again like I said married in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone who's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified and grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of that sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to racial ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks for having me\nShe's a junior at Harvard and you are listening
