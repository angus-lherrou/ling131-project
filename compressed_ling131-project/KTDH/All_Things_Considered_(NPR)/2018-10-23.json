claims with NPR's Scott Horsley hey there Scott I already first let's talk about the caravan of Central American migrants the president has been talking a fair bit about that\nThey're making their way to Mexico in hopes of reaching the U.S border I'm now President Trump has suggested that they're not just a family looking for a better life what is he thing instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly you have people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and Tom not letting them and\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty four for ... war from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that\nGroup or there's no evidence then of Middle Eastern infiltration the president had not presented any why is he talking about it\nIllegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first launched his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear on his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nI just started on that list with the tax cuts which I think a lot

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish strict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year\nIn Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the name didn't exactly match names on IDs a North Dakota law requiring voter id to include street addresses has also gotten attention\n... considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities she's the head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I answer about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we'd say state and posing stretch photo identification laws uh meaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of ideas in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue I've been reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurchase a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted and two in three cycles or look we're not sure if this person still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators youth sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late\nUm critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election processes we're not going to be discriminatory and we're saying that those areas are having an even higher increasing the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling is voter suppression um do the courts agree with\nSo many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to the kinds of ah laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it at suppression yet I I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degrees so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a enacted in two thousand eleven looks\nTalking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a an acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law that is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much uh but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nUm many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place\n... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project thank you for speaking with all things\nConsidered thank you [noise] there are a few subjects that can divide families more quickly than politics can mother against father father

I've been a cop who were twenty three years people want to be represented by someone was going on more so\nThat's one of many reasons why I voted for bribes fell for Congress\nThe ads seems pretty typical political attack ads go and it is except that the person speaking it's the brother of style democratic opponent Randy Bryce Joseph ... is a democratic strategist in Wisconsin He says the ad reflects a political attitude in the state and across the country that's become more nasty and polarizing\nWe heard about it it's been said arbitrary together that what's happening with jobs were divisive politics as literally as a family member tips but I'm a number that I went wow you're that is really just ugly at a public what\nThe heck he said this kind of ad is bad for candidates and voters because it makes elections less about issues and more about candidates personal lives and Randy Bryce isn't alone in facing that sort of attack and Arizona Republican Congressman Paul goats are six siblings filmed an ad against him this election year as well\n... Jones goes and goes or Jennifer ... char pogo stars my brother my brother and I endorsed Dr ... doctor bill wholeheartedly\nGoats are responded to that ad by calling his siblings disgruntled Hillary

an hour and a half like shorter Thanksgiving dinner and twenty sixteen than in twenty Fifteen\nTend to the more political ads that ran the shorter the family dinners got and perhaps unsurprisingly the

I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor take them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this was a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring jobs back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite for right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents do you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nAll

instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly you have people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and bomb not letting them and\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty or for ... or from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group\nAh there's no evidence then of Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any [noise]\nMan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group\nOr there's no evidence then of Middle Eastern infiltration the

Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota law requiring voter id to include street addresses has also gotten attention\n... considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities\nShe's the head of an why use Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I answer about how voting laws have changed over the last decade our\nCountry has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we'd say states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of ideas in order to be able to cast a ballot that will count we're seeing states\nNot providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurchase has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty\nWe have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted and to intervene cycles or look we're not sure if this person still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late\nUm critically we're also seeing that purging is happening in states that used to\nBe required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election processes we're not going to be discriminatory and we're saying that those areas are having an even higher increasing the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling is voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest laws\nHave been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a enacted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nUm many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote surprised her very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way or that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place\n[noise] you know ... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections projects thank you for speaking with all things
