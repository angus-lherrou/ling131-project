Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro it looked like North America will remain a free trade zone after all late last night Canada agreed to joined the U.S and Mexico in an updated version of the north American free trade agreement it will no longer be called NAFTA but rather the U. S. M. C. A. NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nPresident Trump has long railed against NAFTA calling at one of the worst trade deal ever negotiate it but in the White House Rose Garden this morning Trump's celebrated what was billed as a new and improved trade deal Trump called it a positive step for both the country and the world\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement and the history of our country with the most advanced protections for workers ever develop\nIn signing on to the deal Canada agreed to open up bits long protected dairy market at least a little bit Trump says that means new opportunity for American dairy producers to sell their products north of the border including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few I Want to be very specific\nBut Canada is still expected to buy more than Ninety percent of its dairy products from Canadian suppliers former U.S agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack who now heads the dairy export council says the new deal is an improvement for American dairy farmers but not by much\nWe're looking at an incremental increase in excess were not certainly looking at a an opening why do the market but we are seeing an increase\nMore importantly perhaps the agreement is designed to prevent Canadian dairy farmers from dumping surplus skim milk powder on the world market at what the us views as artificially low prices\nIn exchange for these concessions the U. S. agreed not to scrap NAFTA Arab process for resolving trade disputes even though Trump wanted to preserving that arbitration process was a top priority for Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau\nWhen you're trading partner is ten times your size you need rules you need a level playing field\nThe U.S and Mexico had reached a tentative trade deal more than a month ago but Canada didn't agree to sign on until late last night just hours before a White House deadline Walter do cautions there are still hoops to jump through before the deal is finalized the threat of a trade agreement that left Canada on the sidelines has been averted\nWhat I can say is that free and fair trade in North America isn't much more stable place than it was yesterday\nMarkets rallied on the news with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining nearly two hundred points Trump Trudeau and Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto are expected to sign the deal within sixty days just before opinion that leaves office it will then be up to the incoming U.S Congress to decide whether to approve the agreement\nWork [noise]\nAnd one of the law school for the Kansas news service and see the these jets in

written about chaos and [noise]\nAnd NPR News\nThis is all things considered I Know they can and I'm Ari Shapiro there have been a lot of books written about chaos and dysfunction in the Trump White house the latest book by Michael Lewis looks lower down the food chain and parts of the government that don't get as much attention like the department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book it's called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story is pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people time\nCreating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and\nNice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up well\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about so the department\nOf energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they stockpile is overseen in the department energy\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election no one shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packed up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThat Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of lobbyists who when they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leave\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example\nStart to turn up inside of the department\nBut they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nHey ... from their especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside the department of commerce there at the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades gotten extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane and tornado forecasts\nThe weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts the person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it\nThis is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path of dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investment in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in his administration and the way it's running the government\nThat it's looking for a loss of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal they do with their conscience is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term\n[noise] or these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit or so and those are people who have made a career out of the people who really know\nReally know the jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump still haven't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government\nSo there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended this book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named ... Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that barn I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that no well\nFirst let's explain why mistakenly wanted airborne going ah her husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined ... active destruction would come and kind of ease or paying she wouldn't have to stare at the barn any longer\nAnd which he doesn't imagine is that with the same tornado that's going to come take her barn is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that\nAnd I thought it was kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine or how their imaginations worker how the human imagination works\n... imagines the destruction it wants it imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government it doesn't imagine all the collateral damage he doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do and I think this failure of the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael Lewis his new book is the fifth respects for two and a half [noise]\nTomorrow on MORNING edition California Governor

term today and it did so with only eight justices Republicans had hoped to see judge Kavanaugh in time for the new term of course that did not happen\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg without the court today and has this report\nThat they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government\nAt the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deals but inevitably he faced Kavanaugh questions\nAmong them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president a sure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed to the court\nThe president never really answered the question was you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support Kavanaugh unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stretching the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations for taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices back then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year\nBut back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court\nNow he has a retired so today for the first time in well over Thirty years there was no justice like Kennedy or Sandra Day O'Connor both appointed by President Reagan\nWho sits ideologically at the center of the court and today the liberal conservative split was a parent and the first case to be argued a challenge to a regulation under the endangered species act\nThe central player in the case is the ... go for a frog which sounds a bit like this [noise]\n\nThis species lived in only one place in Mississippi and is in danger of becoming extinct when the ephemeral pond that it lives and breathes in is gone a federal ponds dry out periodically and have no fish so the frogs legs don't get eaten\nAt issue in the frogs case is whether the fish and Wildlife Service can designate an area in Louisiana where the frogs once lived as a critical habitat so that\nAt some point in the future the frogs maybe move back to this area where there are more ephemeral ponds warehouse or the timber company which leases land has challenged the designation as a potential threat to any future development plans\nAfter the argument on the steps of the court Noah Greenwald the endangered species director at the center for biological diversity\nExplains why Congress enacted the endangered species act in the first place\nWeb of life that we ourselves depend on is built of species you know you go systems are made of\nIn the first place the Web of life that we ourselves depend on it was built of species you know you'd go systems are made of species we all depend on species for food for medicines for clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language and the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one and the court for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is\nA four to four time would mean the lower court ruling stays in place meaning warehouse or loses\nHow fast the court gets a ninth justice depend on how quickly the Senate can hop along [noise]\nNina Totenberg NPR News Washington

are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problem was were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces are empty and nice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later\nI'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person [noise] there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up well\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at a place like the department of energy but you write about so the\nOf energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean the the stockpile is overseeing in the department of energy [noise]\nSo they're shock there when the day after election no one shows up and they're shocked when the guy who was in charge of the nuclear weapons tax up his boxes and goes on\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election no one shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons tax up as boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThat Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leave\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department but they the people the outgoing people\nGenerally had the impression that\nHey there's ... from ... didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign just interest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency it's supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside the department of commerce there's the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades gotten extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane and tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upsides ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investments in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme and his administration and the way it's running the government\nThat it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal to do with their conscious is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term [noise]\nOr these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after for eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit or so and those are people who made a career out of ... people who really know\nReally know the jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump still haven't filled half\nOf the top seven hundred jobs in his own government so there's been a drink\nAnd on top of that Trump still haven't filled half\nOf the top seven hundred jobs in his own government so there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named miss Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that note well\nFirst let's explain why miss family wanted airborne going ah her husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined this act of destruction would come and kind of ease or pain she wouldn't have to stare at the bar and any longer\nAnd which he doesn't imagine is with the same tornado that's going to come take her board is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that\nAnd I thought it was a kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine or how their imaginations worker how the human imagination works\n... imagines the destruction it wants it imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government it doesn't imagine all the collateral damage she doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do and I think this failure\nOf the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael Lewis his new book is the fifth rich thanks for joining us today\nTomorrow on

Supreme Court continues the court began a new term today and it did so it was only eight justices Republicans had hoped to see judge Kavanaugh in time for the new term of course that did not happen\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg without the court today and has this report\nThat they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government\nAt the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deal but\nInevitably he faced Kavanaugh questions among them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president a sure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed to the court\nThe president never really answered the question well you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you he's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support Kavanaugh unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place that Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices back then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year\nBut back then Justice Anthony Kennedy uh concerts\nCan leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year but back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court\nNow he has a retired so today for the first time in well over Thirty years there was no justice like Kennedy or Sandra Day O'Connor both appointed by President Reagan\nWho sits ideologically at the center of the court and today the liberal conservative split was a parent in the first case to be argued\nA challenge to a regulation under the endangered species act\nThe central player in the case is the ... go for a frog which sounds a bit like this [noise]\n\nThis species lived in only one place in Mississippi and is in danger of becoming extinct when the ephemeral pond that it lives and breathes in is gone\nA federal ponds dry out periodically and have no fish so the frogs legs don't get eaten at issue in the ... case is whether the fish and Wildlife Service can designate an area in Louisiana where the frogs once lived as a critical habitat so that\nAt some point in the future the frogs maybe move back to this area where there are more ephemeral ponds warehouse or the timber company which leases land has challenged the designation as a potential threat to any future development plant\nAfter the argument on the steps of the court Noah Greenwald the endangered species director at the center for biological diversity\nExplained why Congress enacted the endangered species act in the first place\nThe Web of life that we ourselves depend on if built of species you know you go through customs are made of species we all depend on species for food for medicines for clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language and the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one\nAnd the court for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is afforded for time would mean the lower court ruling stays in place meaning warehouse or loses\nHow fast the court gets a ninth justice depends on how quickly the Senate can hop along\n[noise] Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington [noise]\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News ...\nMaybe ... leaders I'm Jane order from dodge city

interestingly as the book was about ... efforts as an only child to care for her parents as they age well into their nineties then died the title suggests one of the challenges and caring for parents just seeing that they need our attention and care\nIsn't isn't that the crux of it all\nA year or so ago my uncle and has late eighties sold his car we're not sure why but we think and driving it he had a scare of some kind and almost accident or maybe he found himself momentarily last disoriented in a community he lived in almost all of his eighty plus years\nAnyway he sold the car and he got a pretty good price for it\nYou can bet we were relieved mostly because his having made the decision meant we didn't have to\nBut then almost immediately after he deposited the Chuck he regretted selling the car he smoked for months even now he says he misses it which\nBetween you and me that he misses that car is pretty hard to believe I mean it was a relic expensive to maintain and the heat or only worked when I was Ninety degrees out\nBut of course it's not the car he misses so much as he misses the mobility it gave him a sense of being able to choose where and when to go to go
