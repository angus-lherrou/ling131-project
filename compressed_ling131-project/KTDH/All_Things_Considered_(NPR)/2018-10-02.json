hi or tell us more about Jason Kander a Democrat with deep appeal in a deep red state\nRight as he's a lawyer he was a former Missouri secretary of state he did a tour in Afghanistan as an intelligence officer\nBack in two thousand six and then came home and got into Missouri politics he made a surprisingly good run in a deep red state to unseat Republican senator Roy Blunt and two thousand uh sixteen and if you've heard of him you've probably heard of him from this ad\nOn Jason Kansas senator born in front of me\nAnd he's in an empty warehouse blindfolded and he's assembling a are Fifteen style rifle and the while he's doing he's talking about gun rights and he says he supports gun ... supports gun rights but he also support background checks\nHe says to keep terrorists from getting one of these and then the gun is assembled and he takes off the blindfold and he says\nHe's I'd like to see some of the barn through this\nAnd the ad gone national attention I later I had a best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really it seemed like a rising politician of the Democratic\nParty and his decision today to part of the race came as a surprise that came with a very honest and emotional let her message or tell us about it\nRight it was just hours ago it candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem\nThat he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago\nUm he said that when he should have been celebrating for example or having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in ... in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line to Vietnam veterans crisis line in tears saying that yes he had been having suicidal thoughts\nUm so he decided that he should take a step back from the campaign and from the organization he started to something called the let America vote which is a anti gerrymandering an anti voter suppression organization or he says he's getting VIP treatment\nAnd that he's not permanently retiring from politics he's expecting to be back\nEven with all of a conversation about and support for people who have ... how much stigma is there still today\nWell I mean there's a lot of stigma and and it can also depend for example on what stage are out in the military career if you're active duty military and you raise your hand and get treatment it can make you under deployable so a lot a lot of people will hide it because they want to be able to stay in the fight\n'em and uh I mean I Can't think of a politician who's disclosed is sort of thing except usually on the you know\nOn the tail of a scandal that's going to come out involving some uh misbehavior but uh I mean this is a serious crisis just last week the VA release

violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nTo execute a convicted murderer who has such severe dementia that he doesn't remember the crime he committed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports\nVernon Madison committed a terrible crime in Nineteen eighty five after leaving his girlfriend's house he returned and shot and killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection twice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct\nThe third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows the trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dimension\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this prime things about the state to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he had just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison lawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plots be\nAnswer brain damage that is the result of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past just to sit on my or\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia it's so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself or his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely urine aids on himself and asked the guards to take him to the toilet\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said is not like the constitutions other amendment it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's schizophrenia or delusional\nThink of a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who gets a frantic are delusional\nLawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime and he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murder after the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder and at some point in time that they look forward to being able to obtain the punishment that the trial judge Lee was appropriate in this case\nA decision in the case is expected later in the term Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Nobel Prize in physics

S. and they're linked to a number of illnesses including cancer the Trump Administration is working on a plan to regulate them some in Congress are pressing for it to move faster\nNPR's Jeff Brady has been looking into this and joins us now Jeff\nHi Ari first of all what are these chemicals or pee fast it's an entire group of several thousand manmade chemicals in some of them had been around for decades these chemicals are good at Republican oil and water and that makes them really useful for all sorts of products like non stick cookware holdings on fast food rappers pizza boxes\nAnd the places where Pete passes are used in manufacturing those are generally the places that are the most polluted or there's some sites in New York North Carolina Michigan just to name a few places\n... also are in firefighting phone used at airports and military bases in some cases around the country the chemicals have migrated into local drinking water and the estimates on exactly how many people are affected very but it's safe to say that the numbers and the million how harmful to people can these chemicals be what kinds of problems that cause\nThe research is limited so it's hard to pin down exactly how harmful these chemicals are a scientist will say ... are linked to certain illnesses here's Laurel ... he's a research scientist with an advocacy group called the Silent Spring Institute\n... chemicals have been linked to a wide range of health effects including cancer\nLow birth weight\nThyroid disease elevated cholesterol an effect\nOn the immune system manufacturers have agreed to stop using two forms of pee fast in the U. S. but these chemicals take a long time to break down in the environment and that's why they are still a problem now and how regulators responding to this especially given the uncertainty\nThe EPA requires most water utilities to test for a list of ... passes and in twenty sixteen agency lowered a non binding health advisory limit for some ... chemicals it's now Seventy parts per trillion I'm told that it's about Seventy grains of sand and an Olympic size swimming pool\nAnd some environmental advocates argue level should be even lower than that\nBut all this uncertainty it creates confusion especially for water companies like aqua America it's based in suburban Philadelphia\nChristopher Crockett is the chief environmental officer there and he says companies like his needs clearer direction from the EPA and from policymakers to be able to explain to the public and my above or below sea level here and do we need to put treatment on in this community and how soon\nAnd that still needs to be determined and that needs to be determined as soon as possible now the EPA is working on a plan to manage pee fast chemicals the agency just wrapped up a series of public meetings around the country the plan is expected by the end of the year the Trump in ministry\nIs working on a plan to manage the fast chemicals the agency just wrapped up a series of public meetings around the country the plan is expected by the end of the year\nThe Trump Administration has been so staunchly anti regulation especially rolling back protections meant to keep people safe from environmental contaminants why are they responding differently today\nAn issue like this you'd really fits in with the way the Trump Administration has tried to narrow the focus of the EPA away from things like climate change and toward issues such as clean air and clean water also we should keep in mind that the EPA still working on his plan to manage be fast chemicals\nAnd we don't know what the plan is going to look like until it's out some time in the next few months so what could people do to protect themselves today well the water utility aqua that we heard from just a minute ago they've installed these big carbon filters to bring the levels down and that works the utility says the water is safe to drink\nIf you're still worried about it those filters that you get in a refrigerator or water pitchers those will bring the levels down too\nBut I've talked to people here who still just don't trust their water that it's safe and they're continuing to drink bottled water\nThat's NPR's Jeff Brady thanks thank you are and tomorrow we'll visit a New Hampshire town where there's concern that these chemicals are leaking from landfill into drinking water

that said oh it's not lost hope that some policies can have an impact at least near the margins\nNow to the planes first up is Republican Kris Kobach his one big idea is to minimize regulations and cut income property in sales tax is much like what was done six years ago he's credited that sort of action taken by the Trump Administration for the growing national economy\nAll all users along the way I'm going to go to\nDan recommend is a professor of economics at Oklahoma State University He's done extensive research on the impacts of tax policy on state and local economies including looking specifically at the tax cuts when Sam Brownback was governor\nI expected you you're going to get just more the same result of you know we we've done some analysis\nSpecifically at the tax cuts when Sam Brownback was governor\nAre expected to you're going to get to more the same result of you know we we've done some analysis Simpson and other states and we're funding for similar answer so the most states that have the dramatic which are taxes are underperform what you would've expected they would have\nHe says the evidence here in Kansas and around the country just doesn't support the use of state tax cuts to spur economic growth\nIs you're going to gain some Turks go to the very carefully uh understanding and figure out where you can get the trucks without hurting programs that are

education is a good start\nI feel like doing things like investing in schools and human capital feels like it as a pretty big bang for the buck\nBut she says the details about that investment matter\nYou know if I was a state like Kansas I Would think about what kinds of industries have some advantage for being there and what kind of employees are needed and how can we improve our school system and our higher education to meet those needs\nBut money for those kinds of investments must come from somewhere namely taxpayers finally we've reached the one big idea from independent Greg Orman he thinks Kansas should invest more in transportation infrastructure\nI you know the evidence of this year and I say we should be an old ... ... America\nAre hall says that could help maybe\nHere's one way to think about it if you did not have any road building one road would probably have a very large economic impact but if you have lots of roads one more road is probably not going to have much of an economic impact\nBasically you don't want infrastructure that's crumbling spending more on the margins isn't likely to have a huge impact on economic growth here's the enrichment again\nJust building roads doesn't necessarily solve anything because you need to keep them um maintained and developed in places where they are heavily used or just assume things education of these things often very much for more growth\nUltimately all three economist agreed that stimulating economic growth on a statewide level is hard for politicians to do and it's a lot more complicated than simply raising or lowering taxes for the Kansas news service I'm Brian grim it in Wichita\nKansas news service is a collaboration covering health education and politics across the state\n\nIt's five forty eight central time this is high plains public radio made possible by support from listeners like you I'm Angie ... and you're tuned into our afternoon news magazine all things considered coming up news from across the region\nThis is Angie have fully and you're listening to high plains public radio delivering news and information that expands your knowledge if you want to help grow this amazing community of listeners give today at H.

Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment to execute a convicted murderer who has such severe dementia that he doesn't remember the crime he committed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports\nVernon Madison committed a terrible crime in Nineteen eighty five after leaving his girlfriend's house he returned and shot and killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection twice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because a prosecutorial misconduct\nThe third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffered from severe vascular dimension\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison it's so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking in slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of circumstances of this crime or things of that but they seem to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment in the past two decks\nThe justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who become psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the result of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past ... or\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dimension it's so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself for his views\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely urinate on himself and asks the guards to take him to the toilet [noise]\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said it's not like the constitutions other amendment it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who gets a frantic are delusional\nLawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime\nAnd he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murdered after the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder\nAnd at some point in time to say look forward to being able to obtain the punishment that the trial judge believe was appropriate in this case\nA decision in the case is expected later in
