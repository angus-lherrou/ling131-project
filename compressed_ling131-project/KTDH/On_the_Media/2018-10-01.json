throw sand in the gas tank of democracy because\nWe're doing that ourselves systematically and increasingly for more than a century and we've been doing it by keeping people from voting\nThis past summer the Brennan Center for justice released a new report on voter purges it documented sixteen million voters removed from the rolls between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen almost four million more than were removed\nBetween two thousand and six and two thousand and eight and the areas with the most dramatic calling\nExactly the regions that until twenty thirty\nWe're doing that ourselves systematically and increasingly for more than a century and we've been doing it by keeping people from voting\nThis past summer the Brennan Center for justice released a new report on voter purges\nIt documented sixteen million voters removed from the rolls between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen almost four million more than were removed between two thousand and six and two thousand and eight and the areas with the most dramatic calling\nExactly the regions that until twenty Thirteen were so historically unfair to eligible black voters that the voting rights act subjected them to pre clearance from the Justice Department\nPre cleared means that any changes that that state or that county we're going to make in their voting laws had to be okayed by the U.S department of justice or the federal courts before that change was made\nCarol Anderson is a professor of history at Emory University and author of one person no vote a voter suppression is destroying or democracy she says that the previous law the Nineteen fifty seven civil rights act had been insufficient to deal with the disenfranchisement of black voters in the south\nBy the time that the u._s. was fighting the Nazis only three percent of African American adults were registered to vote in the south\nThe state's implemented new laws new purchases and the civil rights act couldn't deal with it the voting rights act could\nBecause of pre clearance because these states could not implement a law then run elections based on this franchise meant have politicians who had been elected because of ... who are crafting new just franchising laws the voting rights act really short circuit it that\nThese jurisdictions had been caught red handed and were required to pass federal muster before enforcing any of these rules intended to suppress the vote which they claimed was an onerous burden and by the twenty first century no longer necessary\nBecause they've cleaned up their act and in Shelby County versus holder the Supreme Court agreed with\nThe county commissioners and Shelby County Alabama and be gone and accessing vast parcels of land around Calera city\nAll of this without getting pre cleared by the department of justice so they're violating federal law\nThere had been one lone black city councilman in ... city the lone black councilman moved from a district where he was going to get elected to a district where over Seventy percent of the residents had voted against Iraq Obama\nIn the next election after all of this redistricting Calera city no longer even had one black councilman\nAnd the Justice Department sued Shelby County saying it was in violation of the pre clearance requirements in the voting rights act\nAnd the U.S Supreme Court with chief justice John Roberts writing an opinion of four or five four decision\nSaid that one racism was no longer the kind of prevalent force that it had been that gave rise to the need for the voting rights act he pointed to black elected officials Hispanic elected officials\nThe increase in black voter turnout and he said so it's clear that racism is just not operating in the United states at least not at that kind of high level and he said that the voting rights act\nDidn't take into account the changing dynamics of America\nLet's just say that the Roberts five four majority was the case of premature Rick ...\nForce that it had been that gave rise to the need for the voting rights act he pointed to black elected officials Hispanic elected officials\nThe increase in black voter turnout and he said so it's clear that racism is just not operating in the United states at least not at that kind of high level and he said that the voting rights act\nDidn't take into account the changing dynamics of America\nLet's just say that the Roberts far for majority was the case of premature recalculate from above the level of racism in the electoral process\nComes now the burning numbers which shows that the voter purge of suppressing the black vote is highest in precisely the places where the court decision let the stress strict rooms off the hook in other words they went right back to their former practices\nYou hit it head on we had every indication of this we had Alabama in two thousand and eleven that passed voter id law\nNow when Alabama was working on this law the Republicans recorded themselves talking and they said we need to figure out how to depress the black voter turnout\nAnd then all of the racism pours out you're going to have all of these aborigines and these illiterates getting on these hut finance buses and going to the polls\nAnd so they crafted a voter ID laws targeted at African Americans to depress the vote but that was in two thousand eleven before Shelby County beholder\nImmediately after Shelby County beholder\nBoom Alabama begins to implement that law the same with Texas and so these states we're just poised they had these laws drafted ready to go\nAnd the purging was a key piece of it here in Georgia our secretary of state Brian Kemp who's now running for governor has a program called exact match\nWhat exact match does is it says that your voter registration card has to exactly match what in the bureau of motor vehicles database say you have a driver's license or or from the Social Security office\nNow where that gets dicey is say that your name is hyphenated um Garcia hyphen Marquez and you hyphenated\nWhen you write it for your voter registration card but say on your driver's license in the driver's license database there's not\nA hyphen they're not having a hyphen\nGets you kicked out of your voter registration and your voter registration is denied\nNo it's not just purchase of the voter rolls through there's many other classic tools to voter suppression I just want to make the point that this is not some sort of new development\nHas a long sinister sordid history in Eighteen Ninety during the rise of Jim Crow the state of Mississippi was trying to figure out how do we stop black people from voting and they devised what was called the Mississippi plant\nSuch as the poll tax where you have to pay in order to vote such as the literacy tests where you had to read sections of the constitution of the state constitution or the U.S constitution\nAnd interpret it to the liking of the registrar such as the white primary we're only whites could vote in the Democratic primary the grandfather clause the good character clause\nThat was an array of devices that created a package of this franchise meant targeted at the black population they couldn't just say we don't want black people to vote\nWhere you had to pay in order to vote such as the literacy tests where you had to read sections of the constitution of the state constitution or the U.S constitution\nAnd interpret it to the liking of the registrar such as the white primary we're only whites could vote in the Democratic primary the grandfather clause the good character clause\nThat was an array of devices that created a package of disenfranchisement targeted at the black population they couldn't just say we don't want black people to vote because there was this thing called the fifteenth amendment to the constitution\nBut they're Michelle we run into political and bureaucratic dysfunction tell me how\nThe federal election commission late now barely has a Corum it's supposed to have sex can missionary\nTo vote on matters to decide whether to enforce the law enforced regulation holds groups accountable as a running afoul of\nThe law or regulation but the refugee right now only had four commissioners which is the bare minimum vote you need in order to do anything before commission either split along ideological line\nTwo of them are Republican or Democrat so it's very difficult for work to get done there and this has been the case\nFor a while now the FCC now needs to come up with a brand new regulation\nWhich takes months to write and then it has to go up for public comment period which is probably another month or two and then it has to come before Congress for at least a month or so there's a long way to go I tell some clear guidelines that get in on the other side the iris has really chosen\nTo protect the donors identity is rather than to disclose their identities and visit the way the Irish and they're moving recently because they believe that there's too much room for error that there have been weeks of donors who did not want to be disclosed\nSo the IRS has moved away from disclosure so it's really unlikely that these government agencies or not do anything and time to make a huge difference for the midterm strongly\nEven in time to make a real difference next year\nAnd let's say in some fantasy world both the federal election commission and the IRS do pass some explicit rules governing five but once we force and\nA similar category fiber once the sixes\nIf we know anything from history it's the political money adopts if you're a political high roller and rules change you know you're going to find a new way to donate if you run the show yeah he political action committee what would be your next move\nSo if I let them Michele ... social welfare nonprofit I as a non profit and say\nTo a donor could you give me some money to help flip the Senate and then I Will use your money\nIn whatever way it take to get there\nSo these terrorists are now changing the way that they're asking on his money they might be asking you generally support what I support as a group please give us money and then maybe they'll try to use the money for a political pep that it's it's really unclear thoughts allowed but that's one creative way that the groups might start doing it\nAnother way that the ... and I started operating is that they might give it to unaffiliated superPAC so I asked him to shall geeky we nonprofit group\nKick the donation and then I make a donation to a superPAC instead that way the superPAC only the schools has been non profit that gave the money and the ... the nonprofit\nAnd would not have to disclose any like donors who gave the money to the nonprofit suicide\nThey use the money for a political pep that it's it's really unclear thoughts allowed but that's one creative way that the groups might start doing it\nAnother way that the ... and they start operating is that they might give it to unaffiliated superPAC so I as a Michelle geeky we nonprofit groups\nTake the donation and then I make a donation to a superPAC instead that way the superPAC only that schools has been non profit that gave the money and the ... the nonprofit\nAnd would not have to disclose any like the owners who gave the money to the nonprofit so it's actually adding one more layer between the identity of the donor and whatever what triggered the disclosure of that person's identity\nAlso known as money laundering\nThat that's what some critics my call that I wouldn't aren't than objective reporter call it that\nIf there is a change in the uh the political donor ecosystem at what point do you think the status quo will change by the twenty twenty presidential election for example\nAlthough it's not officially in ... and we may not see\nAny sort of official change in behavior for them to turn it's already started altering behavior of John areas and superPACs and nonprofits the groups that I've spoken to let that donors that I've spoken with has been aware\nOf the possible change coming down the pike and when the lower court ruling came down in early August had actually put a lot of youth groups on alert so they have been scrambling to figure out what their\nBig old council what this means for their fundraising for twenty eight Jean what they should be telling that John or how they should change the script for asking for donations\nAnd donors are already asking about what does this mean for me how early can my identity disclosed to the public that's actually changed a lot of behaviors already\nLet me ask you one less thing however this plays out it still seems to me like a surprising decision by a Roberts' court Citizens United court\nTo lead stands is lower court decision the complicated life for political donors can we divine anything about this situation beyond its particulars\nThere's very little to read into the way to the Supreme Court reacted here because we don't know why that happened we don't know why they're that's because the other justices deadlocked for four on this or whether they just wanted to go through the full appeals process\nWe just have no idea what is interesting about that certainly in the context that judge Kavanaugh's nomination\nIs that after this case goes through appeal it could come back before the Supreme Court and\nIs there is a justice Kavanaugh who is not a fan of don't aren't as good or or campaign finance speculation it's a really make a huge impact and the ... campaign finance
