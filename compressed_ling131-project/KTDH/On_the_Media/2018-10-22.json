week Warren responded by way of a five and a half minute ... campaign video and she speaks with car loans bustamante a Stanford genetics professor who examine to DNA and the hunger\nGenomes did five five segment of the Native American ancestry with very high confidence [laughter] we have a Native American ancestry and you're better\nThe response was probably not what Warren had anticipated she came out and thought she scored at first and so to the media\nAnd they sort of the men and got old Trump pay off the million dollar bet at all of a sudden now she is at war with the Cherokee Nation\nSaying that are used to be in a test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests from both right and the last appropriate accusations that she's not native enough that she is reinforcing biological essential Islam\nThat she's falling for a Trump trap before the midterms that she's trying to claim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her\nTo bolster its diversity bottom sides\nA political miscalculation but also a stun into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere's a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother a Cherokee princess and their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they said oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nKim tall ... professor of native studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us has a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand Elizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer is I don't mean to sound cliche\nBut everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual land and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe\nOr not govern so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry we have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe now in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA and ever since talk of blood is\nLineage and fate have given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest at the same time there are old metaphors that persist\nYou can still be related to either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk plays out in native culture\nCaution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you weren't looking as tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors but dogs allotment act at the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land to heads of households and of course only men and settler ideas a family at the time to be has a ...\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities\nTo be has counseled they would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments you had to have a register of Indians well tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities and didn't necessarily have lists\nWith names of their people and their can these are fluid kinship groups right but now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment as governor and what we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base role you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds yeah\nWhen you see on the back of my traveling rolling card that I'm One thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and Rob a whole blood quote unquote\nIs my grandfather Randy tall there it's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were\nFor us it's who is your mom who's your grandmother who's your great grandfather who your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the system walked in ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base role but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient they will accept the blood\nThere's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining around the whole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly thirteenth thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that because her father's non native now if my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple\nOf cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got\nYou know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down\nTo want it and I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards lineage dissent rules to try to make our rules more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonized we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power words severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with\nThe Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore [noise] do you think that she just got played into a discussion of race\nAnd and blood then the women then this is something ... she got some set in the New Yorker you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his times you know\nI don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody\nOut in order to defend herself against his times you know\nI don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren ... I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma and the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nLived with this mess of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people she's probably really invested in defending her family story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nYou know certainly for African Americans even though there's very much a historical and understandable desire to\nBe able to lay claim to identities that are not just about race have cast mhm it's also the case that particularly in a place like the United states and twenty eight team that's deeply polarized and becoming\nDeeply racialized no one is making find distinctions in the workplace and the housing market between forms of African ethnicity or whether or not someone is deemed to be just black or white and what those racial identity is experience as they are entitled people to or don't entitle people too in\nThe world Alondra thank you very much it's a pleasure to speak with uber Alondra Nelson is president of the social science\nDo people too in the world Alondra thank you very much\nIt's a pleasure to speak with uber Alondra Nelson is president of the social science Research Council professor of sociology at Columbia University and author of the social life of DNA race reparations and reconciliation after that you know [noise]\n\nI mean another application of genetic research and another kind of controversy twins to seize on me [laughter] on the\nMedia is supported by target presenting future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing and communities nationwide future retirees\nAvailable on apple pie cats or wherever pond caster found\nTwo and a half weeks before election day survey after survey shows healthcare is the issue voters care about most and Missouri Senate race has boiled down to a debate over covering preexisting conditions I Would never dream dusty answer they're taking away some of the\nMost popular things that the Affordable CARE Act did I'm saying let's start over all the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\nMonday morning beginning at five central [noise]\nHello\nMy name is Amy Kaufman from Amarillo, Texas and I'm a proud member of high plains public radio\n\nNPR in general and especially H. P. P. R. has introduced me to so many artists\nThat I wouldn't have known about if I were just listening to mainstream radio so that's been a real gift\n\nThis is on the media I'm Brooke Gladstone the double helix structure of ... rival nucleic acid or DNA was discovered just sixty five years ago but mankind has been playing with the notion of what makes us who we are for millennia\nTwins especially played a prominent role in ancient mythology of the founders of Rome remiss and Rami list twin brothers raised by a giant wolf caster and pilots have twin brothers who's Gemini forms

this summer three identical strangers tells the story of triplets David Eddie and Bobby adopted by three different families and studied under highly unusual circumstances spoilers I head\nThey separated these voices [noise] the parents\nHad never been told that there were two other children what was the top ... how could you not [noise] they're trying to conceal what they did from the people who did it when you play with him and she just housing very easy to come up with all the was\nThe secret study orchestrated by psychologist Peter New Bauer sought to examine how three distinct parenting styles might shape identical triplets weird apart not until the boys met by chance at age Nineteen did they learn how their lives have been manipulated for a trove of data\nThat remains largely locked away and an archive at Yale\nAccording to Dr Nancy ... the director of the twin studies center at California State University at full attend the unreal these study would likely inconclusive and definitely cruel\nWell I I think this was a very unethical study keep in mind that even though in those times the practice was that you don't encourage contact but nevertheless\nThese children were never told they were twins and most of his adoptive parents who are hungry for children would have gladly taken too so to not tell people this very important aspect of their\nBackground I think is just horrendous it's really beyond my comprehension and I did because being a twin is a very important part of one's identity ones knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked\nWith hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart just how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years together\nTwin studies often capture the public imagination but none quite like not says twin study which tracked the genetic profiles of two astronaut brothers one who'd spent a year in space while a twin lived on earth the media had a field day with this Scott\nKelly and Mark Kelly are the only identical twin astronaut in history but following DNA altering space mission they may not be identical anymore\nOr your faith had already made got two inches taller than his brother ... seven percent of Scott's James or not return to normal after he returned from years ago so they're no longer\nIdentical twins as space travel altered genetic expression it did not ultimately and they physically itself\nWhen he returned to earth the vast majority of his genetic material to return to the way it was initially\nSee this is a fascinating finding because white identical twins differ in the expression of some traits that we need to find out I think it'll fascinate your listeners to know that if you take diseases like schizophrenia\nOr multiple sclerosis or diabetes you'd expect that the correlation should be about one they have the same genes but it's close to the forty fifty percent something has to trigger the expression in one and keep it quiet and the other end identical twins where it apart or identical twins who different some white\nAnd help us find these environmental effects that might help us control and managed disease\n[noise] you've profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life history is\nExtreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life histories of two sets identical male twins were born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city\nAnd the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north but one of those little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital\nSo his grandmother brought him down to Bogota at the same hospital as he got the twins were born\nAnd somehow an amazing twist of fate got exchange with one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later so they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated\nAnd they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota and somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other I went to Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life history is amazing\nThe one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north\nSo even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On the
