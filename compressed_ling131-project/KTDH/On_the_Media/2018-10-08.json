heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yet the browns Nineteen Seventy classic very my heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history\nEver published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies\nI read that book when I was in college I was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me\nAnd and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety I start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed\nIf you ever happened to travel through modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I Hope by reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised un held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota was nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas when to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal sufferers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it\nI was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair\nI thought that the brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate missed the point when did me was a low point we had withstood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families\nSo by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done and since that point we've been doing\nSo many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms Toni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns book came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared it Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands\nSuddenly thrust Indians in to the national spotlight the declared it Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with a Caucasian and having us this land nearby off the following treated real purchase ... for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar island about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of do from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nThis is we got down there the whole the whole court was covered with a FBI agents right they all had rifles and shotguns and and they and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians let a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nThe curve and was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that the takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued\nWas in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means\nWho was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWas it really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government\nThey one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had been dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing in timber and mineral leases among other things\nThe government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it but then the people who are in the ... the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself and the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ...\nOne of Nixon's guys back man even then agreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took\nNone of at sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering and injustice\nThat is right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time the currents that we have to violence in order to be hurt [noise] I don't want to\nSee him when he killed the times come violence who might have to be committed [noise]\nThere'd been a number of very high profile murders of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge and in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm and people were were frustrated\nWith tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who were murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or misdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd sell for Seventy one days and\nThings like second degree manslaughter or misdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd so for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded knee was under siege\n[noise]\nEnter a serpent and fourteen Ninety two expelled from the garden to wander the earth and shame in poverty right [laughter] did you have that one already south right you've heard that story too you know so often we think of Indian life as lives that are defined by\nHaving everything stolen from us Indian lives our lives of loss that's how our lives are most often understood and I think a better narrative is to think of our lives is is full of plenty\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity
