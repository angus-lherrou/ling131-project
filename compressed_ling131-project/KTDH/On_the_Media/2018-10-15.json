of new thing people a lot of people living in a place altogether needing some kind of system of coordination so that they can all continue to live together in a sort of settled community where the population size it's getting to the point where I Can't keep track of who everyone is anymore\nAnd we start to see centralized systems\nTo help people keep track of what they owe to whom wait what he's\nDescribing ledgers a system of recording obligations and their payment that's not what they taught us in school we all learned that money was simply an advancement on the earlier barter system

are too dependent upon each other jobs are too highly specialized for us to do business five ... that's why we depend on money as a quick and easy medium of exchange\nOnly problem is says now or no matter what we learned in school the anthropological record offers no evidence up simple barter anywhere in the history\nYeah so the ... story is a an origin story for money that you know has a a very long history Aristotle actually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what\nThe kind of good and bad functions of money could be and in the nineteenth century as economics was becoming professionalized economists picked up this barter origin story\nFor money and kind of set it forth into the world um the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs you might think a ha there it is\nThis is for instance you attack a plated string decorated with calories and other precious objects which was used by the ... people in New guinea to determine and to pay for the exact price of a pig\nThat's barter but but what you're really seeing as part of a much more complex series of relationships that people are engaged in that generally have to do with some pretty serious social concerns concerns over\nBirth over marriage over death over the continuation of a lineage or a tribe where the pig in this case isn't just any old pig being exchanged and I always think of you know Charlotte's Web in this context some\n\nSome pig it's some tickets a special pig that indicates a relationship between families it's not just a commodity that's value can be set by the price mechanism the way that the barter story assumes\nSo how did this barter mythology becomes so nearly universal why is this news to me\nVery often origin stories are serving contemporary interests so if we want to believe that the market as it exists today\nAnd that money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable than something like the barter origin story helps us justify it continued existence helps disabled look you know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of wants which is what economists call that problem when\nYou know I've got fish and you've got apples and you don't want my fish and I don't want your Apple's so it's great to justify current conditions but when you start kind of\nCracking it open and starts at appealing back the layers and realizing that that's not really how it happened in that how it happened was you know actually a lot more interesting in a lot more complicated and involved things like\nRecord keeping accounting systems of measure uh states and early state control and shaping of

have seasonal cycles\nI plant the grain and it takes a while to turn into stuff that I can read and turned into you know do and bread and sheep and goats\nOnly Cav during certain parts of the year you
