and our society is caused by the purpose they fall than an actual reporting of the mainstream media that are for us it was fake news\nHas gotten so bad and hateful and beyond description mainstream

certainly trying to use the caravan to\nRepublican advantage although that's a sort of double edged sword for him because you might make an already enthused democratic\nElectorate more enthusiastic by guest baiting them on that issue and Democrats we now have gotten much more liberal on immigration so I guess the short answer is we just don't know how the electorate is reacting to those things\nSo I I guess one final question does any of this matter or there's still many mine's not made up and up those mine's not made up or they're going to go to the polls in the first place do we have any idea

from NPR News Monday morning beginning if I'm central [noise]\nThis is on the media I Bob Garfield for the past two weeks little was known about the enormous human caravan wending its way toward the U.S Mexico border\nExcept that it was a political bonanza for the Republican Party and remember it's gonna be an election of the caravan you know what I'm Talking about Donald Trump characterized the exodus as a word of would be illegal immigrants\nAbout the surge over unprotected borders to take our jobs flooded communities gang activity and drugs and as a bonus harbor Middle Eastern terrorists\nAnd is now obviously trying to conflate both Middle Eastern fair and illegal immigration and sort of a double racist sandwich when it goes up all the way they think of all Americans in the hands of Mexico Geraldo no never do that as opposed to the truth\nThousands of desperate people many of them women and children in fear of their lives taking advantage of safety in numbers and no need to pay parasitic coyote traffickers yet destined to wait in line for weeks or months to apply for legal political asylum\nSarah ... nose in a freelance reporter traveling with the caravan has written for the Daily Beast about the cruel reality behind the surge of migrants not an invasion or a stun to bait Donald Trump but the desperate reaction to ongoing crisis in Honduras\nSarah welcome to one of the media thank you for having not until the last couple of days we're speaking on Thursday Afternoon it was kind of mysterious how this\nGigantic population of truckers what's so quickly coalesce but we now know more and it begins I guess with a guy named Bartolone Fuentes a leftist former politician in Honduras what was his role in all of this\nWell see I think at that time I started in the second stage at the according HIV are tell though and I'm not going to the skin from that there were other people with ... hair that he's tall installation about it I think up and if I can get in touch with those\nOrganizers you have to live on an experience is that like ... and a great show 'em\nAnd so he got in touch with them their fight it and then he said the posts on these according to tell her what happened was there in many ... people and then there's this news reporter I Wonder if it's nice to watch cable news network called ...\nComing out now I'm going to have you see when I got to be identified hunting or read them up by the grownup Wednesdays and then when I look\nThey are clearly said that he would be paying for it in other costs\nIdentified him as a leader them up by the bonus Wednesdays and then when I look in and they are definitely said that he would be paying for food and other costs for people\nThat are ... you know the guy so I guess every I\nAnd I want but I don't know how to learn and he said yeah he got tons and tons and tons of cause but you know I don't think that sort of the explanation I think it helped\nStart things and get them going but then all of the other factors for white people migrate contribute to why it has to help out in the way that it has and that doesn't take away from the fact that this is an extraordinary amount of people but he definitely credits that positive news report with the initial explosion\nOn a report from HGH here is what ... told you and I'm I'm reading from your story in Honduras the government wants to minimize what people are leaving they know\nThey're going to leave and they want to say that they're doing so because of lives and the opposition not the conditions that they that is the government created this is in line with what the United States is saying that there were false promises being made\nAnd this pro government news program played into that messaging trying to say that there is financing when people really just need to get out\nThere is this right wing media me ... it's actually video of service\nMembers are being paid cash money as the story is told that it's you know George Soros\nMoney or Democratic Party money bribing people had northward to invade or\nBrad wants caravans they liked the caravans are lot of people say I wonder who started the caravan but\nThat has been debunked has it not\nYeah absolutely there's been multiple fact checked on it first day on a busy owned by the New York times like there's absolutely nothing to back up that George tourist is paying any on on the care that\nI Believe that it was local businessmen and it was a very very small amount of money that was passed out to that and that's really not unusual considering\nThe local support that we're seeing for migrants here in Mexico both in the town is once people get there and then along the way they super pass out water banana one for\nMe though yesterday and I would and I

explanation\nExplanation I've seen mostly going around hunters and something that I've seen period by the shade affairs the closest thing to the ambassador to the United states has around hunter is is that it is funded by the opposition of hunter\nAnd that is sort of a political game that people within the country are playing that sort of more the wine that I've been seeing raised\nIn ... which makes sense the country's extremely polarized and then they just had a political crisis last year where there was a razor thin election and the machines counting the votes shut down and when they came

[noise]\nIt's almost comical ... anti trends video but in a remarkable exercise in political hold me up at the the activists on the other side of the question many themselves trans went door to door to share that ad with potential voters\nIt was not a random tactic it emerged based on the work of Stanford professor David Brockman who a few years ago in Florida on another trends related ballot question began applying his research findings to super charge the age old political process of door to door canvassing\nBut just plain talking to the person who answers the door\nA lot of people have skepticism about this kind of approach because they say well there is no way that you could knock on a stranger a store and get them to talk to you much less tell these kinds of stories\nBut when we actually found in the research is that canvassers who had just gone through a simple morning training were able to have conversations where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door how the conversation and told a story from their life so\nI think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if there are approached in such a way from a friendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation with him\nSo once you initiated the perspective having what's the effect the person becomes suddenly more open to other out groups like trends citizens just like clinical\nThe person becomes suddenly more open to other out groups like trends citizens\nJust like clinical trials for medicine where you'd randomly assign patients to a blood pressure pill or a sugar pill we did the same thing in this study where we randomly assigned voters to either get the kind of perspective taking intervention that I mentioned or a control group that got a door knocked about recycling what we find when we do a series of follow up surveys\nThree days three weeks six weeks and three months later is that when we compare the group that we had that conversation with at the door versus the group we could have but did not that treatment group is significantly more\nAccepting of transgender people across a variety of items the average effect is on the order of\nAbout Fifteen percentage points if you had to put it in those terms another way to think about it is that if you look at the change on items\nThat measure attitudes towards gay men and lesbians and the average attitudes in Nineteen Ninety eight and twenty twelve we see a similar effect from these ten twenty minute conversations as we see in the public in general from Nineteen Ninety eight to twenty twelve so that's a really really big\nEffect does this and knock you lay them against political advertising that engages in hateful hot button pressing\nOne thing we actually did and one of the follow up surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment and control groups one of those trends phobic advertisements to say well if we show them these ads it'd be affected the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats into a transfer the corner\nAlthough we do find the ad has some immediate effect we still find a treatment group we campus is much more supportive more over several weeks later it seems as though the effect of the ad has completely ... what we find time again is that the effects of those kinds of mass media advertisements are very ephemeral\n... know doesn't your research fly in the face of academic orthodoxy on the matter of campaigns very\nWe're actually entering the really interesting period which is sort of like when medicine moved from putting leeches on people and telling anecdotes like well I put a leash on Mary and Mary's got better so\nYou should put a leash on yourself to where we are kind of still I Would say in the early days of using these rigorous real world randomized trials that revolutionized medicine so there's different versions of orthodoxy depending on who's a scribe too but my personal view is that we actually just know remarkably little about the real world impacts of this kind of campaign activity\nI don't think our study is going to be the the last word on the matter it's much more like one of the first words on the matter this particular kind of intervention but we're doing lots of follow of work on other issues like immigration abortion to kind of flesh out or understanding of this\nTV campaigns reach a lot a lot a lot of people and a door to door canvassing is limited to the number of volunteers you have to fan out in the community\nWhich is why the campaign industrial complexes built around television advertising\nSo let's just say the effects that you found in your studies hold true through subsequent studies and become the received wisdom of political campaigning there's still the problem of of seeing enough individual voters at their door steps to really have any effect\nThere actually are plenty of political campaigns that Bernie Sanders' campaign in twenty sixteen the ... campaign right now in Texas and many others who have succeeded in recruiting just a huge number of volunteers to go talk to their neighbors and knock on doors so from my perspective if campaigns don't try and really\nThink about the art and science of recruiting volunteers and building a team to talk to their neighbors then it's no surprise that if they don't make a good try at it they're not going to have much success and in terms of the dollars and cents of it I think it's also a vision of American democracy that normative leap we might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign\nGoing to have much success and in terms of the dollars and cents of it I think it's also a vision of American democracy the normative leap we might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign budget or to do lots of fundraisers with rich donors to be able to bankroll a serious field team what you need is a candidate or a cause\nThat many kinds of engaged individuals want to go volunteer their time to spread the word about\nIn two weeks' time will know how Massachusetts voted on question three will that tell us anything definitive about inoculation\nIs there some way that we could find ourselves on founder statistical floating on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science to materialize\nI wouldn't really resist the temptation to generalize too much from any particular election result that's kind of a trap that that research on campaigns and elections and campaign consultant has been for a hundred years what we really would like to know is what would have happened in the campaign\nIf they had done something else which of course we can't know because the campaign only happened a particular way so that's why we need these kinds of rigorous clinical trials to randomly assigned voters or districts or whatever else to say we can actually see what happens when we do this and when we don't\nYeah but just between you and me should I be like investing heavily in clipboard futures [laughter]\nWell I think what we tend to see in other industries is that as new ideas and innovations come out of academia they diffused over time and relatively slowly into the real world so I don't know that I think that campaigns will or even necessarily should\nBe taking this one study we have and never reorientate all their activities around it within the next year I Hope on the scale of ten or Twenty years we'll have built up the kind of evidence based that is very persuasive and rigorous and the prejudice reduction advocates will be interested in applying in their work", "show_name": "On the Media", "year": "2018", "city":
