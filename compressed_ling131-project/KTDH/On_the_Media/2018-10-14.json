Mesopotamia\nBill ... is a cultural anthropologist and socio legal scholar at the University of California Irvine\nAll of a sudden we have this kind of new thing people a lot of people living in a place altogether meeting some kind of system of coordination so that they can all continue to live together in a sort of settled community with a population size it's getting to the point where I Can't keep track of who everyone is anymore\nAnd we start to see centralized systems\nTo help people keep track of what they owe to whom wait what\nHe's describing ledgers system of recording obligations and their payment that's not what they taught us in school we all learned that money was simply an advancement on the earlier barter system chicken for grain for X. blades and so on everybody knows that\nIn primitive day's living with simple and each family produced whatever is needed the\nFirst kind of business was bothered a good stone cutter for instance might\nMake a few extra tools and simply trade them for ... and other things he was it was easy there was no need for money\nMore from that delicious Nineteen forty seven educational film we heard earlier\nLife today is too complex people are too dependent upon each other jobs are too highly specialized what else to do business by butter and that's why we depend on money as a quick and easy medium of exchange\nOnly problem is says now we're no matter what we learned in school the anthropological record offers no evidence up simple barter anywhere in history\nYeah so the barter story is a an origin story for money that you know has a a very long history Aristotle\nIn history yeah so the barter story is a an origin story for money that you know has a a very long history Aristotle actually\nUse that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be and in the nineteenth century as economics was becoming professionalized economists picked up this barter origin story\nFor money and kind of set it forth into the world um the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs you might think a ha there it is\nThis is for instance you attack a pleaded string decorated with calories and other precious objects which was used by the Danny people in New guinea to determine and to pay for the exact price of a pig\nThat's barter but but what you're really seeing is part of a much more complex series of relationships that people are engaged in that generally you have to do with some pretty serious social concerns concerns over\nBirth over marriage over death over the continuation of a lineage or a tribe where the pig in this case isn't just any old pig being exchanged and I always think of you know Charlotte's Web in this context some\n\nSome pig it's some tickets a special pig that indicates a relationship between families it's not just a commodity that value can be set by the price mechanism the way that the barter story assumes\nSo how did this border mythology or become so nearly universal why is this news to me\nVery often origin stories are serving contemporary interests so if we want to believe that the market as it exists today\nAnd money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable then something like the barter origin story helps us justify it continued existence helps disabled look you know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of wants which is what economists call that problem when\nYou know I've got fish and you've got apples and you don't want my fish and I don't want your Apple's so it's great to justify current conditions\nBut when you start kind of cracking it open and start sort of peeling back the layers and realizing that that's not really how it happened in that how it happened was you know actually a lot more interesting in a lot more complicated and involved things like\nRecord keeping accounting systems of measure uh states and early state control and shaping of markets and so forth well then you're in a whole other\nRealm the real story is told in Mesopotamia tablets and other artifacts record keeping dating from the rise of agriculture and settled communities in the ancient Near East phenomena that demanded the invention of book keeping\nWe're dealing now with people who aren't just hunting and gathering butter growing grain and are taking care of animals like sheep and goats these commodities have seasonal cycles I plant the grain\nAnd it takes a while to turn into stuff that I can read and turned into you know do and bread and sheep and goats only Cav during certain parts of the year you know if I'm planting grain and I'm going to give some to you after a period of time and you're raising goats and you're going to give some to me after a period of time\nWe both have the built in ... analogy of those plants and animals to deal with and what we start to see in those situations is the emergence of central authorities\nCentral clearing houses which had some properties of temples observe spiritual authority and some of thanks\nSo this is going to kind of over simplify it but we basically right little contracts to each other\nObserve spiritual authority and some of thanks\nSo this is going to kind of over simplify it but we basically right little contracts to each other that say things like okay look you're giving me this go today thank you after a certain period of time after six months I Will\nRepay that debt that I now with certain number of bushels of [noise] okay that is it from the fertile crescent three millennia ago it's from a different town the Chicago Board\nOf trade soybean trading floor from two thousand and six but you get the idea and in both cases every promise was recorded\nWe have scribes in these temples keep track of these contracts and that's where we start to see something like money\nIt's kind of a time deferred contract for the settlement of a debt recorded on that clay I like to joke that you know in the beginning was not the coin in the beginning was the receipt and that's essentially what you've got in those clay tablets\nAnd others slightly less portable media\nTravel as the New York times retro reported to the tiny my British an island of yeah home to the money the size of semi truck we'll made of stone\n[noise] there are thousands of these towns all over the place [noise]\nThey're actually an ancient form of currency who's value resides partly in scarcity stones had to be imported in canoes from neighboring islands partly in the effort invested to quarry and knew them\nBut mainly in the communal memory of who owns them and the consensus of their worth and my teacher named hung the ruler from her Ted Talk\nNow they don't actually movies rice turns around her exchange them rice things can get to be pretty massive the largest is about four times and twelve feet across\nYou can't feed the meter with them or melt them down or wire them abroad you can only remember with them\nSo they just kinda keep track of who owns what part of what stone\nConley hold that thought to now in time the recording of obligations did give way to the shorthand of coin and currency and further to banking transactions and credit instruments and so on to the cost as we shall soon discuss of digital currency\nDusted money emerge not from the barter system but from the need to keep track of an unwieldy number of transactions suddenly it seems so hobbyists\n[noise] money is demonic defines a proxy for history a memory sticks\nOr not remember this is an endless perplexed we're talking about and if money is merely a record of obligations why does its value fluctuate sometimes even jai rate based on factors that have zero to do with who knows what to whom\nAnd you said how many times have you fiction I
