I'm an ... program director of your host today\nAnd we're recording live\nAt the victim's family Center for this arch we're on the beautiful camps to Pittsburgh State University in Pittsburgh Kansas and extreme southeast Kansas but it was listening to doing now where we are so without further ado I Want to welcome president Thomas Jefferson [noise]\n\nMr Jefferson's\nA good day to all of you citizens I must say I am so pleased to be invited to this deep into the American west um\nI'm regarded as the foremost architect of our westward expansion but\nI never travel farther than Seventy five miles west of my birthplace and Virginia and I'm so I bought Kansas\nUm [noise] uh but I never saw it and so and so that's a real pleasure to be able to be here and to read all through my I have one concern as I Begin um you know I I\nI thought a lot about the American west I wrote extensively about it and I actually believed that any creature once created\nProbably still exist as I did not understand evolution and I did not believe in extinction and so I actually urged Murray whether Lewis and the other of my explorer friends to look for the woolly mammoths and the American west\nOr the ... or the ... and hope that they would find evidence that those creatures still grazed somewhere\nI'm I'm a Great Plains\nThey unfortunately did not bring back any evidence of a mammoth or the mouse with bomb but ... you can imagine my surprise when I arrived here and learn that you still have gorillas here\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\nMy young friend Mary rather Lewis does not describe a\nAnd we're very proud of our gorillas here at Pittsburgh State University\nMr Jefferson our our topic tonight that we'll be talking quite a bit about is the Louisiana Purchase so yes you persist Kansas along with uh our our ... our listeners here is in Kansas Missouri Arkansas and Oklahoma so we're we're smack dab in Boise in a territory which I think most people will remember back in high school\nIs was from New Orleans dredging up to the Canadian border and double the size of the United states it was bought from France from\nIs was from New Orleans dredging up to the Canadian border and double the size of the United states\nIt was bought from France from Napoleon 'em for Fifteen million dollars in one of your huge accomplishments during your presidency and that's probably about all they remember about but there is an amazing chain of events that caused all this to benefit the United states\nSo in in in your wars Mr Jefferson or can you tell us a little bit about this major purchase of Kansas and the surrounding area\nWell first let me say that I don't take particular credit\nServing the navy for it or something maybe nine I was a minister plan of potential route to the courts of of Europe and I joined Dr Frank I'm I'm John Adams there\nBefore Napoleon's time so he never got to me I saw the beginning I was one of the most fortunate enough men I participated in a small way on our own\nRevolution and then I had the chance in Seventy and eighty seven to see a much greater revolution in Paris mean ours was a benign revolution compared to the French Revolution and and as you know the French Revolution when they're very\nTime revolution compared to the French Revolution and and as you know the French Revolution when in a very destructive\nDirection eventually and and descended into a reign of terror and which ten or Fifteen thousand were beheaded than there were terrible street riots and a whole series of wars were born of this that didn't really end until Eighteen Fifteen um\nBut when I was I left before all this really became chaotic and I was thrilled because I thought that the little flame that we live on the fourth of July Seventeen Seventy six which really was the beginning of a whole\nNew era in human history when the rights of man we're going to be understood for the first time I thought that little flame had jumped across the Atlantic and now\nIt was going to win golf all of the tyranny of the old world and our revolution was going to be the spark that liberated the entire earth and so\nI was thrilled at first and then I saw towards the end of my time in France that it was\nTurning into a very dark direction and here's here's the answer to that\nWe were right we were ready for liberty because we were highly educated we were European derived from northern Europe from England with England had a long tradition of the magna car to the bill of rights and the the glorious rebellion and so on and so\nWe were the inherit tours of a of a of a people that had already established liberty the French had never known liberty they'd only known despotism of the people were\nWere terribly ignorant and if you expect to be an Asian ignorant and free you expect to have never has been the never can be in the history of the world and so I felt that they weren't ready for our\nLevel of freedom that that what they really need to do is go to an intermediary phase and then wait a generation or two and then move to a greater liberty in and eventually they would get to us but I haven't I have the stage there you can't impose\nDemocracy on other people they have to be able to create it out of their own value system\nAnd the ... and it looked like he was more in the ah\nThe market for conquer conquering the world [noise]\nAnd he was he was of the ... of the age you know exactly what I predicted what happened happened unfortunately but the revolution collapsed and the military dictator emerged out of it and he was a psychotic\nUm who wanted to control the world and he waged war against everybody and it took from Seventeen Ninety nine to Eighteen Fifteen to finally stop it and that would be one thing if it were just\nThe old world but it bled over into our world the French Revolution bled over into American caused enormous political chaos here\nAnd and that's kind of where we get into the meat of actually the purchase that happened um 'cause they they hadn't they'd just acquired again the Louisiana Territory from Spain\nThey well they they Napoleon took it from Spain he just insisted that they see the\nFact that there was a there was a kind of a one sided trade was there not\nIt was called the treaty is on the phone so and he gave them the Spanish almost nothing and took because he wanted to build a new empire he\nHit one of his plans was to start a New Orleans and then to to fill the Louisiana Territory with the French and if he had succeeded Kansas would be a French speaking colony or French Republic we\nAh [noise]\nAnd what may be hit saved that was what happened in Haiti or what is now known as Haiti of the French had a colony there\nHowever and what may be hit save that was what happened in Haiti or what is now known as Haiti\nOr the French had a colony there it was a very profitable sugar plantations but there was an uprising in their slaves slaves up rose um really basically slaughtered enemies horribly horribly horribly bloody of his laughter and you know they're they're a slave owners\nSo Napoleon sends a one of the most\nPowerful our monitors in the world and he was in the world to to Haiti he wants to have get basically gives them that were taken over when you're done go ahead and head towards New Orleans and see what you can you there\nThe first thing he had to do is quell this rebellion and there was a the the conditions of slavery and the Caribbean were infinitely worst than here it's bad institution anywhere but\nThe conditions were appalling and they were ... working slaves to death and beating them to death and\nThere were disappearances and concentration camps and there was an unspeakable mess and finally if you push any people too hard too long they will finally rise up and so there was a black leader by the name of to solve all of a chore\nAnd he led the black Haitians against the colonial masters and the poll and decided to\nQuell this rebellion and he sent his best troops\nUm with his brother in law to to do this but when they had to Haiti sent them into it was called then um the diseases they're yellow fever and malaria and so on were so I'm\nHorrible that they they killed off his troops that he lost the bulk of his best troops to disease and guerrilla warfare and so when this happened it was a debacle that was expensive it was it was time consuming it it it it decimated has armed forces\nIt a disillusion everyone who was in the field and so in a poll and finally said\nI'm done with the U.S just sell\nThe territory to the Americans if we can and get something out of it\nAnd we'll revisit this after I conquer Great Britain and Russia\nAnd this led to [laughter] and this led them to be a so enthusiastic about giving such a great deal to the Americans to get that Fifteen million dollars\nHe knew that if you know the war so when I became president and the policy on of course had already begun but there was the piece of mommy ends and Eighteen to and so there was a brief interlude where there was peace with lots of tell Eighteen five and this was a great boon to us because\nWe were just a simple Republican we didn't want to be caught in this world we just wanted to fail trees and create farms and to build a merchant marine and an end to end to gain some prosperity\nAnd to be drawn into that World War would have been just ruin us for us and so fortunately there was a three year peace\nWell when you realize he was not going to be able to get to quell this rebellion and Haiti\nHe decided that he would turn back to his wars in Europe and he needed cash\nHe was going to break the treaty of on the ends and so he thought the Fifteen million he got from us was a lot of money\nAnd he knew that once the war started again the British navy the biggest in the world would simply take New Orleans so he was going to lose it to the breaths why not sell it to the banks\nBecause then the Brits might still take it but he got Fifteen million so all of this was going on and that's why I say I don't take any credit for this because I was just I wanted one little thing to keep the Mississippi River open I did not want any part of of European affairs you know in\nMy opinion we are so fortunate\nTo have a three thousand miles moat\nYou know in my opinion we are so fortunate to have a three\nThousand miles mote between how some of the old world\nThe old world is a world of madness and superstition in class hierarchy and religious wars and chaos\nAnd nonsense\nAnd we this innocent agrarian people living three thousand miles away from them can can rest we weren't going to have the incessant wars that have rocked Europe for centuries and here and I take some little credit for this\nWe separated church and state so that we didn't have the religious wars that have rocked the world for millennia and so the glory is that you live here in\nPittsburgh Kansas you can worship one\nGod or none or three or Islam or\nYour whole or\nIn a Christian sect to please you can be a Unitarian or an atheist stores are all Astoria in Oregon do and here you have no civil reward and no civil penalty penalty you're utterly free to worship the God of your choice\nRead some history\nYou're the only nation that's ever had this freedom and it means that we can live in peace and when you walk in the streets of of Pittsburgh and you see a Catholic or a Methodist you don't have to fight a dual [laughter] you could just tip your hat to them and they go off to their church and you go off to your chapel\nAnd every one lives in harmony because we've decided in America that that's private what you what you believe about\nGod and religion is your own and the state the government has absolutely no right to get in the way between you and and the God of your choice that's the glory of the American system I think\n\nBlack or white or read male or female Jew or gentile or or Unitarian what we share as Americans as we're citizens so we are citizens and if we call each other citizen\nThat expresses are equality I didn't like the terms ... Mr and Mrs a master and ask choir and Dr\nBecause they create these social distinctions which I think of damage to the European world almost beyond recognition and so I wanted us to find as many ways to be equal in America as we possibly could be and and every time I had a chance to join a secret organization I reluctantly said no\nJust because I did not want to help to create\nClass distinctions we're so fortunate\nYou know in my time I don't know that this is true and yours we had the widest middle class world that ever known a tiny number of rich and an even tiny or number pour the great mass of people were the middling condition and there was this brought equality here and where there is a quality there will be human happiness\nJohn Adams on how close with us and then we're gonna have another little segment of this of this program so ... so please don't rush out unless you have to I'm\nAdam ... and I had been friends than we core old over the French Revolution than a whole range of things than I supplied to them as the president he was a one term president and he thought he should serve at least two and was upset when he was retired and blamed me in part\nOn and he committed the greatest not been the history of transitions he left Washington city at four AM\nOn the day of my inauguration and the public stage because he refused to stay to see me inaugurated in this place that was personally unkind\nBut it also was a violation of our system because in a republic when we transfer of power from one administrator for the next thing needs to be a sign of harmony in continuity and not just taste\nSo I never saw him again you know I didn't travel I I went back to my cello after my presidency and I never left its environments for the last Seventeen years of my life\nAnd Adams was up in brain tree Massachusetts and so we would have died on reconciled but our mutual friend of ours by the name of Dr Benjamin Rush decided that he wanted to reconcile us called us the north pole and the south pole of the American revolution\nAnd so he made a real campaign of this over several years and they finally convinced us to start writing to each other by telling each one of us\nThat the other was ready for reconciliation\nAnd so Adams broke the silence first on the first day of January Eighteen twelve with a ... little letter and I wrote back a careful little reply and then he wrote a slightly more effusive letter and I did too and then suddenly the flu skates of arranged the facts\nI wrote back a careful little reply and then he wrote a slightly more effusive letter and I did too and then\nSuddenly the flu skates of our ancient affection opened and we became um deer correspondence and close friends one of the things that we wrote about was aristocracy\nAn Adam said what think U. of aristocracy and I said I'm for\nNatural aristocracy but I'm against pseudo aristocracy natural aristocracy is talent creativity wisdom intelligence good judgment artistic capacity these people are born\nWe don't all have it and when you find a natural aristocrat and by the way Alexander Hamilton was one when you find a natural or ... you want to nurture\nThat person and lift that person into leadership positions in the arts and in politics and so on\nNot everyone can teach a college course we want our natural aristocrats will be those professors not everyone can paint we want our natural aristocrats to paint\nThe problem in culture has been that we've given authority to the pseudo aristocrats and these are people who are just born into privilege they don't have any particular merit often they haven't done\nAnd so the good nation is the one that takes\nAuthority away from the pseudo areas the crowds and puts it instead on the natural aristocrats of course that's what a university like this one does is is to try to nurture young natural aristocrats you call it a meritocracy I'm for that ...\nWere born equal we have equal rights under the law but we're not equal and beauty and\nStrength in character in artistic capacities or even intelligence and we need to lean on them best of ourselves the best minds\nThe best judgments we want our our leaders are senators are governors our presidents to be the very best exemplars of what it is to be an American\nAnd when we settled for anything less\nThan we make this difficult because the republic is a very fragile form of government\nA republic only works if all of you in this room try to be your best self all of the time\nThinking of a hard that is but you have to try to be your best self and to be civil and polite and tolerant and generous\nEven when you don't feel like it but if we all do that if we're all striving to be our best selves\nTo read to work from evidence to argue only those things we actually know something about\nUm to give people the benefit of the doubt to to listen with respect to tolerate things that appear to be intolerable if we will rise to our best selves then if we all list this culture together we might be a a thriving republic and there's one more peaceful I Want to close with and that's agriculture\nWhat I Love about Kansas\nBecause you have been a farm state\nHow many of you are actual farmers that's not good\nThey're like three farmers here [noise]\nI wouldn't have come out I Know and I was\nTold Kansas has this agrarian place wheat and farming and soybeans and it turns out you're you're not farmers up I said in my only book notes on Virginia those who labor and the earth the chosen people of God\nFarmers up I said in my only book notes on Virginia those who labor on the earth of the chosen people of God in February he had chosen people whose breath she has made his peculiar deposit for genuine the stench of virtue\nI Believe that a nation based on family farming is more likely to be virtuous I'm happy an independent than any other form of nation whatsoever so how many of you have some genealogical linked to a farm [noise]\nWhile they're usually\nThey're living on fumes [noise]\nI just started I just urge the following\nTwo things 'cause we're I'm a university campus number one I Want you all to grow up\nSomething in the next year or a tomato geranium asparagus a potato\nTomatoes are particularly important to me so I Want you to grow something even a little pop\nBecause if you grow as you know if you grow something it deepens your connection to nature and natural law so how many of you will grow something and then next year or ... or we should we should follow this up\nAnd secondly I Want you all to consider learning ancient Greek\n[noise] it is worth burning ancient Greek three at home or in the original\n... and you might think I'm joking but I'm not it is worth learning ancient Greek to read Homer in the original and then you can read about happens in the fourth century and you will you will if you imagine if a year from now I came back and there were thirty Greek\nOh scholars here you would be internationally famous\nAs so places suddenly had a Greek Revival [noise]\nI'm Serious grow something and at least learn a foreign language and if possible let it be ancient Greek and may I say to all of you may your revolutions be as peaceful as possible and as bloody as required so thank you thank you very much [noise]\n\n\nJust want to [noise] I Know the evening\nGrows legs were good but I Want to just do a couple of things where if I Want to put on this [laughter]\nThe scrutiny non drivers army I'm have\nA ... for doing those things for you for being the host I'm so delighted this will lead at this and that will create of Thomas Jefferson our um knew what you can get by the way I\nGuess but it's your broadcast on Saturdays is about a Saturday the three uncaring PS eighty nine point nine or ...\n[noise] [noise] oh just\nFirst of all I'm thrilled to be here I've been here before I don't know how many of you remember the great plains Chautauqua\nIt's I I was one of the creators of the great plains to talk with started in Bismarck North Dakota we came down here in the Nineteen eighties", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Thomas Jefferson Hour", "city":
