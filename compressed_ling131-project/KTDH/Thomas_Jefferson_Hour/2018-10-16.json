award winning founding brothers this time about his latest book published in October of ... the teen American by along the founding fathers in less than we have a bunch of questions they ask us about let's let's return to the conversation so here's the great jokes about\nOne thing it was a sad and pathetic spectacle and then you go on to say that Jefferson wanted so much for us to be a republic\nA unique experimental government in which the people were actually solve room and to the extent unprecedented in human history govern themselves and that the greatest architect of vision and the second half of his life and particularly in the last two decades actually gave his mighty energies\nTo the self destruction of that very concept because he was so paralyzed by his racism in by his complicity in slavery that is such a powerful argument\nJefferson envision the civil war in his mind as a possibility but\nHe believed that it was the north that was causing that potentially occur by assisting on slavery as an as an institution that had to be removed and um and Jefferson said it\nOn slavery as an as an institution that had to be removed and um and Jefferson said\nThis is a threat to the chapter I guess that I too expected slavery ... and and I believe it is incompatible with the values of the American revolution\nHowever it has to happen a certain way\nIf for it to work and one of the ways that has happened is each state needs to decide this on its own but secondly we need to have a plan to remove all the freed slaves from the continent of North America or from the United states um\nBefore we implement any kind of emancipation planned\nYou've been at this for a long time and when I first met you or we were up the American Korean society than we were income burn shop in New Hampshire and at that time you were\nI think it's I Hope I'm not miss characterizing you you were less severe about Jefferson than you have since become so can you tell us a little bit about the trajectory of your historical thinking on this subject\nSevere is probably not a wrong word I don't like it but I I I understand why you use it\nThat I'm at the time I wrote a\nAmericans fangs when you and I got to know each other and weed coke consulted with Ken Burns on his documentary I two things have changed one is that I've become more aware that I was the end\nOf the\nExistence and pervasive influence of race in America I thought we were on a path after the civil rights movement that would gradually and inevitably carriers to some form of bi racial justice\nIronically that\nThe civil rights movement and the legislation of the early sixties civil rights as acts of sixty four and six ... merely said we're going to actually implement the decisions we made after the civil war and the fourteenth fifteenth amendment\nAnd we just waited a hundred years to do it um but that in that sense I thought that Martin Luther king was right when he said that the arc of a moral universe or moves towards justice\nAnd I still think that's true and some long term sense but I think that the real pattern in America is backlash and we're at a ... black lash moment\nYou start this book Joe are you in your introduction it's almost as if you're a I don't want to say making an excuse or apologizing but ... you're using history then and now which is kind of different view yes in the introduction ends with given the current condition is a deeply divided people my hope is that the founding\nEra can become a safe place to gather together not so much to find the answers to those questions as to argue them indeed if I read the founders right their greatest legacy is the recognition that\nArgument itself is the answer it sets the book up quite well sir\nWell that's what I really believe and um I think the first ... the ... practice or whatever we call it in the book I'm Talking to the reader and saying that I'm going to do something here that I haven't done before and that professional historians aren't supposed to say that they're doing\nProfessional story that I Am a professional historians car yeah you are [laughter] um that were trained to to say and believe that the past as a foreign country and we're like anthropologist moving through time you don't want to go to ...\nSay and believe that the past as a foreign country and we're like anthropologist moving through time you don't want to go to some mow and say how come you guys aren't practicing the child rearing or procedures of doctor Spock\nOkay [noise] um and similarly historians are not supposed to bring their convictions in values and the president to bear on the past we want to go back and recovery in its own terms\nWere not capable of objectivity because we're not mathematicians or physicists but were perhaps capable and detachment and at least that's the goal we have to get as close to as possible\nAnd therefore we should resist writing from the president to stick in the word present to stick his bad term in American history and history you know like your present to stick means you're just imposing so I going to go back and look at ... percent and find out whether or not he's an evangelical Christian let's say\nAnd um and you cherry pick the evidence to find that [noise] but my view is that in that even detachment is a delusion\nNamely that we are only capable of looking\nBack at than from now and it is inevitable that we either consciously or unconsciously\nBring our own values and convictions and troubles to that particular endeavor so that Charles beard looks back from the high point of the progressive movement in Nineteen Thirteen at the founders and what does he discover Pluto talk or see on the robber barons\nArthur Schlesinger looks back at Nineteen Nineteen thirty seven at Jackson and the Jacksonian America and why does he discover\nFDR and the new deal\nNow those are two great books by the way but it's their emblematic of the way in which it is virtually impossible for any historian to be completely detached and instead of saying okay that ... I'm saying\nLet's make a virtue of that and self consciously identify the problems of our president and use that as a prism through which to look at the past and be honest about an open about it\nHonest you are sure I mean I I look at the book and I go back to the ... this this positive constructive statements that a recognition that argument itself is the answer and you using a this historical period you know best not a book\nYou we have chapters on a Jefferson Adams Madison and Washington\nAnd you put some pretty difficult truth about all of them and then you sort of analyze it at the end of each chapter by going to now I was left feeling very positive I thought it was very constructive\nVegetarian Jeffersonian of you I'm Glad you did that I think that that there are other books that have come out recently there's one by John reach him the other another from I'm\nDoris Kearns Goodwin that are attempting to look back to pass from our world here in Donald Trump's America and [noise] what ... both of them do is is uh\nThey do quite well and I recommend books um they find an optimistic story to tell their ... in a sense they say that we face great crises before move through men and and we've always gotten through and and the and the the phrase that ... calls on this the better angels of our nature\nUm and I know John and I said he's not a sentimental is that I Would say to him if he were product you know that John remember he gave that speech in first inaugural march Eighteenth sixty one and the next day South Carolina seceded from union and we had the bloody civil war ... American history hardly the better angels of our nature prevent\nAnd the next day South Carolina seceded from union and we had the bloody civil war the last word American history hardly the better angels of our nature prevailed and that so that in some sense my take\nIn the end is to say I'm not here to say that if you just hang around long enough to liberal conditions come save is what I'm saying you got to know what we're really up against\nCould the incident mean for us Saudi relations and the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\nTuesday Morning beginning at five central\n\nH.

Adams is saying now that it's all going to and then when it does I mean what are they become more\nUrban and uh one of the population increases um we're going to ... that the freedom and equality or not compatible and then our terms in terms of our president I mean that\nIf you believe the market should be given to complete freedom to function as you can quote pursue your happiness there without restraint\nThe net result will be oligarchy include taco see\n'cause that's what always happens in Europe and that's what's gonna happen here and he turns out to be right in the first gilded age which starts in the late Nineteen century and ends officially Nineteen twenty eight um\nAnd and we're now in a second gilded age which started in Nineteen eighty and and we now have in Nineteen excuse me in two thousand H. A. we surpassed the high point of inequality that we had reached before and the first gilded age\nIn Nineteen twenty eight and this is it's incredible I mean ... somebody needs to talk about this more with it the nation that invented the middle class society\nNo long and now is has the highest level of economic inequality of any advanced society in the world\nWe are no longer a middle class society\nUm now because everybody in America is somehow part of the middle class because we're such and such a vague term but that the what was the diamond has become a triangle\nAnd the top ten percent and much further up you go especially the one percent and then beyond that to the point one percent I mean the top ten hedge fund makers make five times as much money than all the kindergarten teachers in the United states\nUm and that Adams is saying ... Adams does not have an answer to that problem what Adams is saying is that there isn't negotiation that has to occur between what we would now call capitalism and now called democracy\nIn in this book tour you're gonna do you're gonna be on lots of media now a ... one of the questions you really want to be asked about this book what what do you want to be liberated in your own discourse within the next three months\nI'm not just being complimentary that nobody will be as good a question or as you've just spent\nBut surely you have this idea about asking me about this American because I'm ready to say this round of the country\nYou'd asked me the ... the racial questions are very important and I expect to be asked them and I hope I am the income inequality too\nI'm In the current debate over the Supreme Court I expect some questions about constitutional a theory and the originalist position which is Kavanaugh's position\nAnd I'm prepared to talk about that in ways that are being provocative because I think the origin list are preposterous Lee wrong you Tom\nAnd um and in foreign policy which we haven't talked much about um uh it's the key figure is Washington and look at the ... not the question I wanted to ask me is what is what did American accent\nLet's see which we haven't talked much about um\nUh it's the key figure is Washington and look at the ... not the question I wanted to ask me is what is what did American exceptionalism means and and what does it mean now it's exactly the opposite\nNow by American exceptionalism remain the world is ready for us to sort of decide it the rule and in America has a privileged position and an obligation to expand its liberal values throughout the world\nThe founders thought that they didn't use they said we're are unique but precisely because we were unique Washington didn't think that the model of society we had was going to be transported to the rest of the world\nIt didn't take it was going to work in France for example and the French Revolution but the notion that we are going to sound is set up a Jeffersonian democracy in the middle of Iraq\nThat is out of the question that's never going to work and that's the view of exceptionalism they had\nAnd so let me ask you this kind of a last question about this goes to Madison\n... because I'm you know in some ways Madison was the greatest of the founders he's the least are entertaining maybe of the founders but\nA profound thinker he was Jefferson's Aristotle keeping represent grounded in some sense in the real world I agree with that so you're projecting forward from James Madison and these other founders taking a look at us now\nWith our paralyzed Congress or politicized courts are tribalism so the idea of Newtonian checks and balances and the kind of wonderful machine that would go of itself the amount of some help to craft vacuum some if you looked around this thing to say\nHey what what he's saying be what's the remedy\nBut of course he's dead and he's busy being dead so he can't come out and talk to us but if you read him and try to figure out\nI mean he in Eighteen twenty nine he said I expect this document that I helped to create to last for at most a hundred years I think that he would say you know that we have to rethink this basic structure of the constitution", "show_name": "Thomas Jefferson Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "16"}
