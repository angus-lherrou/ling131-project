P. P. R. dot org and again thank you\nCome back to the Thomas Jefferson city on the conversation with Thomas Jefferson this week we're speaking with President Jefferson about him as a leader\nReally right now talking about your intellectual development we talked about some of your teachers are going back to when you were nine years old and then up to the only time that William and Mary Lou Williams small you've run off your next great mentor Mr\nGeorge George with was a self taught Greek scholar and he was the greatest legal mind in Virginia he may have been the greatest legal mind\nIn America at the time I was so fortunate to read law with him for a number of years we had no law schools in my time one red for the law by working with the seasons practitioner like George with although he was better than everybody else and he\nTook me seriously as a young intellectual and it is his his message was was very straightforward he said Mr Jefferson\nYou cannot be a complete lawyer unless you are a complete human\nBeing so you must read and read deeply in the history of liberty and the history of constitutions in the history of of the human aspiration for for freedom and happiness you should read\nMany hours per day as you possibly can and who did you read ... at his direction a ... a month askew\nAnd as many hours per day as you possibly can and who did you read ... at his direction a ... a month to skew and Dole Bach and or so and volts hair and Dr Johnson and David Hume and\nA Adam Ferguson and blurred cams and it goes on and on and on he said you know you will learn the law you'll be practicing the law so that will come with practice with the actual engagement with clients and in court spot but now's the time for you to become a complete human beings so that you bring a full\nMaturity to everything that follows in your life I don't think any gift could have been a greater one than that and so I read ... harder maybe during my time with George with then I had even a as a student at the at the college\nAnd with was it's hard to say how great a Greek scholar he was you know most people in my world could puzzle through some French and some life and I won't say they mastered those languages but they knew enough\nThat they could puzzle through them Greek is a whole different\nThing you have to really wants to know Greek it's a discipline\nProbably nobody in America in North or South America knew classical Greek as well as George with did\nAnd he agreed to help me master that language which I did that\nIs four or five or six years of of working every single day with extraordinary devotion memorizing a learning the congregations\nThat the clinicians the different voices and moods of the Greek language it's a different alphabet so you have to overcome that first but uh it's it's not laughed and laughed and helped to create\nModern languages including English which has an enormous number of Latin loan words Rica's is another world entirely but it's worth it let me tell you it's worth\nMastering ancient Greek if only to read Homer in the original Greek but that's just the beginning of it and and this could never have happened to me if I had gone to a law school of your sort\nOr if I had um red law apprentice for the law with a a a typical Virginia attorney of some sort\nYou are credited with a several times in your life providing lists of suggested reading for particularly for young gentleman\nYes this was from the ... gave me great pleasure and then people would write to me as I\nWould you I'm a man of moderate fortunes I have a following budget to spend on books would you would you be willing to recommend the course of reading and and and and the additions and translations and so on the books and I would drop everything to do this this was one of the happiest things\nThat I ever got to do and if you read those lists they're very daunting because they essentially so I read everything\nUp and hear the additions in ... you should purchase a four passes and Cicero into cities in Bolivia and Caesar and solace and and so Tony us and and so on but\nI enjoyed this very much I always broke the budget of of the person who who who who asked these things but but you know I I guess I Want them to just to pause here to to say something that I think people in your time need to know which is that thanks to Gutenberg\nThe best thoughts of humankind can be routinely and relatively inexpensively disseminated\nIf you go to Britain college Oxford the oldest library in the city of\nInexpensively disseminated if you go to Britain college Oxford the oldest library in the city of\nOxford the the giants four wheels are literally chained to the wall because books were so rare so expensive that they ... they could not allow students to smuggle them out so they changed them to the wall along\nComes Gutenberg\nAnd tedious manuscript copying by hand is replaced by movable type by the time I was a young Virginian we hadn't cheapen the costs of printing enormously and in really was the first time that something like a mass market\nUm could be said to exist and so we have access to books\nI mean most people before the reformation had never held a Bible in their hands had never read the Bible in a vernacular had never read the Bible in Latin\nThis came through priests most people and tell the seventeenth century\nCould never afford a book or get one if they could afford it and if they got one that would be some tedious biblical commentary or or or something of a very little actual human utility the book is the most revolutionary tool that the world has ever\nSeen you can sit in a coffee house and there can be ten people there and each one reading a different book each one therefore\nWith a different argument with a different vocabulary with a different style a different author a different point of view a different sensibility up by reading books we can expand\nThe size of our mind I'm ex financially and we can expand our horizons and see things that could never be understood if\nYou just live your life for a moment to moment and the president and so I think in your time people have begun to think less of books for some reason I Would urge you all to reconsider that because of the book\nI said the book is the most revolutionary tool of all because now that it's cheaply produced it can be smuggled into despotic regimes\nAnd once the bill of rights or the universal declaration of rights and France or the constitution of the United states or John Locke or Isaac Newton once these volumes maybe indoor decimal maybe in October\nCertainly in court shows these are small enough to be placed quietly in one's luggage and they get into some\nTyrannical culture and when people have a chance to read the truth the truth as exhibited in lock second treatise on government or bowling Brooks\nAnd criticism of of received Christianity\nThey will never asked once people have access to the truth they will never rest and those cultures are going to be reformed and liberalized\nI Do have a list in front of me I'm not sure it's completely accurate but some of these lists has survived\nAnd I noticed that they they are neatly categorized in ancient history philosophy literature or a politics religion science um and there are a number of titles that to die recognize there are many\nThat I Do not recognize that I did recognize that you have a on this list to books by Benjamin Franklin\nFranklin was our greatest scientist\nOne of the titles is on electricity the other is a historical review Pennsylvania\nRight both important of let me go to the one on electricity for example so\nYou take it for granted\nRight both important of let me go to the one on electricity for example so\nYou you take it for granted it it's in everything you\nDo that this was not the case in my time uh we lived our lives we might have had candles to lie to ourselves at night or he came from burning pit coal or um possibly would\nLearning to love the show your grandparents made you'll watch what I think foreign slut his foreign EMT but that's part of what spray\nOne and I do and\nThat the next time on studio three sixty Thursday morning at three central\nMichigan is an acting knife blade expand Camille send them an old photograph of herself and she's a little kid on vacation with your family in Canada\nAnd then I went back at the picture and I saw my grandma walking through behind her blading\nCamille grew up in different states committed no him at that age or his grandma Clinton in is do they mean anything this week on\nI grew up in different states committed no him at that age or his grandma Clinton in is do they mean anything this week a\nFriday morning at three central\nWelcome back to the Thomas Jefferson our weekly conversation with President Thomas Jefferson end your weekly conversation [noise] what's your creator of Thomas Jefferson on strictly Jake hands he can last for me now David I have to\nSay Jefferson was taken in by the the literary hoax of auction we now know that it was all fraud fits begin at the\nBeginning which was he is a young man how he began to become famous reader that he was\nHe was this brilliant young man hungry his father died when he was fourteen his father's last wish was the Jefferson be educated to the fullest extent of\nWhat the colony of Virginia could offer Jefferson took that very seriously worshipped his late father and he had a natural capacity for learning and he did it in a in a in a way that makes you almost\nShake your head to think of of how deep he was into it\nI couldn't help but wonder how much different he might have been had he not met William Small or George with\nI think that he would have still been extraordinary because he had really good training you know his father's last wish essentially\nAnd then the the Scots I'm angry and professors that he had these teachers that Mr Douglas and\nAnd the Reverend Mari were were excellent Jeffries was able to be a little critical of them because he's Jefferson but he he was getting a good education he almost certainly would have gone to William and Mary and even if William Small hadn't been there he probably would have had a a good education there but\nHe was a man who was who I think this is really important he was open to the idea of a mentor\nYou could say he was even looking for father's substitutes but he was open to the idea of a mentor and he was it it was impressionable you know when he would say he was a thing of wax and that these great men with them and William Small shaped him they stretch this wax into a young genius approve of\nThat is how much he put into becoming a mentor later in life\nHe took that role as you as you rightly pointed out on the program and he took that very very serious people that have\nRelished it was like you know an escape almost the way he talks about it the greatest funny could have\nWell he's a lucky and so he believes that man a human being is born with a blank slate ... we don't have any preconceived ideas there's nothing platonic rolling around in our heads we can be anything that you and it's like this idea give me this young mind and I'll\nTurn it into anything you want so Jefferson thought give me young minds and I will create ideal American agrarian\nIntellectual libertarian Republicans out of them and he just he just so thrived on being the\nTeacher the mentor to others you let people that he trusted like James Monroe actually go into his library into his private suite of rooms that by the cello and and have um freedom of his library which he was very I'm skeptical about doing with pure strangers\nWhat were you know we didn't talk about that but it said that he owns somewhere between nine and ten thousand books during his lifetime that's even given you a run for your money I\nThink well you know but his books mattered minor just throw like he also lost libraries his first one burned with the the shed wildfire in Seventeen Seventy in his second one the great library he sold the Congress and part of the deal was\nAt the center every book he couldn't you know to pick out eight hundred that he wanted to keep you had to sell all of it and so\nHe did keep ... well it but if you in referencing\nThis you know he sold is sixty five hundred volume library\nTo Congress and write a teen fourteen but when he died he he\nA few in referencing this you know he sold is sixty five hundred volume library to Congress and write a teen fourteen but when he died he the year before he died he drew up a catalog of all his books for the library of university lumped into that\nAnd at that point he had sixty eight hundred and sixty volumes so he had more than when he saw that with\nDavid thing of it this way if you said to me I have about twenty thousand bucks now if you said just take your iPhone and go down and take a picture of the spine of each one\nI wouldn't do it Jefferson\nWrote catalog after catalog after catalogue of his books that's all ... graphical material\nYeah they I I don't believe for one moment that will work for Jeff\nFor knowledge say he loved it but he must have been type a on steroids to think that's interesting because\nI mean just think of it he has ... let's just say he has his second library of about sixty four hundred volumes\nThat's each book is entitled to a long biblical graphical notation\nAndy's cataloguing them so he's saying this one belongs in history and that one's mathematics on that one is a religion so you had this big Coney ... apartheid system of classification reason memory and imagination and he he just loved doing this sort of work if you said to me I'll give you\nFive hundred thousand dollars if you catalogue your library by Christmas I'd say\nAnd what is my second prize you know what if I catalogue ten bucks by Chris from\nThe OK so before we go to this week's essay which is coming up and it's just a few minutes let's go back to the beginning in your ear almost I felt like you were on the verge of apologizing for this episode of uh the Scottish poet gee do you want to pick that up and\nYou know so there have been a lot of really interesting hoaxes hoaxes are really an extraordinary thing because some humans go way way way out of their way to convince others of something that's not true and here's McPherson James McPherson\nWho we now know invented option\nAnd he did it so well that a lot of the world was taken in by it and it took it took some very powerful skeptics like Dr Samuel Johnson one of my heroes\nTo see through this and to denounce McPherson but Jefferson\nWas just the exact sort of person who would be swept up in this because he loved the idea of a new discovery\nIt really didn't matter to him it whether it was authentic or not at some point it maybe he did but\nA great book on this subject by Andrew bursting about Jefferson sentimental ... and how um susceptible he was to Austin now he never as you said on the program an earlier part of the program he never got the materials he he wrote McPherson his brother and said\nI'll pay any price bearing the burden right in the blank check borrow money you name it I just want everything you you can put in my hands relating to ... [laughter] ... couldn't couldn't supply Jefferson with the apparatus that he wanted but imagine if he'd gotten that\nJefferson would have gone to what it's about a year doing everything we didn't talk about is how\n... popular all of this was you know today we live in a time when once when's the last book that that rocked the world I Can't think of one\nYou know there it doesn't happen anymore but there but at this time I book could rock 'cause the world\nAnd so it did and there was just enormous excitement about this the closest thing I can think of David is is when about Twenty years ago I'm I'm a German magazine published the loss diaries oh sure I'm sure that they turned out it was a fraud but the world was taken in ...\nI'm an of German magazine published the loss diaries oh sure I'm sure that they turned out it was a fraud but the world was taken in for a time and and there was this it was breathtaking everyone wanted access to this they were going to read this and this was going to be\nA show us the inner life of a vat of Hitler and and it was going to somehow explain everything that happened and then we find a ups\nIt's literary fraud and it it produce just gigantic embarrassment in historic graphical circles\nIt's always fun to bring up books with Mr Jefferson it's kind of like a sucker fine she you know you're going to have an interesting conversation with and we need to bring this conversation to a close um because it is time for this week's Jefferson watch but before we do I just want to you might want to\nYeah to things W. R. I.
