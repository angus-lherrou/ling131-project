troops under George Washington's command were wintering at a place called valley forge\nWhich was twenty three miles northwest of uh of Philadelphia\nPennsylvania and that's the basis of this story every every American school child has heard about in valley forge ...\nSoldiers with rags on their feet and blood and the snow but I'll tell you this David I had no idea until I read this book of how

why are we feel passionate about the book is we believe that the valley forge experience was the major turning point the revolutionary war\nIf some people argue Washington's Crossing some people argue Yorktown or maybe a couple of other events so battles you could throw in there but uh we believe that the research and everything that we put a at a put it to the book backs up that if the continental army had not survive that six month encampment\nThat they would not have been a Revolutionary War to continue fighting in in the summer of Seventeen Seventy eight or George Washington took twelve

P. P. I. dot org thank you\nWell ... was this was almost drivers in or out of character this week we're talking with Bob and Tom ... about their new book valley forge Simon and Schuster who's on the team I'm very much interested in some of the other characters in the story time they did such a good\nJob on that they you know every book has a voice that appears in your mind as you read it right in this one just falls into place and\nWe are dedicated a doorman Thomas Jefferson but one of the surprises for me was how important a figure in this valley forge story Hamilton is not just because he's Hamilton but he wrote this masterful Thirteen thousand word report which changed the whole structure of the American army\nAnd he agreed handwriting let's go back to the conversation\nThis is the Thomas Jefferson our and of course we talk a lot about Alexander Hamilton\nAnd the the squabbles between Jefferson and Hamilton and I really enjoyed some of your details about Hamilton at one point in the boy I Can't remember exactly the words used but you you explain that he's kind of a crazy warrior\nWere all these age a John Lawrence who is the founding fathers never heard of unfortunately because she was killed in the waning waning days weeks before the British were about to band in Charleston he was killed Hamilton Lafayette they all wanted they all had fish uh uh\nBanned in Charleston who was killed a Hamilton Lafayette they all wanted they all had dish uh [noise] uh this desire this burning desire\nFor battlefield honors for battlefield glory it was just a sign of the time so to speak and although I was a war correspondent for Twenty years and I saw the same thing and a lot of our ... they all look like boys to me\nAre boys in Afghanistan and Iraq or you're not fighting for Hamilton was not fighting for the concept of the United states Lawrence was not fighting for the\nNewly minted American flag\nThey were fighting for each other and when Washington finally let them loose\nOr they were too valuable to him at George Washington at valley forge for him to let them go he needed to have\nAn aids to camp not only for their\nFor their uh public duties but they helped boy him Washington did not show any emotion to his troops but in that cramped pots house headquarters\nThey could see the strain on and they could see the weight on his shoulders and have them around I think really pulled the commander in chief through this ugly horrible winter\nAnd yet as you say they strained they screen I Want to be out on the battlefield\nAnd because Washington was such a hands on general was out on the battlefield himself even as a camp they found themselves fighting on the Lawrence made a name for himself even though in defeat at the battle of German town and of course Lafayette once he was given command of a brigade he distinguished himself also\nYou also sort of been for that these were the sons that George Washington never had\nIt's interesting that the the ... the man has been known as the father of our country and by the way it was during the valley forge and kept my that phrase was first used by a German language Pennsylvania publication\nThat uh he did not have children when he when he had more if they're married he adopted her two children she was a widow that she had had with a with a late husband [noise]\nUm so he he was a he is forty six birds they took place at valley forge in in February Seventy eight\nAnd uh he was child listen and you know obviously by this point was destined to remain that way and he had these young men who were as Bob mentioned were Lafayette was twenty uh Hamilton uh Laura's twenty two going on twenty three years old\nThey were they were probably the age of Washington had sons this is the age they would have been and so and they were totally devoted to him in a way that that sons would be two two two fathers\nAnd so he he was he was devoted to them because he as Bob Said they they they Boyd him they they supported him they their their energy their idealism their loyalty their their\nTheir their desire to this burning desire for not only battlefield glory but for the cause of freedom I mean we refer a couple of times there's a chapter in which we discuss John Lawrence and refer to him as as the ideal is\nUm so I think that that we do call him a do call them surrogates sons because that's the way they were and this is a very telling moment\nIn the ballot brand new one on one level washed inland learns that Lafayette it's been wounded and or any sense of surge in up to the front defined Lafayette says treat him as if he were my own son\nAnd uh that's that's the way he felt an interesting little footnote Lafayette was also one of the few people I could look Washington the eyes because Washington was like six three six four he towered you not only not only psychologically physically towered over everybody enable him he was in\nAnd uh it was probably extra little enjoyment for him that would that would Lafayette this this this eager young man and he could take a look at each other in the eye\nOn that note of a Washington ... a project\nThis this this eager young man and he could look they look at each other in the eye\nOn that note of a Washington ... a a projection of strength so to speak or John Adams who was not a Washington fan uh he was behind that cabal that sheet\nTo replace Washington as commander in chief with ratio gates after Saratoga and he wants quipped that we only made him the commander in chief because he's the tallest guy ever roomy then yeah\nTo ... to ... I Want to go back to the lump it may have been the saber some in some ways Hamilton was ... um most ruins of the sons and I'm looking at your page one eighty eight oh Hamilton suffering from ammonia\nAnd yet these manages to do right of Thirteen thousand word um paper I'm entitled to represent the Congress\nOr to the committee of Congress in which he proposes is is a fundamental reorganization movie American Army can you talk about first of all Hamilton's ruins but also the importance of the document\nNo oh I I'll just say that a lot\nOf all the aid and not just Hamilton learns in Lafayette tension town and there were several age to Washington it was very close to the Hamilton was the one that he could almost finished Washington's thoughts\nWashington of course dictated everything eat eat it early in the war he wrote his own letters but then that just became too overwhelming and one of the reasons you hired Hamilton promoted him to lieutenant colonel it made him an aide to Capitol is because his handwriting was so good but as the to got to know each other\nWashington realized that this young man can finish my thoughts for me\nAnd although all the correspondence and I read I read close to two thousand of Washington's personal um memos personal letters public proclamation and just general orders his correspondence with Congress the continental Congress\nI read everything the man wrote are dictated between\nAh I think it was July one Seventeen Seventy seven in July Fifteen Seventeen Seventy eight\nAnd so many of them strikingly stare at the imprint of these or Alexander Hamilton starts as well as Washington's I'm not taking anything away from George Washington but Hamilton and Washington and we're on the same plane as far as uh\nAs far as knowing what they wanted and how to put it down on paper to convince other people specifically the continental Congress\nDelegate you need to be convinced they think that we're we're just lollygag in valley forge we have no food we have no weapons we have no clothes\nForeign officers who visited valley forge you'd have to volunteer their services or to just to observe were shocked\nWhen they arrived there would be centuries and when we say naked we're not talking metaphorically we're talking literally it would be an ... century wrapped in an old blanket with no shoes she'd be standing on his hat in the snow or the freezing mud Hamilton felt this Lawrence felt this\nWashington's closest age they all felt what Washington was feeling himself about this if that makes any sense I don't know if it does it\nGives you a sense of why Hamilton them later in life was on the cheap advocate for a very strong central government then to spy on Jefferson's views of states' rights local control and militia only 'til actual invasion you know you I think one of them\nThings that comes out of your book is that would almost be impossible to exaggerate the level of chaos some suffering a valley forge true\nWhen I started reading the book I thought oh you're twelve thousand\nThe drain the level of chaos and suffering a valley forge true when I started reading the book I thought oh you're twelve thousand soldiers here described for our listeners why the ... the logistics and feeding twelve thousand and clothing from from proved to be almost impossible\nWell there's several answers that one of the obvious one is the supply line was run by civilians [noise] the continental Congress had appointed civilians there was a general and ... ... at the head of the supply stem but they were run

were men of action more amount of compromising more momentum language of statesmen along you read this book and you are [laughter]\nYou understand immediately why Washington gave such weight to Hamilton's opinions Hamilton was there\nIn Lafayette was there and and one of the things I enjoy your some originals not Lafayette was the only person who could make\nGeorge Washington shed his reserve and who's\nStiffness and when he was around Lafayette he became playful physically affectionate there were some magic between Lafayette and George Washington but he actually shared with no other person I think in the whole course of his life let's let's return to the interview\nWe're talking with my ... and Tom claiming I'm their new book Simon and Schuster valley forge assassinating account here let me ask a question about\nUm Washington again because he is the central figure of the story ... when we look back and sort of without any knowledge of the revolution with the Washington movie unanimous um contested uh admired and love that's just not true in some of this unfolded\nDuring valley forge can you talk about the inter nice struggles\nWell that was that's one of the [noise] the largest discoveries I put it when we were researching a valley forge was that\nWinter of Seventeen Seventy seven Seventeen Seventy eight Washington was fighting a two front war\nIs fighting militarily against King George the third rate goats and he was fighting for his political life against the continental Congress particularly the New England faction who just wanted to replace him they wanted to serve them as commander in chief\nAnd they found their opportunity\nWhen general gates defeated the British Saratoga and gates of course was a political animal and self gates had been born in Britain\nHad fought for the British and French and indeed war and remained in the United states\nAnd he had a farm in western Virginia which death actually today it's in West Virginia and went war broke out he pledged his loyalty to the to the rebels ... United States and he kind of expect it to be named commander in chief\nHe considered and one Washington was named instead that was a political move right there the New England firebrand St John Adams Sam Sam adams and like they realize that without Virginia and the fold\nThe former colonies which now declared themselves states had no chance against the mighty British Army so in order to get Virginia the most populous state\nOr the largest state into the fold and in Washington as commander in chief and gates harbored a grudge about this as did\nA general Lee another British born officer who thought he should have been commander in chief so after the ill fated Pennsylvania campaign where Washington is just rushing willy nilly losing battles and at Brandywine creek having troops massacre it up a ... a losing the battle of Germantown\nThose whispers the continental Congress of course it led Philadelphia and most of them have had returned to their own districts but a quorum of delegates anywhere from Eighteen to twenty three at any given time had uh\nHad to return to their own districts but a quorum of delegates anywhere from Eighteen to twenty three at any given time\nHad a re Confederate it in the inland Pennsylvania town of York and whispers about Washington being a military command of being a bad military commander now they were growing there weren't whispers anymore I mean Dr Benjamin Rush who was a sign or the declaration of independence a former Washington ally he\nWrote this anonymous greed against Washington calling him a power mad dictator and a lousy general and Patrick Henry as a matter of fact recognized a Benjamin Rush is handwriting and he informed Washington who this is the kind of powerful men were trying to ask you the Washington just\nPlayed his hand he was learn to become a politician on the job much as he was learning to become a general lost his job when he was first appointed commander in chief he rushed out to buy books on\nWe're just sticks on artillery on cavalry this was stuffy had been a commander himself a militia commander during the French and Indian War but he was and he was learning on the job both militarily and politically and\nThe smartest thing he did was request that a number of delegates come out to inspect the troops at valley forge and he's five delegates shape became known as the camp committee they rode out the valley forge\nAnd when you work was eighty miles away they wrote the valley forge and when they saw the heart conditions of the troops barefoot starving and they were so embarrassed they started taking off their own shoes and giving them soldiers once they realized that Washington was not this power mad authoritarian figure\nHe was the only reason that the army was being held together\nThey started he Washington put them up in a local farmhouse and\nListed his demands but he listed them in a way that he made the congressmen this camp communities five delegates\nHe made it seem like it was their idea that we had to restructure the army and every day he would send John Lawrence or Alexander Hamilton over to the farmhouse kind of ... and\nIt came to the point where it was almost like the tail wagging the dog these\nFive delegates were Dick dating back to the continental Congress and your this is what we need this is what we have to do and he's with Washington's idea the entire time he didn't stand up and demand are so many of these emotional generals you know if you said one\nBad worried about them they wanted to do all your demand a quarter of inquiry or a court martial to clear my name Washington knew he had to play behind the scene and she had to become a political player and he it\nWe need a mini series or a blockbuster film on this story you know you describe these moments with great cinematic um vermin and drama I just see these\nThese five members of the continental Congress appearing in the sea of mud the disease and they could move some blood in squalor and I think you say that\nThey were doing it in a in a house that was near ... horses but we're running from from dying this is this is going to see in the middle of this of the smaller\nOr you are is is headed towards Hollywood\nOh well you know that that we we I think Bob and I are both a veterans of this of the writing game to know that we have no control over these things you know you it's it's it's it's like this lightning strike you know we have a\nA we have the heart of everything that is the last we heard is being developed into what could be a a mini series and uh [noise]\nAnd so with this one you know certainly uh I mean I Would certainly agree with you that I think it lends itself now in the age we have a entities like Amazon and Netflix an addition to the old the established one's more established ones like HBO or Showtime has this hungry ...\nThe age where you have a entities like Amazon and Netflix an addition to the old the established one's more established ones like HBO or Showtime has this hungry ... of looking for content\nThat ah that this would lend itself to I mean you have you have the the the founding the founding father I guess you could say in George Washington as you're central character who when you think about it and in popular culture rarely gets represented you know we we've had a film called Lincoln Lincoln as a young Abe Lincoln and Abe Lincoln of Illinois and\nYou know the Lakers been represented many many times that are an empire killer was never a film made like Abraham Lincoln vampire killer [laughter] so in the big ... and more recently the small screen there's been no lack of\nOf of of Lincoln or an\nBut George Washington rarely gets portrayed er and and I think here if you know if anybody's listening to your program that that is interested in the you have the central figure of being a very human George Washington that I keep emphasizing that because\nIt it is this isn't the George Washington who UC staring back at you from a from a piece of money\nOr for for a portrait on a museum wall this is this is George Washington with all his with all his is his fall Senate attributes in his passions and it's very very human emotions including fear and and despair\nAh and then you have surrounding him these iconic characters like Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette I met Anthony Wayne and Benedict Arnold and and and there's is there really is yes a lot of potential for ah\nAh for for a dramatic presentation of this what what we understood ah came to realize is actually a very dramatic story\nAnd just wants you to look zone on all the squalor with hints of mutiny I'm a ... struggle and cheating by the ... the prophet hearings on those at any point
