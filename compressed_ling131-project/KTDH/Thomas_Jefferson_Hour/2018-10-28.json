I think that's the model that should that should be used at any time that's practicable\nI understand Mr Jefferson we've talked of this before they ... do you must give Mr Kissinger his his do understand why he thinks this would be a good idea that the federal government is the only body that can really attempt these large scale public projects\nAre so having said that she could you explain to him in a little more detail why you think it's dangerous for the federal government to take charge of a project like this\nI Will say that the commerce clause of the constitution means that if let's say Maryland and Virginia are interested in the canal there may be some room for federal supervision about because it involves interstate commerce and commerce is one of the enumerated powers of government\nSo you're you're not going to say ... you're not completely opposed to just think it should be done with great caution\nIndeed and that I'm a strict construction is my believe in radically limited government as you know even as president by called the national government before and department I Want the states to do everything that was a practical within their own portfolio so I'm not a game\nThe national government before and department I Want the states to do everything that was a practical within their own portfolio so I'm not against this necessarily but I Do think that any time you give a grant of power to the federal government to do something like this that increases\nThe potency\nOf the national government it creates a potential monster because when you grant these powers to government government than wants other\nCorollary powers it takes tax money to make this happen the central government grows at the expense of the state governments and at the expense of local governments and even more importantly the national government girls at the expense of local volunteer initiative and then suddenly everyone's looking to the national government to solve all of our problem and I understand the point\nI understand and I take your point at the same time Mr Jefferson being a farmer and\nYou need good soil and you need water and if the federal government can in a big sense ensure that you have a supply of water I it's tough to understand why he would not want that to happen well first of all America\nIs a big country and most of it is so well water that you don't need ... leads us to make them work however if you do want to make the areas that Mr Lewis and that was only bloom with it I guess I Would hope\nThe states would handle that and the government

college the coauthor of a book called ...\nWater for a dry land three authors John Opie charm Miller and kind of lying archer good morning sir\nGood morning clay good morning when I read your book I found something really remarkable are pretty close to the\nBeginning you say you and your co authors say that while we normally think of irrigation projects in the west\nInvolving massive dams and canals and irrigation systems and the government funding at least\nYou're gauging projects in the west as involving massive dams and canals near ... systems and a government funding at least by the state of Colorado but more often by the government of the United\nStates what marks the ... irrigation system\nIs a high level of individual isn't there is not a gigantic dam that supplies this water and government at least the national government has not played much of a role in this can can you explain that\nYeah it is actually the most striking thing and and I'm like like many of us who study the west and water [laughter] we're just sort of blew my mind\nBecause it's also one of the most extraordinarily managed landscapes it's not just the individuals who are doing the work like you mentioned in your opening um and in western Kansas or northern Texas or wherever but but any of us who have ever flown across the United states you look down and you can see\nThe upside down rain what it's produced in the ... area and it's and and so in a sense it looks like the Central Valley of California 'cause it's agriculture and it's on a huge scale but the differences in Central Valley of California there every single river is damned coming out of the Sierras there are\nPumps and moving water ... ways that have been paid by the federal government pay by the state government entitled\nTo an accent local but the ... just knocked me out in terms of the degree to which\nAlmost none of this activity is funded by the federal government and you know admittedly the ... named by a USGS um geologist um but other than that you don't see much federal presence\nSo you have tens of thousands of individual farmers\nPutting down wells and creating either drip irrigation systems or a once in a while now flood irrigation systems this was done through cooperative arrangements and there is some oversight but for the most part each of these as an individual investment in prosperity\nIt has a it's an individual gamble and prosperity also I'm as the Ogallala story unfolds in the book um these folks are gambling with everything I mean whether they succeed or don't have the great dust bowl is so dramatic example of the failures\nUm that so many endured and the consequences that that flowed west as many move to places like California to try to reclaim their lives [noise] um but but\nIt it's it's a it's a gamble that clearly farmers for a very long time had been willing to make not just because they pay off his great but because they fill up the place like western Kansas or or Nebraska I'm can't imagine life elsewhere and this is just the the the thing you have to endure\nIs not only of the weather and the brutal winters but but you get to you get to um works a land in a way that is not Jeffersonian and scale\nBut if we go back to your opening and think about the Jeffersonian model of individual farmers yes these are large corporate entities that some extent but many of the people that John did the initial interviews with one the first edition came out several ... many years ago\n[noise] and these are folks who really you know put things together like the irrigation pipeline say put everything together or to produce really large scale but family controlled um enterprises\nA giant landscape in western Nebraska eastern Colorado and Wyoming in the panhandle of Texas and parts of Oklahoma New Mexico\nWould probably be able to produce some dryland wheat but maybe not every year but thanks to the ... of this has been one of the most productive farmland in North America\nSome dryland wheat but maybe not every year but thanks to the ... of this has been one of the most productive farmland in North America\nI I Would argue one of the most productive ... farm lands on the world it's it's a credible\nWhen you think about California you think about the Colorado River in the Sacramento River on whatever the downside is about sort of irrigation and these are renewable resources and I think both exactly what you really talk about now is how the law for\nAll of its abundance it's a it's a fossil lake the size of maybe Lake Huron but it is not a sustainable form of agriculture\nThat is not a sustainable form and there is where the gamble really comes in not just in the periodic drought wipe out a particular year are set up your crops are but the fact\nThat the ... has been so extraordinarily productive for now a century and let's say Twenty years or so\nBut really not since World War two when gasoline driven pumps really change the way and the pace and scale of the irrigation process sees hum that that offer that extraordinary fertile\nAwkward for with its fossil water\nHum is disappearing really quickly and at least and I don't think they're cynical I think many of the really smart sort of\nEconomic forecasts of this region\nIndicates that they think that water is gone and twenty fifty in most cases other places have already lost that and they've had to revert to dry land ack um I think that's what we're going to see over the next thirty\nForty fifty years and many places as we try to um do a bridging process and move move much of this agriculture elsewhere but it is also the depressing part of the story\nThat human beings because of our technology\nThat has unleashed such creativity has also unleash the capacity for us to destroy the very things that we were creating\nHum and as conservative as people might want to be with water um it's a little bit too late and part of it has to do with the auto while as a structure as you noticed it's not just not sustainable\nBecause we know just how crucial it is to food supplies elsewhere in the world\nGentleman we need to take a short break we'll be back in just a moment you are listening to Thomas Jefferson\nSupport comes from United Wireless serving southwest Kansas with wireless products and plans that suits your needs stores and agents across the region coverage you deserve service you expect you to wireless dot com\nThomas Jefferson Loren Jenkins is sitting across from my dear friend and least semi permanent guest host as many of the Thomas drivers are Mr Davis once and I think you have a question for our guests terminal or I Do\nFirst I Want to congratulate you on this third edition of of of the book ... water for a dry land\nThank you thank you and it is a fascinating read I Want to\nChange the subject a little bit go away from water and and talk about dirt\nAs soon as this there's this great section early in the book where you explained soils in what's perfect in the breakdown of the nutrients in how farmers during that period would recognize this perfect soil and the elements that you know I think about Jefferson and the red clay soil in Virginia\nRight right yeah and you know the language of ecological capital which I also love a you know trying to think of ways that you can capture two things simultaneously that don't\nSeem to go together I mean if you think about ecological or you don't tend to think about capital or capitalism but but the truth is that is the thing that that turns\nThat soil hum hum and as we write it turns it into a kind of miraculous balance of the chemicals and its faults and you know sodium hydrogen all these other um [noise] ... elements\nI mean it's just it's complex it's complex it's really complex\nThese these farmers during that period they recognize that they understood as we know Jefferson did Adams was a fanatic about making the best possible a manure a new Oregon he\nKnew or yeah right exactly yeah and I think that's I think that um I won't say it's a lost art but I think it is it was an art totally it was an art for them to be able to see that\nAnd I think now that we know that you can mix chemicals and produce fertility not really soil but\nFertility um we don't look at land in the same way anyway I Know you know not having grown up a farm that that was not something that ever entered my mind um but but having worked on this project for a long enough you begin to recognize that the the\nConcept the hubs husband men\nIs a really interesting term\nIf you begin to recognize that that that the concept the hubs husband men\nIs a really interesting term um all of all of this sort of you know\nPatriarchal stuff aside you really are married to and trying to produce the kind of fertile ex um landscape that's kind of whatever the crop is that you want to grow and and you you sustain it and I think those are concepts that are [noise] um\nWell I think we think our technology will save us in ways that we also see the technology produces the very thing that destroys us and I wish we could see the salvation piece more clearly in a sustained way without having blinders on to what might happen if we don't do it right\nWell you know I have some experience out there and in seems to me that the chemistry is is is far and away dominating the um\nThe stewardship of the artistry of agriculture so if you go to the right agricultural chemists that person will say if you put exceed on that field\nAnd why pesticide and Z fertilizer and our water you will produce a crop yes and yes the ... the least important part of it now that's just the medium in which it happens but it's the chemicals that are drawing on ... and they're even people out there who have tried to put chemistry\nIn the pumps themselves rather than a spray on the pesticides and herbicides with tractors\nThey've tried to put them into them into the ... the water fortunately that's mostly men um abandoned does a really really dangerous practice because those chemicals are really cheap backed down after the aquifer but I can remember going out with my father in law to to move pipe\nAnd we would actually be um at the pumps and there would be to be a ... running a top torque\nOh with almost no muscling and he would say hand me that\nThat pliers and he would be shouting at the top of his lungs to me\nFor feeling way and I will say oh God what did you say and so you have this idea it's like a\nUm a seven\nForty seven plane landing yeah and he ... things and then we think we're we're Jeffersonian farmers aren't we I mean do you think well there's Herod Oxnard or right I mean they may be individuals buts were using were the apex of a gigantic petrochemical in industrial system\nThat enables that to be a quote unquote Jeffersonian farms\nAnd and the scale as you said it was huge right and that's just one farm of thousands in that area [noise] um and it has to be that big in part because you can't I mean because of a natural precipitation chief you've got to have a lot of land that do the kind of work that you're that you hope to\nTell in some fashion but now it is the most corporate ties\nUm landscape I Would say in the end the biggest sense that is to say the the fusion of money\nAnd technology um the agricultural science is I mean all of the land grant universities and the great plains fabulous institutions are predicated\nOn teaching that it isn't the soil is simply a medium it is a means to an ad because we can we can amend we get a method to whatever we want it to be [noise]\nUm and then you've got all of the extraordinary hum combine and everything else that just frankly boggled my mind the size and scale and family and the sort of technological process sees that they\nAre able to do and the degree to which they do it it's amazing but that is not what Jefferson had in mind\nNot quite so to try and let me ask you a couple of a final questions first of all sure why did you write this book\nBut that is not what Jefferson had in mind not quite so let me ask you a final questions first of all sure\nWhy did you write this book and why do you read issue this book\nOh that's a great question so so and it and it and John ... was the original soul author of the book John us now in his eighties um and he and Nebraska felt that this was a time\nFor a third edition probably the last one um because it it so much has changed over the last Twenty years from the previous ones which cannot and to John basically finished reading at Ninety nine and it came out in two thousand two thousand and one [noise]\nSo part of the what's changed is not only the globalized nature of this agriculture but the even more clear um expectation that the Ogallala this water for a dry land\nThe water is running out and the dryness of the land is going to increase and there were sort of this really interesting moment in which we drawn fought\nAnd the University of Nebraska thought um you know this is this is a good moment to bring it out but John's health is failing hum and he felt he needed help um turn you know he called me and I said are you kidding I Love that book I'd do anything to help\nBring that book about um and then kind of laying archer who's at Angelo state is uh I'm I'm a wonderful young historian has written a beautiful book on the ... river and Texas athlete glorious piece of work\nUm we ... and you know part of what we did was to go from every one sentence after the next ... working tax reworking ideas and then\nBecause so much has happened over the last Twenty years since the second edition was to really build out an ad in\nUpdates and revising and thinking\nAt well wait a second you know they have this argument Twenty years ago where are we now and lo and behold they're still having the same argument and not much has changed in that for me was both depressing hum and regulatory because it meant that all of these conservation districts and we write a lot about a lot of them because we felt that that was a mechanism\nBy which they could be saving themselves and their future generations life on these lands\nFor all of the good work that they're able to do there is also a I'm I'm a constraint economically people want to make their money\nAnd that does as much as they might cooperate um the water is the the most essential thing to this this productive enterprise so we did a lot of reworking we talk we did a long chapter on ... key Boone Pickens who was trying to grab as much of the Ogallala in Texas as he could get his hands on keep failed\nUm but it in and of itself that's a whole nother story of who's trying to get this water and and for what purposes um and so we were really excited to put all of that together and get a chance to tell the story one more time I'm In a way that was consistent with the world that we knew it to be\nAnd then add in questions or climate change because we know a lot more today than we did that in Twenty years ago about the impact of it and you know even as this book was in its final stages production we're switching terms and\nBecause I knew things were coming out and we're trying to as close to our own time as we could um rewrite to the last moment\nWho turned this was an important book it's well written ... it's a it's\nA really I Would urge everyone to\nUh to get a copy Ogle all the water for a ...
