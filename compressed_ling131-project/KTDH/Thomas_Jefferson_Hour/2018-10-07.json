is our weekly opportunity to discuss current American events with President Thomas Jefferson seated across from me now\nGood day to you Mr President good day to use Mr Jeffrey should we have a question from one of your listeners Shawn Johnson he asked state you discuss the thoughts between particles to section was caused by thinks it's outdated\nYou familiar with that sure\nI did not write the constitution and in fact was not the constitutional convention but I think you're talking about the requirement that the president be native born in thirty five years old Yes sir I well I grew up in the British Empire I was born in the colony\nOf Virginia and the British Empire and we became the United states\nIn Seventeen Seventy six and our constitution was ratified in Seventeen eighty eight or second constitution and that's the one with this a clause in it\nI think it's important that the president be\nAn American born here\nI understand immigration them and we wanted immigrants in our time much more than you seem to want them\nIn yours we had an empty confident that we wanted to fill with people who love liberty is arguably as we do but I Do think that the president\nIs the one official elected by all of the people that's not true of a governor it's not true of a senator or congressman the president needs to have a deep connection to the heritage of this country I think that person needs to have been born here\nUm to qualify for that office\nWell it alone due to become president but there are those are in memory who could not have been president Mr Hamilton comes to mind I don't think he would have qualified\nI don't know if that has ever been fully resolved do you know he was born in the Caribbean\nYou came to this country when he was fourteen are so sponsored by his well wishers back ah in the Caribbean\nAnd he came to New York and he distinguished himself he became one of the most important American see was the de facto leader of the federalist party including in in a certain sense the shadow president during the\nThe administration of my friend John Adams\nI I think that if Hamilton had had stood for the presidency and one which he could never have won by the way but but assuming that he won\nI think we would have installed him I Do not think there would have been a constitutional test because he was born before the United states if he would be grandfathered in probably as somebody who became an American instantaneously in the fall a sense of the term on July second\nSeventeen Seventy six when we resolved independence from Great Britain I I Know people talk about his eligibility but I don't think that was the issue now let me say\nThank goodness Hamilton was number president Hamilton as a monarch host\nIs a military ... he's a corruption is he believes in the industry in banking and stock markets and so on this is not a man that that really understands are American scene he admitted so himself and in the last letter\nThat he ever wrote before his famous dual so I'm Glad that he'd never stood for the presidency if he had stood for it I don't think you could possibly have one he was too high tone\nThat he ever wrote before his famous dual so I'm Glad that he'd never stood for the presidency if he had stood for it I don't think you could possibly have one he was too high tone and a federal is to really have any popular support but I Do believe from a constitutional point of view a he his lecture and could not have been prohibited ... what about\nDuring my time sure do you think it's still applies I mean we have such a connected world now as compared to during your time or we may be missing out on some very qualified people\nMay be but I think that America is unique those who come here don't always understand us in in in the entirety of our of our dream our system our exceptionalism\nI don't think there's anything wrong with insisting upon a native born American to serve as the president of the United states I just remember from a just a few years ago in your time how much difficulty you had thinking that the sitting president might possibly have been born\nIn some other country and and how that now de legitimize them in the minds of millions of people I I I think that this is an important principle to to embrace and you know there are plenty of other roles\nFor for recent immigrants they can be in the U.S Senate they can be in the house of representatives they can be governors [noise]\nThey can do all sorts of things in this country but the presidency in my view [noise] belongs to a native born Americans so keep only American born citizens in the White House is what you're saying I Am saying that you make it sounded a liberal but I Believe that it's a very heart and soul of what it means to be an American\nThank you very much Mr Jefferson's losses\n\nSupport comes from pioneer communications keeping their communities of western Kansas connected with local telephone high definition cable

R. dot org\nManages to Thomas Jefferson city on the\nConversation with ... sauce Jeffrey ... we were speaking with President Jefferson about him as a teenager really right now talking about your intellectuals and talked about some of your teachers\nGoing back to nine years old then up to your time William and Mary Lou Williams small\nOf your next great mentor Mr George\nWith George with was a self taught Greek scholar and he was the greatest legal mind and Virginia he may have been the greatest legal mind\nIn America at the time I was so fortunate to read law with him for a number of years we had no law schools in my time one red for the law by working with the season practitioner like George with although he was better than everybody else and he\nTook me seriously as a young intellectual and it is his his message was was very straightforward he said Mr Jefferson\nYou cannot be a complete lawyer unless you are a complete human being so you must read and read deeply in the history of liberty and the history of constitutions and in the history of of the human aspiration for for freedom and happiness you should read as\nMany hours per day as you possibly can and who did you read what at his direction or ... mom to skew\nAnd Dole Bach and\nOr so and vault Tara Dr Johnson the David Hume and\nA Adam Ferguson the lord comes and goes on and on and on he said you know you will learn the law you'll be practicing the law so that will come with practice with the actual engagement with clients and in courts but but now's the time for you to become a complete human beings so that you bring a full\nMaturity to everything that follows in your life I don't think any gift could have been a greater one than that and so I read ... harder maybe during my time with George with that I had even a as a student at the college and with was\nIt's hard to say how great a Greek scholar he was you know most people in my world\nCould puzzle through some French in some life and I won't say they mastered those languages but they knew enough that they could puzzle through them\nGreek is a whole different thing you have to really want to know Greek it's a discipline\nProbably nobody in America in North or South America knew classical Greek as well as George with did\nAnd he agreed to help me master bad language which I did that\nFour or five or six years of of working every single\nHelp me master that language which I did\nThat is four or five or six years of of working every single day with extraordinary devotion memorizing a learning the congregations\nThat the Clintons the different voices in moods of the Greek language it's a different alphabet so you have to overcome that first but uh it's it's not laughed and laughed and helped to create\nModern languages including English which has an enormous number of Latin loan words Greek is is another world entirely but it's worth it let me tell you it's worth mastering ancient Greek if only to read Homer\nIn the original great but that's just the beginning of it and and this could never have happened to\nMe if I had gone to a law school of your sort or if I had um red law print just for the law with a a typical Virginia attorney of some sort\nYou are credited with a several times in your life providing lists of suggested reading for particularly for young gentleman\nYes this was when they gave me great pleasure and then people would write to me as I\nWould you I'm a man of moderate fortunes I have a following budget to spend on books would you would just sort of be willing to recommend the course of reading and and and and the additions and translations and so on the books and I would drop\nEverything to do this this was one of the happiest things that I ever got to do and if you read those lists they're very daunting because they essentially say read everything\nUp and hear the additions and ... you should purchase a four passes and Cicero into cities and Bolivia isn't Caesar and solace and and ... and\nSo on but I enjoyed this very much I always broke the budget of of the person who who who who asked these things but [noise] but you know I I guess I Want them to just to pause here to to say something that I think people in your time need\nTo know which is that thanks to Gutenberg\nThe best thoughts of humankind can be routinely and relatively inexpensively disseminated if you go to Britain college Oxford\nThe oldest library in the city of Oxford ... the the giant Foley hills are literally chained to the wall because books were so rare\nSo expensive that they that they could not allow students to smuggle them out so they changed them\nTo the wall along\nComes Gutenberg\nAnd tedious manuscript copying by hand is replaced by movable type by the time I was a young Virginia and we hadn't cheapen the costs of printing enormously and and really it was the first time that something like a mass market\nOf could be said to exist\nAnd so we have access to books I mean most people before the reformation had never held a Bible in their hands had never read the Bible in a vernacular had never read the Bible in Latin this came through priests most people and tell the seventeenth century\nCould never afford a book or get one if they could afford it and if they got one that would be some tedious biblical commentary or or or something of a very little\nActual human utility the book is the most revolutionary tool that the world has ever seen you can sit in a coffee house and there can be ten people there and each one reading a different book each one therefore\nWith a different argument with a different vocabulary with a different style a different author\nAnd each one reading a different book each one therefore with a different argument with a different vocabulary with a different style a different author a different point of view a different sensibility up by reading books we\nCan expand\nThe size of our mind um exponentially\nAnd we can expand our horizons and see things that could never be understood if you just live your life for a moment to moment in the present and so I think in your time people have begun to think less of books for some reason I Would urge you all to reconsider that because the book\nI said the book is the most revolutionary tool of all because now that it's cheaply produced it can be smuggled into despotic regimes\nAnd once the bill of rights\nOr the universal declaration of rights and France or the constitution of the United states or John Locke or Isaac Newton once these volumes maybe ... maybe in October certainly in court shows these are small enough to be placed quietly in one's luggage\nAnd they get into some\nTyrannical culture and when people have a chance to read the truth the truth as exhibited in lock second treatise on government or bowling Brooks and criticism of of received Christianity they will never asked once people have access to the truth\nThey will never rest and those cultures are going to be reformed and liberalized\nI Do have a list in front of me I'm not sure it's completely accurate but some of these lists has survived\nAnd I noticed that they they are neatly categorized in ancient history philosophy literature or a politics religion science um and there are a number of titles that to a dive recognize there are many\nThat I Do not recognize I did recognize that you have a on this list to books by Benjamin Franklin\nFranklin was our greatest scientist\nThank you very much Mr Jefferson's that cannot be a fraud sir [noise] we're going to take a short\nBreak we'll be back in just a moment listening to Thomas Jefferson\nDavis H. B. PR is executive director NPR's all things considered is a great way to hear the news of the day a great way to support HP PR is to become a sustaining member joined the mission today at H. P. P. R. dot org\nWell back to the Thomas Jefferson our weekly conversation with President Thomas Jefferson end your weekly conversation [noise] what you create the Thomas Jefferson strictly Jake hands he can last for me now David\nI have to say Jefferson was taken in by the the literary hopes of option\nWe now know that it was all fraud just begin at the beginning which was he is a young man how he began to become famous reader that he was\nHe was this brilliant young man hungry his father died when he was fourteen his father's last wish was that Jefferson be educated to the fullest extent of\nWhat the colony of Virginia could offer ... took that very seriously worshipped his late father and he had a natural capacity for learning and he did it in in in a way that makes you almost\nShake your head to think of of how deep he was into it\nI couldn't help but wonder how much different he might have been had he not met William Small or George with\nI think that he would have still been extraordinary because he had really good training you know his father's last wish essentially\nAnd then the the Scots I'm\nAngry when professors that he had these teachers that Mr Douglas and and the Reverend Mari were were excellent Jefferson's able to be a little critical of them because he's Jefferson but he he was getting a good education he almost certainly would have gone to William and Mary and even if William Small hadn't been there he probably would have had a a good education there but\nHe was a man who was who I think this is really important he was open to the idea of a mentor\nYou could say he was even looking for father's substitutes but he was open to the idea of a mentor and he was it it was impressionable you know when he would say he was a thing of wax and that these great men with them and William Small shaped him they stretch this wax into a young genius proof of\nThat is how much he put into becoming a mentor later in life he took\nThat role as you as you rightly pointed out on the program I took that very very serious but\nHe relished it was like you know an escape almost the way he talks about it the greatest funny could as well he's a lock\nThe program and he took that very very serious people that have\nRelished it was like you know an escape almost the way he talks about it the greatest funny could as\nWell he's a lucky and so he believes that man a human being is born with a blank slate ... of the ... we don't have any preconceived ideas there's nothing platonic rolling around in our heads we can be anything that you and it's like this idea of giving me this young mind and I'll\nTurn it into anything you want so Jefferson thought give me young minds and I will create ideal American agrarian intellectual\nLibertarian Republicans out of them and he just he just so thrived on being the\nTeacher the mentor to others he let people that he trusted like James Monroe actually go into his library into his private suite of rooms at my cello and and have um freedom of his library which he was very I'm skeptical about doing with pure strangers\nWhat were you know we didn't talk about that but you know it's said that he owns somewhere between nine and ten thousand books during his lifetime that's even given you a run for your money I\nThink well you know but his books mattered minor just\nThrow like he also lost libraries\nHis first one burned with the the shed wildfire in Seventeen Seventy on his second one the great library he sold the Congress and part of the deal was at the center every book he couldn't you know to pick out eight hundred that he wanted to keep you have to sell all of it and so he did keep\nA couple of it but if you had an referencing this you know he sold his sixty five hundred volume library to Congress and write a teen fourteen but when he died he the year before he died he drew up a catalog of all his books to the library of universally loved into that\nAnd at that point he had sixty eight hundred and sixty volumes so he had more than when he sold any but\nDavid thing of it this way if you said to me I have about twenty thousand bucks now if you said just take your iPhone and go down and take a picture of the spine of each\nOne I wouldn't do it Jefferson\nWrote catalog after catalog after catalogue of his books that's all ... graphical material\nYou have a I I don't believe for one moment that was worked for Jeff\nFor solid say he loves it but he must have been type a on steroids to think that's interesting because\nI mean just think of it he has ... let's just say he has his second library of about sixty four hundred volumes\nThat's each book is entitled to a long biblical graphical notation\nAndy's catalog and then so he's saying this one belongs in history and that one's mathematics on that one is a religion so you had this big Coney ... apartheid system of classification reason memory and imagination and he he just loved doing this sort of work if you said to me I'll give you\nFive hundred thousand dollars if you catalogue your library by Christmas I'd say\nAnd what is my second prize you know what if I catalogue ten bucks by Christmas\n... so before we go to this week's essay which is coming up and it's just a few minutes let's go back to the beginning and you you are almost I felt like you were on the verge of apologizing for this episode of uh the Scottish poet did you want to pick that up and you know so\nThere have been a lot of really interesting hoaxes hoaxes are really an extraordinary thing because some humans go way way way out of their way to convince others of something that's not true and here's McPherson James McPherson\nWho we now know invented option and he\nDid it so well that a lot of the world was taken in by it and it took it took some very powerful skeptics like Dr Samuel Johnson one of my heroes to see through this and to denounce McPherson\nThey took some very powerful skeptics like Dr Samuel Johnson one of my heroes to see through this and to denounce McPherson but Jefferson was just the exact sort of person who would be swept up in this because he loved the idea of a new discovery\n... it really didn't matter to them it whether it was authentic or not at some point it may be a dead but\nThere's a great book on this subject by Andrew bursting about Jefferson sentimental ... and how um susceptible he was to us in now he never as you said on the program a earlier part of the program he never got the materials he he wrote McPherson his brother and said\nI'll pay any price bearing the burden right in the blank check to borrow money you name it I just want everything you can put in my hands relating to ... [laughter] ... couldn't couldn't supply Jefferson with the apparatus that he wanted but imagine if he'd gotten that\nJefferson would have gone to what it's about a year doing everything we didn't talk about is how\nAnd then sleep popular all of this was in a today we live in a time when what's when's the last book that that rocked the world I Can't think of one\nYou know there that doesn't happen anymore but there but at this time a book could rock to the world and so it did and there was just enormous excitement about this the closest thing I can think of David is is when about Twenty years ago\nI'm I'm a German magazine published the last ... years old is your idea that they turned out it was a fraud but the world was taken in for a time and and there was this it was breathtaking everyone wanted access to this they were going to read this and this was going to be\nYour show us the inner life of a vat of Hitler and and it was going to somehow explain everything that happened\nAnd then we find out ups\nIt's literary fraud and it it produce just gigantic embarrassment in historic graphical circles\nIt's always fun to bring up and books with Mr Jefferson it's kind of like a sucker punch she how he you know you're going to have an interesting conversation with and we need to bring this conversation to a close um because it is time for this week's Jefferson watch but before we do I just want that you might want to\nHave two things W. R. I. R.\nAn independent public radio station in Ninety seven points three FM I was there giving a talk and they contacted me and said what comes out I was thrilled inside that they picked me up at my hotel we went to the station that's in this is this funky ... old building I'm On this\nAnd the interesting part of of Richmond and we went I did a couple of programs with a sunny Gardner of who is of an on air personality we had lunch and I just\nIt's so much what I admire it's\nIn a truly independent public radio they're all they said that I'm the than we are the second most popular\nNational program on their stay out democracy now has gotten ahead of us I said well we'll deal with them but it was fantastic and and let me say apropos books the two humanities retreats headlock solve lodge in January one is on books relating to water and the west\nAnd the other one is on Shakespeare so there are book centered humanities retreats people can find out more about them by going to Jefferson our dot com plus Steinbeck's a California all their Jefferson our comics books books books books books I Love to talk about reading to\nYou may now share because it is now time for this week's Jefferson watch\nLike you my friend", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Thomas Jefferson Hour", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "07"}
