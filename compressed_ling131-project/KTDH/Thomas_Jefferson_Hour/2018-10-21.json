C. to its end or during the reign of Julius Caesar the civil wars that end of the republic and then the coming of the Roman empire and all that that meant and then the collapse and\nFall of the Roman empire you know given this book the decline and fall of the Roman empire was one of the most important books of the Eighteenth century he was my exact contemporary in the first\nOf all evil that book appeared in Seventeen Seventy six so this was our obsession and what you can learn from it as a couple of things first of all\nIt takes character\nTo lead a great nation ... lives there about character\nAnd people like soul in in Greece or Kato and Cicero in Rome but the the notion is that it takes a a person of extraordinary virtue and a commonwealth vision and moral\nCourage and a deep understanding of what's at stake to lead the nation and so all of us all of the founding fathers kind of pattern themselves in one way or another after characters out of ... so there's\nThere's one element to it and another is that the Roman republic was the wasn't a democracy and anything like a modern sense of the term but it was the only culture of the angels world that really tried to understand that the people had\nSovereign rights and that the people matter that the people's will somehow be enacted and the Roman republic collapsed and so when we were building our own republic back in Seventeen Seventy six or Seventy and eighty seven we understood what could go wrong because we'd seen it\nIn the pages of Cicero we've seen it in the life of Julius Caesar\nWe saw it on the rise of Augustus the first of the autocrats\nOf the Roman empire and so we had this kind of mirror as ancient mirror that was held up to us so that said if you study this you'll know what can go wrong and maybe you'll be able to prevent it by building and more checks and balances and about our constitutional system\nFor yourselves and so so for us dangerous world wasn't just something that's interesting that happened a long long long time ago it was the most important lens through which we could look at our own experiment\nHe asks if you perhaps looked at it through rosy colored glasses or did you understand the Roman problems of poverty and brutality that that we do today\nOf course we understood this because that part of\nRoman problems of poverty and brutality that that we do today\nOf course we understood this because that part of\nAncient history is written about brilliantly by a range of different authors live ie the greatest of the Roman historians as I say ... lives are about good leaders and bad leaders corrupt leaders and virtuous leaders people for whom power\nBecomes too intoxicating people that are war mongers people that are that have great ideas but don't have the intellectual\nCourage or the moral courage to see them through a so it's not just a kind of a um a rosy ... view of a of a world that was um\nThat never existed we understood the strengths and weaknesses of the Roman republic very we're very well indeed and we understood mob rule and the lack of true representation and the economic problems of distribution that just rocked\nA the Roman world so we were not in any way naive about this I think you could say this we were naive perhaps in believing that there was a one to one parallel between what happened back then and what was happening to us after all Rome was a a city state on a peninsula in the Mediterranean we are America\nWith the west that goes on and on a novel the Rocky Mountains and probably\nTo the Pacific coast so you would encourage Americans of my time to study rolling history yes and uh the way to start is to read the lives of the Roman leaders in foods are they're short they're highly entertaining and

it's what in the enlightenment was known as a cabinet of curiosity is a kind of private museum and Jefferson\nCanals and roads but that because that would be a stalking horse for\nThe federal government's claim that it could rule on slavery both in the existence slave states and and the territories and incoming states and that he regarded that as incompatible with the values that he believed that the values of\nThe revolution [noise] gentleman we need to take a short break we'll be back in just a moment we're speaking with professor Joseph Ellis about his new book American

areas and I now heading they've been diamond for many years that radio station availability very very limited and you don't get very much commentary\nUm I think it's very important especially in the rural areas [noise]\nWalking by Thomas Jefferson are we're having a conversation with Dr Joseph Ellis author of many extraordinary books on the founding generation\nIncluding the award winning founding brothers this time about his latest book published in October of twenty Eighteen American by law the founding fathers in less than we have a bunch of questions to ask about one let's let's return to the conversation so here's the grade Joseph\nEllis thing it was a sad and pathetic spectacle and then you go on to say\nThat Jefferson wanted so much for us to be a Republican\nOr a unique experimental government in which the people were actually saw room and to an extent unprecedented in human history govern themselves and the the greatest architect of that vision\nAnd the second half of his life and particularly in the last two decades actually gave his mighty energies to the self destruction of that very concept because he was so paralyzed by his racism in by his complicity in slavery that is such a powerful argument\nJefferson envisioned the civil war in his mind as a possibility but\nHe believed that it was the north that was causing that potentially occur by insisting on slavery as an as an institution that had to be removed and um and Jefferson said\nThis is a threat to the chapter I guess that I too expected slavery and and I believe that is incompatible with the values of the American revolution\nHowever has to happen in a certain way if for it to work and one of the ways that has happened is each state needs to decide this on its own but secondly we need to have a plan to remove all the freed slaves from the continent of North America or from the United states\nUm before we implement any kind of emancipation plan\nYou've been at this for a long time and when I first met you ah we were up the American idol ... society and then we were income burn shop in New Hampshire and at that time you were\nI think it's I Hope I'm not miss characterizing you you were less severe about Jefferson than you have since become so can you tell us a little bit about the trajectory of your historical thinking on this subject\nSevere is probably not of a wrong word I don't like it but I I I understand why you use it\nThat I'm at the time I wrote a\nAmericans fangs when you and I got to know each other and weed coke consulted with Ken Burns on his documentary I keep things have changed one is that I've become more aware that I was dead\nOf the existence\nOne is that I've become more aware that I was the end\nOf the\nExistence and pervasive influence of race in America\nI thought we were on a path after the civil rights movement that would gradually inevitably terrorists to some form of bi racial justice\nMy ironically that the civil rights movement and the legislation of the early sixties civil rights acts of sixty four sixty five merely said we're going to actually implement the decisions we made after the civil war and the fourteenth fifteenth amendment\nAnd we just waited a hundred years to do it um but that in that sense I thought that Martin Luther king was right when he said that the arc of a moral universe or moves towards justice\nAnd I still think that's true and some long term sense but I think that the real pattern in America is backlash and we're in a ... black lash moment\nYou start this book Joe are you in your introduction it's almost as if you're a I don't want to say making an excuse or apologizing but ... you're using history then and now which is kinda different for you yes and the introduction ends with given the current condition is a deeply divided people my hope is that the founding\nEra can become a safe\nPlace to gather together not so much to find the answers to those questions as to argue them indeed if I read the founders right their greatest legacy is the recognition that argument itself\nIs the answer it sets the book up quite well sir\nWell that's what I really believe and um I think the first ... the ... or whatever we call it in the book I'm Talking to the reader and saying that I'm going to do something here that I haven't done before and that professional historians aren't supposed to say that they're doing\n[noise] professional story that I Am a professional historians car you are [laughter] um that were trained to to say and believe that the past as a foreign country\nAnd we're like anthropologist moving through time you don't want to go to to mow and say how come you guys aren't practicing the child rearing uh procedures of doctor Spock\nOkay um and similarly historians are not supposed to bring their convictions in values and present to bear on the past we want to go back and recover in its own terms\n[noise] we're not capable of objectivity because we're not mathematicians or physicists but work perhaps capable and detachment\nAnd at least that's the goal we have to get as close to as possible\nAnd therefore we should resist writing from the president to stick and the word present to stick his bed term in American history and history you know like your present to stick means you're just\nImposing so I got to go back and look at ... percent and find out whether or not he's an evangelical Christian let's and um and you cherry pick the evidence to find that\n[noise] but my view is that in that even detachment is a delusion namely that we are only capable of looking\nBack at than from now and it is inevitable that we either consciously or unconsciously\nBring our own values and convictions and troubles to that particular endeavor so that Charles beard looks back from the high point of the progressive movement in Nineteen Thirteen at the founders and what does he discover Pluto talk or see on there\nIn Denver so that Charles beard looks back from the high point of the progressive movement in Nineteen Thirteen at the founders and what does he discover Pluto talk or see on the robber barons\nArthur Schlesinger looks back at Nineteen in Nineteen thirty seven at Jackson and the Jacksonian America and why does he discover\nFDR and the new deal\nNow those are two great books by the way that it's their emblematic of the way in which it is virtually impossible for any historian to be completely detached\nAnd instead of saying okay ... I'm saying let's make a virtue of that and self consciously identify the problems of our president and use that as a prism through which to look at the past and be honest about an open about it\nHonest you are sure I mean I I look at the book and I go back to that at this this positive constructive statements that a recognition that argument itself is the answer and you using a this historical period you know best at a book\nYou we have chapters on a Jefferson Adams Madison and Washington and you put some pretty difficult troops out about all of them and then you sort of analyze it at the end of each chapter by going to now I was left feeling very positive I thought it was very constructive\nThat's very Jeffersonian of you I'm Glad you did that I think that that there are other books that have come out recently there's one by John ... the other another from I'm Doris Kearns Goodwin that are attempting to look back at the past from our world here in Donald Trump's America and\nWhat ... both of them do is is\nIf they do quite well and I recommend books and they find an optimistic story to tell this is a sense they say that we face great crises before\nWe'll get through men and and we've always gotten through and and and that the phrase that ... calls on this the better angels of our nature um\nAnd I know John and I said he's not a sentimental is that I Would say to him if he were product you know that John remember he gave that speech in first inaugural march Eighteenth sixty one and the next day South Carolina seceded from union\nIndeed forgive me gentlemen Joe if you could hold your answer to that question for just a moment to take a short break we'll be right back you're listening to Thomas Jefferson\nSupport comes from stars seeking treatment against real suicide dedicated to suicide prevention and awareness how about an eight year old six or seven six Ninety eight eighty to stand against suicide is on Facebook\nAnd looking back at the Thomas Jefferson our we're talking with Joseph Ellis one of our nearest friends back by popular demand and now I'm about to begin a book tour of this country with his new volume American dialogue founding fathers in us\nI must say too I I I I watch the during a your extensive discussions with the festival is about the Jefferson ... it was a bit of Haiti and I do feel pain you know because\nThere's a disillusionment\nAs I've said many times everyone who knows ... eventually becomes an Adam's light\nIncluding you and to me and\nIf you want to look at Jefferson as a racist an apartheid system and it with an intellectual voluptuous area in an unrealistic guy who was dreaming about America that never existed\nThat's easy to do and it's true\nSome sense Jefferson is a nuisance because he tried to pitch our our national experiment in this in late in the world that doesn't exist in Adams kept saying\nCome on high end nuts I look around lately that's how people are greedy they're selfish they rapacious there say actually who is a little bit more eloquent than I thought you know what I Do at us and so\nAnd so if you want to look at ... through that lens he's the easiest mark of all of the founding fathers because he just sets himself up pieces that all men are created equal he said you know given the choice between newspapers in government and all that stuff he all he sets himself up as\nIn our time our time of profound disillusionment as a kind of many but we know that's not true we know the Jefferson is the is the is the architect of the very essence of what it is to be an American that sense of freedom\nAnd optimism and possibility and that we're we're going to set the tone for the whole human project in the world and that if we get it wrong and more on the road to getting it right\nAt education is the answer and people they have their hands in the soil people will flourish in the world and we needed some divided and subdivided again or or units of government so that we have citizen participation and citizens are up to the challenge was Jefferson's view that ultimately the ...\nDivided again or or units of government so that we have citizen participation and citizens are up to the challenge was Jefferson's view but ultimately the people are up to the challenge and I think that either one or two things I really want to boils down to his Jefferson believed people were up to the challenge Adam said I\nLooked around [laughter] yeah but but they both have a point either Jefferson is right and I think he is right and we need more education and so on and so forth to make it happen or Jefferson is wrong but we still need to believe that to be America we still have to have hope and optimism in that sense of you know what we can master life one of the questions\nI still enjoy that us as you said if we could bring any of these founders\nBack who would help all males that America will save that for the end you'll see gave rise did\nBut let's go back to the question you ask before our break who was a lengthy question about the differences between Adams and Jefferson\nAt everything you just said is what I think and what I say I'm In my application of it is that they are having an argument about whether or not freedom and equality are compatible\nAnd whether or not the traditional distinction between the few and the many the address the way and goes popularly that has dominated most of European history is going to be replicated in the United states ... percent believes that once you do away with prime agenda turn entail\nAnd once you have a continent that's it's not an occupied by the way but it's an extraordinarily fertile how will call an empty we begin with a trust fund that no other new nation ever begins with in terms of\nThe available land and the fertility of the land and the irrigation patterns of the rivers that cetera et cetera I mean nobody knew that but the middle west in the United states is most fertile ground a fertile land of that size in the world\nUm and no other nation has the river system in the United states does\nUm they didn't even know that you know Jefferson thought that might be dinosaurs out there\n[laughter] but um master that's yeah ... but that I'm a ... Adams is that now\nThat's all going to and then when it does I mean when they become more urban and uh one of the population increases\nUm we're going to say that the freedom and equality or not compatible and in our terms in terms of our president I mean that\nIf you believe the market should be given to complete freedom to function and you can quote pursue your happiness there without restraint the net result will be oligarchy include taco see\n'cause that's what always happens in Europe\nAnd that's what's gonna happen here any turns out to be right in the first gilded age which starts in the late Nineteen century and ends officially Nineteen twenty eight um\nAnd and we're now in a second gilded age which started in Nineteen eighty and we now have in Nineteen excuse me in two thousand H H we surpassed the high point of inequality that we had reached before and the first gilded age in Nineteen twenty eight\nAnd this is it's incredible I mean some some nice to talk about this more but the nation that invented the middle class society\nNo long and now is has the highest level of economic inequality of any advanced society and the world we are no longer a middle class society\nUm now because everybody in America is somehow part of the middle class because we just such an such a big term but that the what was the diamond has become a triangle and the top ten percent and much further up you go ...\nThe what was the diamond has become a triangle\nAnd the top ten percent and much further up you go especially the one percent and then beyond that to the point one percent I mean the top ten hedge fund makers make five times as much money than all the kindergarten teachers in the United states\nUm and that Adams is saying ... Adams does not have an answer to that problem what Adams is saying is that there isn't negotiation that has to occur between what we would now call capitalism and now called democracy\nIn in this book tour you're gonna do you're going to be on lots of media now a ... one of the questions you really want to be asked about this book what what do you want to be liberated in your own discourse within the next three months\nI'm not just being complimentary that nobody will be as good a question or as you've just been\nBut surely you have this idea that asked me about this America because I'm ready to say this and grounded the country\nYeah you'd asked me the the racial questions are very important and I expect to be asked them and I hope I am the income inequality too\nI'm In the current debate over the Supreme Court I expect some questions about constitutional a\nTheory and the originalist position which is Kavanaugh's position and I'm prepared to talk about that in ways that are being provocative that I think the origin list are preposterous lay wrong you Tom\nAnd um and in foreign policy which we haven't talked much about um\nUh it's the key figure is Washington and the\n... the ... not the question I wanted to ask me is what is what did American exceptionalism means then and what does it mean now it's exactly the opposite\nNow by American exceptionalism we mean the world is ready for us to sort of decide it the rule and in America has a privileged position and an obligation to expand its liberal values throughout the world\nThe founders thought that they didn't use they say we're a unique but precisely because we were a unique Washington didn't think that the model of society we had was going to be transported to the rest of the world\nAnd didn't think it was going to work in France for example in the French Revolution but the notion that we're going to sound is set up a Jeffersonian democracy in the middle of Iraq\nThat is out of the question that's never going to work and that's the view of exceptionalism they had\nAnd so let me ask you this um kinda last question about this goes to Madison because um you know in some ways Madison was the greatest of the founders he's the least entertaining maybe of the founders but a profound thinker he was\nJumper some Aristotle keeping drivers and grounded in some some some real world I agree with that so you're projecting forward from James Madison and these other founders take a look at us now\nWith our paralyzed Congress or politicized courts or tribal Muslim So the idea of Newtonian checks and balances and the kind of wonderful machine that would go of itself the\nMadison helped craft vacuum some if you looked around that this thing to say\nHey what he's saying be what's the remedy\nWell of course he's dead and he's busy being dead so he can't come out and talk to us but if you read them and try to figure out\nI mean he an Eighteen twenty nine he said I expect this document that I helped to create the last four at most a hundred years I think that he would say you know that we have to rethink this basic structure of the constitution\nEven if he walked away and in September Madison did say we failed\nAnd not and Hamilton tried to say no we got as much as we could end up in the very things that most upset Madison initially changed his mind on in the federalist papers now so that the ambiguities of the document as it's great strengths", "show_name": "Thomas Jefferson Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "21"}
