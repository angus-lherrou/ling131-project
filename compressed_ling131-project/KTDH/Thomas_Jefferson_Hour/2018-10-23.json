California do you think about the Colorado River in the Sacramento River on whenever the downside is that sort of ... or renewable resources moving exile I Want you really talk about now is how the owner Lola for\nAll of its abundance it's a it's a fossil lake the size of maybe Lake Huron but it is not a sustainable form of agriculture\nIs not a sustainable form and there is where the gamble really comes in not just in the periodic droughts that wipe out a particular year are set up your crops\nBut the fact that the ... has been so extraordinarily productive for now a century and let's say Twenty years or so but really not since World War two when gasoline driven pumps really changed the way and the\nPace and scale of the irrigation process sees hum that that offer that extraordinary fertile\nAwkward for with its fossil water\nHum is disappearing really quickly and at least and I don't think they're cynical I think many of the really smart sort of economic forecasts of this region\nIndicates that they think that water is gone and twenty fifty in most cases other places have already lost it and they'd have to revert to dry land ... um I think that's what we're going to see over the next thirty\nForty fifty years and many places as we try to um do a bridging process and move move much of this agriculture elsewhere\nBut it is also the depressing part of the story\nThat human beings because of our technology\nThat has unleashed such creativity has also unleash the capacity for us to destroy the very things that we were creating\nHum and as conservative as people might want to be with water um it's a little bit too late and part of it has to do with the auto while as a structure as you noticed it's not just not sustainable\nIn terms of how we're dealing with it it also doesn't regenerate at a speed that anybody can forecast\nAs you notice that it's not just not sustainable in terms of how we're dealing with it it also doesn't regenerate at a speed that anybody can forecast or or watch\nIt I Will say like one or two inches per year regenerate yeah\nWhich is you might as well not regenerate um and actually the the the line that we use in the text or in the new book is\nThat if you turned off every single ... if you turned off and every um flood irrigation and drip irrigation [noise] uh no more water was pumped out of the ... at all\n\nHealth care is a problem that people in the district fates every single day in New Jersey with fewer than three weeks until the midterms repealing Obamacare is a major issue in a hotly contested congressional race and the issue is leading many voters on the fence\nA I don't know I'm ... I'm a little bit on the\nThat one I'm not sure that's on the next MORNING EDITION Tuesday Morning beginning at five central\n\nThat one I'm not sure that's on the next MORNING EDITION Tuesday Morning beginning at five central\n\nLevel in almost ... sitting across from my dear friend them these semi permanent guest host as me of the promise drivers arms to David Swenson I think you have a question for our guests terminal or I Do\nFirst I Want to congratulate you on this third edition of of of the book overload water for a dry land\nThank you thank you and it's just fascinating I Want to\nChange the subject a little bit go away from water and talk about the dirt and\nAs soon as this there's this great section early in the book where you explain soils and what's perfect in the breakdown of the nutrients in how farmers during that period would recognize this perfect soil and the elements that you know I think about Jefferson and the the red clay soil and Virginia\nRight right yeah and you know the language of ecological capital which I also love 'em you know trying to think of ways that you can capture two things simultaneously that don't\nSeem to go together I mean if you think about ecological or you don't tend to think about capital or capitalism but but in truth that is that is the thing that that turns that soil um [noise]\nUm and as we write it turns it into a kind of miraculous balance of the chemicals and its faults and and you know sodium and hydrated and all these other um [noise] ... element I mean it's\nJust it's complex it's complex it's really complicated\nThese these farmers during that period they recognize that they understood as we know Jefferson did you don't Adams was a fanatic about making the best possible a manure a newer again he\nKnew or yeah right exactly yeah and I think that's I think that um I won't say it's a lost art but I think it is it was an art\nTotally it was an art for them to be able to see that and I think now that we know that you can mix chemicals and produce fertility not really soil fertility\nUm we don't look at land and the same way anyway I Know you know not having grown up a farm that that was not something that ever entered my mind um but but having worked on this project for a long enough you begin to recognize that the the\nConcept the hub husband then it's a really interesting term um all of all of a sort of you know\nPatriarchal stuff aside you really are married to and trying to produce the kind of fertile\n... um [noise] landscape that's kind of whatever the crop is that you want to grow and and you you sustain it and I think those are concepts that are [noise]\nUm well I think we think our technology will save us in ways that we also see the technology produces the very thing that destroys us\nAnd I wish we could see the salvation piece more clearly in a sustained way without having blinders on to what might happen if we don't do it right\nYou know I have some experience out there and it seems to me that the chemistry is is is far and away dominating the um\nThe stewardship of the artistry of agriculture so if you go to the right agricultural cameras that person will say\nIf you put exceed on that field and why pesticide and Z\nFertilizer and our water you will produce a crop yes and yes oil in some senses the least important part of it now that's just the medium in which that happens but it's the chemicals that are drawing on the ...\nAnd they're even people out there who have tried to put chemistry in the pumps themselves rather than a spray on the pesticides and herbicides with tractors they've tried\nTried to put chemistry in the ... themselves rather than a spray on the pesticides and herbicides with tractors they've tried to put them into them into the ... fortunately that's mostly men um abandoned does a really really dangerous practice because those\nChemicals are really cheap back down to the ... but I can remember going out with my father in law to to move pipe\nAnd we would actually be um at the pumps and there would be to be a ... running a top torque\nWith almost no muscling and he would say hand me that\nThat pliers and he would be shouting at the top of his lungs to me for feeling way and I will say oh God what did you say and so you have this idea it's like I'm I'm a seven forty seven plane landing yeah\nAnd ... and then we think we're we're Jeffersonian farmers aren't we think well there's Herod Oxnard or right I mean they may be individuals buts were using were the apex of a gigantic petrochemical and industrial system\nThat it may not to be a quote unquote Jeffersonian farms\nAnd and the scale as you said it was huge right and that's just one form of thousands in that area [noise] um and it has to be that big in part because you can't I mean because of a natural precipitation chief you've got to have a lot of land to do the kind of work that you're that you hope to\nTell in some fashion but no it is the most corporate ties\nHum landscape I Would say in the end the biggest sense that is to say the the fusion of money\nAnd technology um the agricultural science is I mean all of the land grant universities and the great plains fabulous institutions are predicated\nOn teaching that it isn't the soil is simply a medium it is a means to an ad because we can we can amend that we get a method to whatever we want it to be um and then you've got all of the extraordinary hum combine and everything else that just\nFrankly boggled my mind the size and scale and family and the sort of technological process sees that they\nAre able to do and the degree to which they do it is amazing but that is not what Jefferson had in mind\nNot quite so let me ask you a couple of a final questions first of all sure why did you write this book and why do you read issue this book\nOh that's a great question so so and it and it and John ... was the original soul author of the book John us now in his eighties um and he and Nebraska felt that this was a time\nFor a third edition probably the last one because it it so much has changed over the last Twenty years from the previous ones which cannot and to John basically finished reading at Ninety nine and it came out in two thousand two thousand and one [noise]\nSo part of the what's changed is not only the globalized nature of this agriculture but the even more clear um expectation that the Ogallala this water for a dry land the\nWater is running out and the dryness of the land is going to increase and there were sort of this\nReally interesting moment in which we drawn fought\nAnd the University of Nebraska thought um you know this is this is a good moment to bring it out but John's health is failing [noise] um and he felt he needed help um turn you know he called me and I said are you kidding I Love that book I'd do anything to help bring that book about\nUm and then kind of laying archer who's at Angelo state is uh I'm I'm a wonderful young historian has written a beautiful book on the ... river in Texas athlete glorious piece of work I'm we wrote current and you know part of what we did was\nAnd has written a beautiful book on the ... river and Texas athlete glorious piece of work I'm we wrote current and you know part of what we did was to go from every one sentence after the next ... working tax reworking ideas and then\nBecause so much has happened over the last Twenty years since the second edition was to really build out an ad in\nUpdates and revising and thinking at well wait a second you know they had this argument Twenty years ago where are we now and lo and behold they're still having the same art and that and not much has changed in that for me was both depressing\nUm and regulatory because it meant that all of these conservation districts and we write a lot about a lot of them because we felt that that was a mechanism by which they could be saving themselves and their future generations life on these lands\nFor all of the good work that they're able to do there's also a I'm I'm a constraint economically people want to make their money\nAnd that does as much as they might cooperate um the water is the the most essential thing to this this productive enterprise\nSo we did a lot of reworking we talk we did a long chapter on ... key Boone Pickens who was trying to grab as much of the ... in Texas as he could get his hands on he failed\nA but it in and of itself that's a whole nother story of who's trying to get this water and and for what purposes um and so we were really excited to put all of that together and get a chance to tell the story one more time\nI'm In a way that was consistent with the world that we knew it to be\nAnd then adding questions or climate change because we know a lot more today than we did that in Twenty years ago about the impact of it and you know even as this book was in its final stages production we're switching terms and\nBecause I knew things were coming out and we're trying to as costs to our own time as we could um rewrite to the last moment", "show_name": "Thomas Jefferson Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "23"}
