[noise]\nSo you start playing in the church give me a little bit of your history as growing to this moment\nI mean I grew up singing in church in like sitting in for me was just something that we all did it wasn't something that I was going to do for a living and I want to play basketball and so I Want to go to college and play ball and do all that kind of stuff and then I started getting probably like when I was like sixteen\nSeventeen around that started the interviewer basketball my senior year too so I didn't play my senior year and then that's when I really started getting to the ideal way I'm not going to go to college to play ball but I can go to college for music I mean that's kind of when I really started falling into the idea is being a professional singer I wanted to be a jazz singer like so many of those\nAre my predecessors and\nThe people that have kind of indirectly indirectly spoken to who I Am as art is like what I wanted to be a jazz singer like Nat King Cole right that's where I Am cook one and that's with Ray Charles Warner and that's when Marvin Gaye money and eventually\nThrough he and the other individuals you know found my own voice I think I'm getting closer to really finding out who I Am\nVocally barring from a lot of people most of the things I'm doing my life right now I never really was intended on doing it I didn't plan anything heart is just like to see what happens I'm obviously I'm finding a better balanced with that because you can't run a non profit and not playing I just want to know how did you\nGet to all the things you could have done that you chose Johnny Cash it was it was kind of on accident so I had a concert series in St Louis called the master series and I was doing artist who had an influence on me\nAnd the approach was to treat them as if they were a college course and I was getting my doctorate and then so I was like really want to study um so it's like Rachel I'm always reading Sam Cooke and Marvin Gaye\nAnd then for some reason around the same time I was getting to try and get it you know like I Love him as a writer I connect with Johnny Cash on so many different levels especially when the ... from the spiritual side in\nA loved the him that he did with ... brothers in the car to family I'm like man I'm going to Johnny Cash show so when I did the show\nYou know I always try to stay true as I could to the way that the artist performed it from for the most part\nWhich was easy for the other stuff 'cause a lot of it was already in my voice now I Do a decent Johnny Cash but the problem is that unlike the other artist that I mentioned his voice was lower than mine and so there was a part in the show where it was walk the line where it keeps modulating\nAnd I was like I cannot go down like I Can't what am I going to do so literally in the show I was like you know anybody remember the shows the empty crossroads ... I was like well you know it would've been so cool to do crossroads of Johnny Cash I Wonder what would it\nYou know anybody remember the shows the emcee crossroads ... I was like well you know it wouldn't be so cool to do crosswords with Johnny Cash I Wonder what would it sound like if I if we did that well let's find out tonight so to get around\nThe lower modulation I Would just seeing it the octave up in my own voice\nSo someone came up to me after the show and they said\nI Love the show everything was great my favorite part is when you sane Johnny Cash and your own voice I Would love to hear you do a whole show or an album will you just named Johnny Cash in your voice yeah so for this entire record\nThe keys are the same as Johnny is the only thing I did is I changed the field and I think up Dr let's say I don't do roads I don't do I just like\nIn really it really helped me further to discover\nMy voice in a deeper sense of who I Am as a vocalist because it wasn't there is no comparison the busing Marvin Gaye there's comparison yeah if I if I Would do the\nSam Cooke record our neck in coal record this comparison because so much of the pallet of my voice is made up of those colors when I say the Johnny Cash is nothing compared to 'cause I Can't think of like him so truly I had to get like myself\nHere's more from Brian and one's in the ... the soul live on ... street here again like I said when\nTwo for my soul to cast record for\n[noise]\n\n\n... me [noise] [noise]\nOh you're so close to watch on this fall on the line I keep my eyes wide open all the time I came then uh all", "show_name": "Beale Street Caravan", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "13"}
