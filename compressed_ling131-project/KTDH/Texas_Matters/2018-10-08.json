{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTDH", "content": "The other recommendation was we needed more down ballot candidates it's such a big state\nThat and we have plenty of Democrats in the state people that are concerned about public education and healthcare and so forth but it takes down ballot candidates to move voters to the polls and that was the biggest challenge I thought coming into two thousand Eighteen but because of what's happening in our political environment you know in a large sense lots of really good\nOrdinary Texans decided to jump in and compete because they're concerned about our country and so we got a lot of great down ballot democratic candidate Steven clean for example is running for the Senate here in the San Antonio area against on a Campbell that's right\nThat's right and so what that means is that\nThe Democratic party message is much more local than it's been it's much more economic uh economics oriented than it's been it resonates much more with voters and so it's it's showing in the polls I mean we're a in low single digits\nWith several weeks to go so it looks very different in two thousand Eighteen\nSo you're thinking that a blue wave will be hitting taxes and would raise your campaign maybe be able to beat the ...\nFor the Senate here in the San Antonio or against on a Campbell that's right that's right and so ... what that means is that\nThe Democratic party message is much more local than it's been it's much more economic uh economics oriented than it's been it resonates much more with voters and so it's it showing in the polls I mean we're a in low single digits\nWith several weeks to go so it looks very different in two thousand Eighteen\nSo you're thinking that a blue wave will be hitting taxes and would raise your campaign maybe be able to beat the Twenty years drought that we've had with Democrats\nWell you know I don't I personally don't use the term blue wave because it\nSuggests that it's really a an anti Trump movement ah I really don't see it that way frankly uh it's true that Trump stimulated a lot of Democrats to run for office but what's really going to drive the output a in a few weeks time is the fact that the people that came out to run\nBecause the Trump and how they felt about democracy\nOr not running against Trump they're running on local issues are and it's resonating with voters and so yes I Do think that we have a very good chance of winning in a few weeks time\nWill win a ... an incumbent runs for office like lieutenant governor Dan Patrick is running for office and you're challenging him we we generally look at it as whether or not voters want to fire the incumbent and what is Dan Patrick done that does he deserves to be fired for\nWell there are hundreds of thousands of retired teachers that are absolutely as mad as hornets and they ought to be because they had their health care benefits cut dramatically and we've got retired teachers out there who can't afford their medicine I mean there's a real crisis there's hundreds of thousands of them I meet with them everywhere I go\nUh teachers are very unhappy at what's happening in public education or class sizes are getting larger we don't have enough special education teachers in the classroom um they've gotten smaller raises along the way but the cost of healthcare\nBurns up those raises and so they feel very disrespected they're very dissatisfied with with teach to the test and they lay a lot of this blame it Dan Patrick's feed 'em and of course parents are unhappy\nWith their students in public schools are those that are concerned about school safety are very dissatisfied with Dan Patrick because he blocked the governor's initiatives to increase school safety so if you add up all the retired teachers and all the teachers and all the parents and then you've got all the property tax payers\nUh who really aren't being told truthfully what's happening\nOr there's a lot of anti Dan Patrick's sentiment out there which is one of the reasons why our campaigns doing so well\nWhat are the issues that dad Patrick tried to um propel his campaign with is the bathroom bill\nA so called bathroom bill in which she um was pushing for the last legislative session which would have made a requirement or would have made it illegal for anyone to go to a public restroom\nThat didn't uh correlate with their gender birth um that was\nYou know a big talked about issue people said it was bad for business and taxes people's called it a ... anti transgender um where are you on that\nI'm against it it I I was offended by it I thought it was one of the most hateful publicity stunts that I've ever seen it's not a real issue the only time Texans are concerned about is when Dan Patrick is flapping his jaws or by the vast majority of Texans think that that was overreach that it was hateful that it was a publicity stunt\nEven just around somebody that I really expert respected mar a sauce through it as a as just a hateful publicity stunt and he's doing it again a which is unconscionable and let me look at it let me I mean from a business perspective I can tell you didn't mean he's doing it again well he's revving up the base and he's talking about he's when he campaigns which is rare\nOr he's talking about the bathroom and again and he's going to bring it\nThese stunts that I've ever seen it's not a real issue the only time Texans are concerned about is when Dan Patrick is flapping his jaws or by the vast majority of Texans think that that was overreach that it was hateful that it was a publicity stunt\nEven just around somebody that I really express respected mar a sauce through it as a as just a hateful publicity stunt and he's doing it again or which is unconscionable and let me look at it let me I mean from a business perspective I can tell you I mean he's doing it again well he's revving up the base and he's talking about he's winning campaigns which is rare\nOr he's talking about the bathroom but again and he's going to bring it back um there are certain endorsing organizations that aren't going to endorse him because he he refuses to give up on the bathroom bill and Texans don't want it and as I say you know nobody's talking about it\nAre worried about it because it's not real except when Dan Patrick flaps his jaws about it and he's trying to do it for political reasons and let me say this you know\nWe have a real school safety issue\nAnd gun safety issue it wouldn't would not call a special session our schools are no less dangerous now than they were\nWhen Santa Fe happened he would not call a special session for that we had to use a lot of Governor Greg Abbott who calls a special session well I mean let's talk about that the governor cause a special session and governor actually suggested that we have a special session related to gun safety after they headed round table\nBut he said they will only be a special session if there is a political will to get something done and Dan Patrick said there is no political will we will not do it so there was no point\nIn calling a special session that true lieutenant governor does not have the legal authority to call a special session but the lieutenant governor can demand a special session and then Patrick he's done the exact opposite\nSo in jail so damned Patrick is talking about he's going to protect the second amendment gun rights is this what he means is what he's talking about\nWell let's talk about the second amendment or you know I'm a gun owner right so I you know when I was younger I was a deer hunter my dad and I used to go deer hunting and I've got the rifle that I bought using paper out money I liked that rifle or a and I'm pro Second Amendment all the way\nAnd background check system that works is consistent with the second amendment as is a red flag law and that's what the governor said that we should be considering an expert Texans want including many Republicans are because we've got to do something sensible\nAh about gun safety damn Patrick block that and that is inconsistent with the will of the state and it's not a Second Amendment argument you can have a red flag law just as we already have other laws\nAre related to gun safety are that are consistent with the second amendment\nRed flag laws me that there are indicators to show that this is a person who would be a danger to himself or others uh it's in other states of it seems to be a trend But Dan Patrick is opposed\nWell let's think about what how a red flag law actually works I mean you must protect the second Amendment rights that's essential the red flag laws do that uh we let me put it to you this way we already have laws on the books for example that's that's if somebody's a\nConvicted of violent crime with a handgun they are not allowed to carry a gun that laws already on the books were all living\nComfortably with that no one is claiming that's inconsistent with the second amendment what a red flag law is says that you can accelerate that process so if you think that somebody is a danger to themselves or others\nAnd you have competent evidence of that and you take it before an independent judge\nThe independent judge can issue in order that temporary until you decide whether or not there should be some sort of permanent injunction and so really all it is is taking the laws that are on the books as we find them and accelerating the process which I think is perfectly sensible\nIs Texas matters I'm David Martin Davies I'm speaking with my colleague here the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor another Dan ...\nIt says that you can accelerate that process so if you think that somebody is a danger to themselves or others\nAnd you have competent evidence of that and you take it before an independent judge the independent judge can issue in order that temporary until you decide whether or not there should be some sort of permanent injunction and so really all it is is taking the laws that are on the books as we find them and accelerating the process\nWhich I think is perfectly sensible\nThis is Texas matters I'm David Martin Davies I'm speaking with my colleague here the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor another Dan Patrick position is securing the border what a securing the border I mean to you Mike Collyer democratic candidate for lieutenant governor\nWe all agree that we should secure the border we all agree that we should control the border we all agree that we must enforce the laws of the United states of America\nThe difference between me and the and Patrick is that we should be intelligent about it so we should do what works uh and we should be humane about it I mean there's no question about it this notion that we tore children away from their families was a terrible thing to do\nUm that that was the federal government that was not Texas well that yeah but I mean we're the stewards of our values in Texas I mean the lieutenant governor is the steward of our values in Texas and the federal government comes along\nIn his tearing children away from their families you should have picked up the phone and called the president said look you've got to make the stop and we've got thirty eight electoral votes in Texas were not week we're strong damn Patrick did absolutely nothing and I'll say this to when President Trump issued an executive order saying we're not going to do this anymore I mean the ... cave to political pressure\nThe very first person to speak up was damn Patrick but he waited after the president\nDid the right thing not before and I thought that was just remarkable lack of leadership and cowardice back to securing the border uh\nWhen I go to the valley and talked to folks that live or not the ... valley bin ... Paso and he will pass in Del Rio unrest I spend a lot of time on the border you know you asked the folks who live there what do you think we gotta do to secure the border I mean they live it day in and day out\nAnd they'll come back and tell you that the right answer is technology and in better coordination of law enforcement\nAnd that we can do a much better job of securing the border doing those two things\nAnd still preserve a terrific relationship with all the good people in Mexico because it's essential to our economy's along the border that we have a good relationship with Mexico and the when you ask them how do they feel about the law they tell you it will not work\nAnd it will destroy that relationship so we must secure the border but we must do it intelligently and finally\nA what you saw Dan Patrick and the others in Texas do is throw it had eight hundred million or nine hundred million dollars at the problem but they wouldn't tell us how the money's being spent there was a zero accountability around those numbers and lo and behold four years later", "show_name": "Texas Matters", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "08"}
