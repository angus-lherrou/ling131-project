{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTDH", "content": "It is um well known at that early voting is a resource a means by which students and others who um can have opportunities devote outside of the traditional election day you know we all see the long lines that\nUm build on election day when we all are directed towards one day and you know ... a polling places\nAnd an early voting is meant to give people opportunities outside of traditional election day to vote\nOpportunities to vote when they have work schedules that don't allow them to stand in line for a long time that don't allow them to take off a lot of time to vote and students at prairie view is part of the activism that I mentioned was alarmed part of their um their their history\nThey've actually been pushing for early voting for years\nAnd they finally got it and I believe twenty sixteen\nAnd that was a that was a long hard fight fight just to get in early voting um poll polling box on their campus and want now that they've gotten it now they're asking for the ability to use it they're asking for opportunities to actually go to vote\nAnd that means having as ample opportunities to use that early voting site on campus as are provided to\nOther voters and other parts of the county who are given multiple days over the course of two weeks to go to the polls and those are parts of the county that have more resources where people have cars\nWhere people have maybe a because of the higher economics more flexible work\nUm ours are students on campus many of them do not have transportation including some of the individual plaintiffs they rely upon campus transportation to get back and forth I'm just school they rely upon friends' for rides to leave campus\nThe early voting site on campus is where people congregate where people use it's where they pass through day to day and they want that that early voting site to be up and running for as many days as possible um so that they can take advantage of the opportunity to vote\nLike every election years something happening up for review and him and Waller county and I remember you used to be the argument was that these were students\nThat they didn't really live in Waller county they were not real residents or many of them come from across Texas to across the country sometimes to go to this school and there were people in Waller county that felt like allowing these students to have the vote is unfair to the rest of the county\n... so that the Supreme Court has decided that issue and since then I\nThe vote is unfair to the rest of the county\n... so that the Supreme Court has decided that issue and since the Nineteen seventies has recognized that um you cannot treat student voters\nUm differently than other voters you cannot treat in particular black students voters differently than other voters it's well established that um students can register to vote in the places where they go to school and that is recognized by the Supreme Court and other courts and that is that is really\nI'm not where we are today and should not be the question I'm On the hearts and minds of elected officials or other members of the community these are students who for\nUm ... you know multiple the majority of the months out of the year if not all the time of the year live study work and contribute to that community and they certainly should have a say so over a ... their elected officials\nLooks like there have been some changes made to access to the\nPolls are prove UNM or they have said that they're going to open up a Sunday polling sites or the purview city hall and there were expand hours at the university campus center\nOn a Monday through Wednesday of next week from seven ... seven PM and sort of the original am to five PM\n... says the solution that you were looking for\nThis is a step um and we would say a modest step forward but it's not the solution that um we think would change things for this election cycle and for those that come after it um we\nCertainly think that the county should be providing early voting this week to the purview students on their campus and to provide even more early voting opportunities in the city of um prairie view the surrounding um city there are only a few more days before the first week of early voting is over but it's not too late\nThey could provide more ... on campus voting next week\nSo while there's on campus early voting Monday through Wednesday they could keep that voting machine on campus for Thursday and friday\nAnd they could provide even more early voting days in the city or purview next week\nBut what they could also do is make sure that that were not an exact same situation at the next election because\nLet it be known our clients and this and then the student body will be participating elections going forward and we'll expect equality and then an elections going forward and they will also be fighting for through this litigation and outside of that making sure that the process is\nBetter than what it has been that they are notified I'm In a in a meaningful way that these decisions are being made and that they are being invited to a conversation about proposals before they are adopted those would be the way to make sure that our litigation and the issues that the students have been working on it are resolved\nUm this is not simply about this two week election cycle this is about I'm a history and an ongoing ... ... reality of this county I'm not\nI'm providing a seat at the table sufficiently for the students at prairie view or for the surrounding community and those sort of structural systemic um changes to the process\nTo the notice to the transparency all of those have to be part of the conversation and part of the solution for us to really have moved the conversation forward and and and also a chief for our clients what they've been working for even before they hired us even before they started working for us\nThey were talking about these issues they were demanding these issues\nAnd what's unfortunate is that they have to get lawyers who\nIt started working for us they were talking about these issues they were demanding these issues and what's unfortunate is that they have to get lawyers who to to go to court\nBecause they're ... they're they're not getting the response from their people who say that they represent them I'm outside of the litigation process so that that those sort of systemic things or will be a way to actually resolve\nWhat our clients and others have long been fighting for all that campus and outside of it\n... restoration of the voting rights are something that would work\nThat would definitely help um we litigated that case up to the Supreme Court and defended\nThe process that was in place for over fifty years two or nearly fifty years that we would it would have required um this proposal have been scrutinized by by someone else including the federal government or a federal court\nIt would have not require potentially us to have done the lawsuit that that we have done it would have provided the community engagement process piece that we think is missing 'em through\nThe way that the commissioners are functioning\nThe the scrutiny that the voting rights I gave to places like Waller county that have shown themselves time and time again not just you know with this issue but in the two thousands this county prosecuted student voters and we're in an entered into a settlement ... multiple times related to their tax on student voters\nThey had been scrutinized and slapped\nBy the federal government and by federal courts and by the public time and time again and that was because we have the voting rights act fully functioning to help protect them and now we're now we're what we're left with is doing this sort of affirmative go into court after a decision has been made\nThat's the work that we've been doing but it's much more time consuming it's obviously costly\n... evidence the oh God yes because I Would persuade anyone who's looking at a law saying the voting rights are still ... is is it important\nAbsolutely so I think if you look at this this is a\nLocal relatively local issue in one county but it's part of\nUm of repeated pattern from the from from each decade you can look to Waller county provide evidence that racial discrimination is still running ramp it you can look to the states I'm decision to enact discriminatory photo ID law to have an an act intentionally discriminatory redistricting plans\nYou can look to what happened you know in another part of the state in Pasadena where they were found to be intentionally discriminatory for\nA redistricting dealing with their city council\nYou can look outside of Texas to what's happening in Georgia with the purging um of voters disproportionately black and brown you can look at what's happening with the challenge\nUm and ballot initiative to get people with felony convictions more than one point four million of them and the state of Florida\nYou can look all over the country um two ... evidence that a Justice Roberts and the other four members of the court got it absolutely wrong and twenty third team when they said things have changed so much in the south and we don't need the the the strong protections of the voting rights act\nTo address racial discrimination we're we've moved beyond um the tactics to did that did that suppress voting rights\nThis is what we're working on here and Waller county is ample evidence that that has is not true certainly in Waller county but you can look all across the country\nAnd and know that things are not where they need to be able to Justice Ginsberg said you know it's like throwing your umbrella out on a rainy day why throw away something that's protecting you and that's exactly um our our mentality our view of things which is we are",
