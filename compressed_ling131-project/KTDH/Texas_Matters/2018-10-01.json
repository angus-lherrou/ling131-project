{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTDH", "content": "Fort Sam Houston and the establishment of that military post army post here\nWas crucial for San Antonio stability and economic growth and development and creating it as a central location for the state of Texas I was the main quarter master posed at Fort Fort along the border and into west Texas before the run up to two World War one\nThe largest military presence\nIn the United states was along the U.S Mexico border and there was concern there about our relations with Mexico and whether or not it would become a hot war again Washington D. C. always saw San Antonio in Fort Sam Houston as a hedge against another war with Mexico and hostilities with Mexico\nWhich is interesting when we think about where we are today\nOh God yes I mean I think if you you imagine that border land stretching from Brownsville to what's now San Diego I'm and you think about San Antonio's role at least in the eastern part of that\nRegion and landscape um it has always been from a kind of us centered vision um the the that the place where you hold the line\nIt was true for Spain and Mexico in a different sense in a different sort of geography but but but nope where they built the largest base in San Antonio Fort Sam Houston know where the first airplanes went which we can\n... in that border land stretching from Brownsville to what's now San Diego I'm and you think about San Antonio's role at least in the eastern part of that\nRegion and landscape um it has always been from a kind of us centered vision um the the the the place where you hold the line\nIt was true for Spain and Mexico and a different sense in a different sort of geography but but but nope where they built the largest base in San Antonio Fort Sam Houston ... were the first airplanes went which we can say well let's climactic because San Antonio ... you know the ... the skies are clear true\nBut it could have gone to other places those first airplanes but they went to San Antonio and when the ... expedition head down to punish Mexico and punch of the uh uh where did they leave from San Antonio where did the national guard get trained\nSan Antonio before they went down and those airplanes followed suit the first airplanes used in sort of close support happened I'm there in in a way that that really priests aged what would happen in World War one that's where some of our military leadership and soldiers were first\nTrain for World War one was in this perjuring ... expedition that preceded that war so it's it's\nSan Antonio has been at the forefront of lots of different things in the other thing that I briefly talk about in the book um is that when the flood of Nineteen Twenty one happened that just tore apart San Antonio there's a whole section of this book that sort of follows floods and flooding\nAwful set Fort Sam Houston flew these airplanes and they took photographs of what happened there using cameras to Ariel serve veil 'em and assess the damage that then became part of the military strategy thereafter so even in peace time\nThe military in San Antonio was was was choosing the city as a way to think through its own strategic initiatives or that we would see in a flourish in the Nineteen thirties and obviously in World War two\nAside from the military richness of your military history point of view having all of that activity here and just one city because\nThere there was not a massive natural resource here to be mind or to create or to justify why is there a city in the middle of nowhere in Texas and why should it become an important\nLocation so the question is when you look back some cities are found it and they and they grow and they become a metropolis in some cities just fizzle out and they become nothing and they went out of existence and they fall off the map white is San Antonio become the city that it is\nAnd is this the result of um forces outside of its control or is is because of smart public policy you read the history that you write and ... and you say okay where were the forks and the road and which way which waited we'd go\nYeah that's a that's a great question and I hope we have an hour to answer it um but I think part of the way to think about this is that San Antonio served certain geopolitical needs\nUm for the Spanish first of all and for the Mexicans and ultimately the United states and it's always contingent that is to say that its relationship to other places depended upon where it was and so one could argue\nThat it is the only major city in the state with a possible exception of El Paso that actually has a geographical reason for being his in a watershed that was absolutely crucial for the Spanish or to build their missions and ultimately um to fashionable\nNeeds um for the Spanish first of all and for the Mexicans and ultimately the United states and it's always contingent that is to say that its relationship to other places depended upon where it was and so one could argue\nThat it is the only major city in the state with a possible exception of El Paso\nThat actually has a geographical reason for being his in a watershed that was absolutely crucial for the Spanish or to build their missions and ultimately um to fashion a life in South Texas Houston as it's called the bayou city for a recent\nLike New Orleans it's and it really precarious invulnerable spot and yet it has become the nation's fourth largest city Dallas has no reason for being an I'm Sorry for folks in Dallas but it's true um but was made\nTo be a city and San Antonio because of its environment and its provision ing hub uh\nPosture in effect that it was it supplied goods and services for the surrounding land ranch lands for example in agriculture um could limp along in a way through the nineteenth century without really doing very much in part because the U.S military was there because of its geopolitical\nImportance and that's why the military for more than a century and a half was vitally important in defining what San Antonio was but that meant\nThat the elite in San Antonio the power elite the commercial elite those who were making money off of the military and agriculture frankly they don't have to think\nLarge they don't have to imagine\nStuff because it's there for them were in Houston Dallas they had to be a hell of a lot more creative and so those cities got railroads before San Antonio\nOne sign of whether your entrepreneurial elite is willing to invest in the city's future with the fact that Saturday Tony oh every time a railroad possibly would come in before we got one and Eighteen Seventy seven I'm kind of\nSplit down the middle they weren't convinced it was a good idea for many of them um and you know that was not the case in Houston they had railroads before the civil war broke out that's not the case for Dallas um and so some of this is\nNature gave and we took some of this was the military provided and so we didn't have to think um and some of it is as you said earlier kind of missed opportunities um and not great public policy so you know it's not until after World War two\nThat that in my reading of the city's history that that\nAgain driven by military interests and the extraordinary amount of money that poured into San Antonio during World War two billions of dollars World War two ... uh Korea and Vietnam really poured in billions of dollars into the city that enabled the city to not only create\nThe middle class is just a specifically Latino middle class um but also to begin to imagine\nAnd this is crucial that you could really build this thing called the river walk and you could get tourists to come because it was a beautiful place and you could sell it that way um but it took awhile for that to unfold\nThis is Texas matters I was speaking with charm Miller author of San Antonio and try centennial history for the river walk was in an investment in San Antonio\nIt's crazy idea happen to work at the very initiation of the idea of plenty of people\nCalled it folly hemisphere sixty eight another crazy idea to just happen to work a lot of people all sort of like going this is now the idea but these are public investment ideas that paid off the city's highway system one of the first to have this inner collected a loop system\nThere's I was speaking with charm Miller author of San Antonio ... history of the river walk was in an investment in San Antonio\nIt's crazy idea happen to work at the very initiation of the idea of plenty of people\nCalled it folly hemisphere sixty eight another crazy idea to just happen to work a lot of people all sort of like going this is now the idea but these are public investment ideas that paid off the city's highway system one of the first to have\nThis inner collected a loop system and it just seemed like when you look back at like one of the hallmarks of a high marks for San Antonio's history and like this is really paid off it was\nPublic investment projects that worked\nYes yes and and public investment project up a certain kinds so it's actually the almost damn that's essential to the creation of the river walk unless you can control floodwaters blasting through the central core you can't really renovate\nThe river to the point at which a hug him in and others thought it could be done but it's not until the Nineteen fifties and really not until the Nineteen eighties when that river walk takes off but that's public investment that gave hotels incentives\nTo build there that you build the convention center that would feed those hotels in one way and those hotels would flush bodies onto the river walk itself and every restaurant and tourist shop becomes a cash register into which those tourist place their hard earned dollars I mean it's a it's a kind of\nFleece thing but that is what tourist towns do um but you also invest in rail\nYou invest in a ultimately unreal so there were four rail lines now coming into San Antonio you invest ultimately into the interstate highway system which is actually other people's money that's federal dollars that are coming in from the gas tax um but\nAnd this is where San Antonio's\nGenius was is that if the interstate highway system actually creates the loop for ten as we understand that today um and if you look at where the notes of that highway went they connect all of the bases so there's a way in which the national defense highway act\nThe interstate highway system act of the early ... of the middle fifties I'm really depended upon a previous public investment in the military presence that frankly opened up all the fat ranch land\nTo the suburbanization that would explode in the Nineteen sixties in Nineteen Seventy to eighty one comes in and helps funnel that to the north I'm thirty five comes in as well and suddenly you have a city", "show_name": "Texas Matters", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "01"}
