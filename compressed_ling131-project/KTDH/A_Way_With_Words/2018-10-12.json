R. G. O. U. way with words Hi Hi who's this\nThis is Barbara Murray and I'm calling from Curtis by the the California\nWell hello Barbara nice to talk to you Hi Barbara what's up\nHigh speed to talk to you guys to what can we do for you well um I have a question about a phrase that my\nMom always used and I never heard anyone else use it and it got to be kind of a family joke so now when we use it only use it like in a in a joking kind of way because we thought it was such a silly phrase\nSo she would always say whenever she thought we were going someplace like I grew up in northern California in the bay area so like when we had to go over to San Francisco and she knew it was going to be crowded and she would be like oh I really don't want to go it's going to be a mob scene\nAnd so that was her favorite she would always call things that she didn't even know for sure but anything she thought what's going to be crowded and she called it a mob scene and my kids pick it up and it just became a family joke so now when we talk about going anywhere were like oh God should we go it's got to be a mob\nSee why why not just because it's employed so often\nIt to me it always sounded like I didn't know where she got the phrase I never heard anyone else say it and it ... like it sounds vaguely sinister but the way she said it didn't really sound scary but I always picture\nLike the scene in the old Frankenstein movie where the the crowd is storming the castle\nWith flaming torches [laughter] pictures when she said mob scene so I just you know I wanted to know what was the real origin of the phrase due to other people use this did she make it up\nOh no it's been around for quite a while since since at least ah the late Eighteen hundreds mob scene and it referred to kind of the kind of seen that you're talking about just it comes from the world of theater and a whole bunch of people coming on stage you know they're big climactic crowd\nScenes yeah yeah grounded from all the\nTime how does the word mob makes it sound more horrible or bigger\n... has developed nuances over the centuries since it first really popped into the English language depending on context was sometimes mob behind you to be on medically implied violence or danger yeah\nYeah which which it was not in her case it was just me and she wasn't I Would not say that she wasn't any scientific sense agoraphobia she just didn't like to go any place that was crowded ... even though she constantly had to and so she would just always use that phrase and like I said now with the family joke\nI Love the word mob too because it comes from the Latin mobile a bogus which means the or the changeable\nCommon people the Hamas fickle common people in the mobile okay like mobile it's related to mobile and move\nIn her case it was just me and she wasn't I Would not say that she wasn't any scientific says agoraphobia she just didn't like to go any place that was crowded ... even though she constantly had to and so she would just always use that phrase and like I said now with the family joke\nI Love the word mob too because it comes from the Latin mobile a bogus which means the or the changeable\nCommon people the Hamas fickle common people in the mobile okay like mobile it's related to mobile and move and the vulgarity\nIs is like vulgar or but not vulnerable enough snow owners in common or ... yeah exactly say mostly yeah so the mobile a vogue us was was the uh the common people to the crowd that would uh seeing hose on one day in crucified I asked\nA lot isn't necessarily bad it's just a whole lot of people\nAnd disorganized ... will you never called soldiers on parade a mob because they're in writing when rose right\nRight they're very organized whereas a mob is just a bunch of people milling around right wing maybe\nPart of like my mother didn't like was just a whole ton of disorganized faithful\nAll right yeah I'm picturing all the extras in a in a movie scene or on your age you know saying peas and cares peas and carrots or whatever it is that they need to simulate crowd noise steamboat some that are [laughter]\nWell that's great I just you know as I said I have really never heard anyone else use it and I didn't know she had made it up or if it was the real thing and I just I Love that it's become a joke thing it's really one of those I rolling thing\nNow yeah only yeah so I think she would be happy to know or carry it on for her\nAnd now I'm going to think of her whenever I hear that term\nGet well my mom was a great person a great deal of Barbie thank you for your call we really appreciate it okay you have a great day Bye bye bye\nWe've talked about this on the show before how words that are no ordinary were once condemned is horrible oh yeah I was one of those words\nSo it earlier Seventeen ten Jonathan Swift and other people\nDescribed the word mob as terrible it was a shortened form of Latin phrase\nAnd he said it's the result of a natural tendency towards relapsing it's barbaric the which delights in Moscow syllables this criticism of shortening words which is perfectly ordinary way to make new words in English ... three hundred years old ... a long tradition a natural tendency towards relapsing and the bar verity\nAnd from Jackson Caroline Raymond proud sponsors the way we're into the nonprofit the producers and distributes this

Ohio which is about fifty miles outside of Cleveland she wrote to us\nI was very quiet girl shy and slightly backward but I was smart and in what was then called advanced classes my dad was in the military and we moved around a lot so I was really quiet and shy for that reason our home and family\nWas Mississippi she goes on to talk about how one day early in the school year her English teacher asked her a question and during the answered yes ma'am\nHer teacher was indignant and said you do not said ma'am to me it is disrespectful do you understand enter into automatically responded yes ma'am oh and she goes on to say remember I'm from Mississippi and in that day not saying that could get you a wooden spoon to the back side\nWe were born saying it before we said mama and daddy but the teacher saw it as smart alec in in her defense sometimes kids would say yes ma'am or something like that sarcastically anyway her teacher ended up sending to rent it to the principal's office and she goes on I had never been\nThere before I was embarrassed machines and mortified what had I\nDone my first year and I'm In trouble two weeks into being there the principal read the note listen to me talk\nAnd proceeded to tell me here in northeastern Ohio we speak standard English we do not slur our ours we do not stretch out our words we did not say\nCertain things they are not correct I was sent home with a note from him to have my parents sign it and come have a talk he made arrangements for me to have speech there once\nI was mortified\nFortunately though she writes my parents fell out laughing I never did do therapy I graduated with high honors from that school system after changing schools two more times in the four years I didn't think it funny at the time but I can look back over fifty years later and laugh oh\nI'm not you can live on that [laughter]\nI knew you would be not a no functioning not is not an urgent requires them requires better than I was gonna say the same thing I Am not to the funny stage yet there was [laughter] I Want to go to ... marching on her behalf the growing on me for her because she said yes man\nRight or and she speaks with the Mississippi accent yeah ... or hard\nOh I'm sure she's not the only person\nWith a story line ocean we get emails and calls about that yeah I\nGrew up speaking French in Maine and we're told the English speaking schools that they couldn't speak to people who have their hands smacked for speaking Spanish at the religious school mom because that's what the book at home but not at school yeah just finished reading about code talkers the Navajo and\nUm they were forced to go to the English speaking schools where\nFor her because she said yes man\nRight or and she speaks of the Mississippi accent yeah\nRight her heart oh I'm sure she's not the only person\nWith a story I Know she's not we get emails and calls about who\nGrew up speaking French in Maine and we're told the English speaking schools that they couldn't speak to people who had their hands smacked for speaking Spanish at a religious school them because that's what they spoke at home but not at school yeah I just finished reading about code talkers the Navajo and\nUm they were forced to go to the English speaking schools where they were spanked if they spoke Navajo to the whole thing attitudes are changing yeah they're into\nThanks for sharing that story yeah just to underline a dialect isn't a thing to be corrected it's a thing to be cherished well said eight seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three email words that we would radio dot org hello you have a way with words\nHi this is that ... I'm from Idaho and again I had a question about the ... language okay um I have a brother in law who bass and ah I don't I I had that kind of drug into the whole vast culture around guy to hell in Idaho has a very large task\nCommunity mhm and so um [noise] I find it pretty fascinating that language is I'm considered quite ancient uh is not related to any of the country is around ... am I in Spain and France So I Wonder what your cake was on it [noise]\nWell that's the best nutshell description I've heard of asking a while [laughter] pretty much it it's what's known as a language isolates do you know this expression\nYes I I look at yeah gotcha\nSo language ice lose one that does not connected directly to the languages around it and it is believed that bask predates\nThe Indo European languages that is it was a language spoken\nBefore the people who brought all the Indo European languages into Europe before they arrived and or a little bit about its history because there are few ah inscriptions on gravesites I'm of a lot of the place means give us clues to it\nBut the strong evidence is that it is not directly connected to any of the romance languages although it did borrow from Latin it's not connected to any of the Germanic languages other than maybe few words that have traveled\nFrom the dramatic languages into French and then in tobacco and things like that and so it's it's it's a very interesting thing it is about\nSouthern by about seven hundred thousand people give or take although almost all the speakers of bilingual and there are numerous dialects of it I think there's four major dialects of Basque\nAnd uh it's just a very interesting curiosity this remnants of another time and I'm not much is known about it and where it comes from although it's it's heavily studied because it's so interesting and so unconnected to the languages\nAround it is it clear that they felt it all say I heard that the people were somehow can stick with the ... maybe the Welsh his own I wished\nAre some people who've tried to\nPropose that theory but it doesn't withstand scrutiny some people have looked at genetic similarities between certain bodies of people\nUm and things I found something they were again generally it falls apart there are superficial similarities between all languages in the world\nAnd what you need is a consistent similarity across multiple features of the language for example where you would expect the verbs if one verb is similar between languages we expect many of the verbs to be similar between languages\nIf there's one word for say a relationship term like\nFather or mother rudest expect many other relationship terms to be the same and it's just not the case so\nI Believe the evidence is because there is no connection to well there is no\nSomething they were generally it falls apart there are superficial similarities between all languages in the world and what you need is a consistent similarity across multiple features of the language for example where you would expect the verbs if one verb is similar between languages we expect many of the verbs to be similar between languages\nIf there's one word for say a relationship term like ...\nFather or mother rudest expect many other relationship terms to be the same and it's just not the case so\nI Believe the evidence is because there is no connection to well ... there was no connection to the Celtic languages um it's not related to corners should not related to other languages spoken in France that aren't French and and so forth\nOh yeah it is a very interesting very interesting which ones and the bass people themselves I think are very interesting what their or and what isn't there a time to watch 'em and whoever was ruling in in Spain had bar people from speaking back yeah\nThat's a really common story across cultures it's not just the Spain but even in France some of their regional languages were stumped out by this French need for to establish a nation state with a French identity that was built upon the language and centered on French is the common language so by like spoken and Brittany are all but gone\nUm it's unfortunate but I'm having the United states as well and Canada and Australia and the China just happens pretty much anywhere where nations sees its identities being firmly attached to one language they almost always put in a program of stopping out the other languages\nFast food is really good and you have your relatives treated you to any\nOh yes they they have my sister has become quite the ask cooks really Boise has what they call a vast lock and they have a cultural ... but there are many bars and restaurants in the Boise area that are preserving that\nThe heritage foods as well so yeah it's pretty interesting\nYeah will Peggy thank you for telling us about all that we present your calling\nWell yeah well thank you for having me on the air and take care Bye bye Bye bye bye\nEight seven seven
