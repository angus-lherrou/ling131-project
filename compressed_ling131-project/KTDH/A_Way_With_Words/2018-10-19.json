nine to nine nine six seven three email words that we would radio dot org hello you're on the way with words\nAt my name is that's the way and I'm from Indianapolis, Indiana\nWelcome to the show how can we help you\nThe phrase that my grandmother used to use a she grew up in North Carolina and she would say crazy as a Betsy bug\nCrazy isn't bad see bugs [laughter] and now crazy that\nFast thing because it was never like if someone made her laugh she wouldn't say oh you know some people say oh you're so crazy or something like that she would never use it in that way it was if somebody was doing something that she thought was stupid\nOh man she was saying that part of it is crazy over this [laughter]\nAnd I I haven't heard it much um I spent some time and when I was a child in North Carolina I heard it there but as far as north I've not heard even from people who've come from the same region\nUh-huh and have you heard the term Betsy bug it all\nNow and I have no idea I Know I should I should look that up more but I have no idea what a Pepsi [laughter]\nWell we can tell what a Betsy bag is it's um it's a kind of beetle it also goes by the name patent leather beetle which kind of gives you an idea is is kind of as bad as big as your thumb and and\nBlack and shiny sometimes called the horned beetle but it's also called abet sea bug or a best bug or Bessie bug\nAnd um you see the phrase crazy is Betsy bug or different variations of that that throughout the south and nobody really knows why a ... might be considered crazy except it does make an interesting sand is kind of like you know when you disturb it it makes is kind of\nI don't really like a little like I had when you when it gets annoyed with you [laughter]\nKnow like that kind of a you know kind of a fuzzy you they're pretty sizable\nAnd I'm In this beautiful black patent leather looking thing\nI guess that's why it's crazy because other bugs don't talk to you\n[laughter] yeah you don't really see them swarming I'd only seen them you know just wandering around kind of [laughter] well maybe maybe you're right I read his thing [laughter]\nFrom where there were there ... and that's why I wanted that that's why I said it wasn't when she knew there was quite the opposite when she was just wonderful\nI always say I'm going to say to me I was really bloody recall ... spoke with us\nToday thank you so much I'm so happy lives spoken with both of you okay for work and I kept listening as well thanks a lot I but I personally hello\nYou have a way with words\nHello this is Joseph from will from Wyoming Joseph welcome to the show how can we help you I have a question about from par or under par when it's used as a Gulf term on her part or as a desirable thing from states that you want to find yourself in almost\nThe Gulf term on her part or as a desirable thing for states that you want to find yourself in almost every other endeavor that I can think of being under par or is not something you want to find yourself being\n[laughter] right right right All right so we can explain this there are two different\nScales here two different measuring scales and so what you need to remember is that each sport has its own way of considering something a really great score are really good score\nFor example if you got to sixty nine in golf that's usually pretty good if he got a sixteen and basketball people that are not a very good game you get a sixty nine of baseball people like started hearing\nYour [laughter] having to learn sitting right [laughter] following a story [laughter]\nAll right so we're talking about different measuring skills for each part of life not just sports and golf has this really interesting thing where they start with a an agreed upon number\nSo let's say sixty nine and you go a little bit above or a little bit below but that number is considered standard are par the number that up professional probably could reach on this course ... given sufficient time and expertise and\nAnd some experience on that course oh so golf is a scale that's low to high and so with low being better and so many other things most of the rest of the things in life\nAre the skill as high to low was hiding better and so it's just that court so we're still talking about part of being standard average or this this police that we're going to compare ourselves against it just it it's golf new low score and everything else almost you need a high score\nSo that's what you're saying the sub par that we use in everyday life actually doesn't come from golf it's just golf borrowed its power from regular English and the regular parties to standard usage of par were part of the number that you're going to try to beat and go above ... have been so it's a path Joseph thank you for your call we really appreciate it\nThank you Bye bye already have a\nLanguage has its court but sports always justice extra thing no more it's seems to go one more beyond ordinary in making the language its own for each individual sport\nNo effect ... followed by subhuman from cradle to grave and we'll bring it home with heart sounds doing ... you probably felt the punk rock songs row two and a half minutes long Mr specialist\nSo to bump into ... public radio this Saturday Night at midnight central [noise]\n[noise] throughout my entire adult life public radio has been a constant companion it's my go to source for news the shapes\nOur world and an emblem source of information in entertainment in many original and thought provoking shows it offers as a musician the inspiration I find in a diverse musical programs is priceless I'm Steve Johnson host and producer of open range in our\nLives company presents on high plains public radio and I'm proud to be a member supporter\nYou're listening to a way with words that show about language and how we use it I'm grant\nBeret and Martha Burnett when's the last time you really listen to silence\nI've been thinking about that ever since reading a passage from a book by Paul Goodman called speaking in language here's what he has to say about silence\nNot speaking in speaking are both human ways of being in the world and there are kinds in grades of each there's the dumb silence of slumber or apathy this sober silence that goes with the solemn animals face\nThe fragile silence of awareness past hearing the soul went to merge new thoughts the active silence of alert perception ready to say this this the musical silence that accompanies absorbed activity\nThe silence of listening to another speak catching the drift in helping him be clear\nThe noisy silence of resentment and self recrimination loud in sub vocal speech but cell in to say it baffled silence the silence of peaceful accord with other person's or communion with the cosmos\nAnd I was struck by that passage I just keep thinking about it because it really lays out lots of different kinds of silence mhm and when do we ever get to hear silence to begin with\nSilence much less noise right the silent right I don't think we do one of the things that I have read about in the last couple of years is the parts of speech that our silence\nWhere we think of language as being the talking part of the language is also the part where we stopped talking it's also the part where we leave space for ourselves or for others to pick up the thread or to continue the conversation that silence is just as important as the [noise]\nWhere we leave a space for ourselves or for others to pick up the thread or to continue the conversation that silence is just as important as the other end says\nMhm yeah when I Do improv it's you know one has a compulsion to keep talking but sometimes the most powerful moments are when you're completely quiet\nYeah that compulsion to keep talking is deal cop and journalists tricked right\nWhere you sit quiet for just a minute\nTo her or the interviewee is going to feel like they have to fill it in the rain thing that they shouldn't have said right the term for that in art is horror vaccine as a fear as as the vacuum you don't have to say that I appreciate science I'm a guy who wears earplugs when I work and when I sleep I like\nQuite a lot I mean a lot of money but I'm also the guy who on his podcast player app\nSets it to take the silence I guess\nIt can fit more and somebody listening you actually speed up the ... I don't anymore I used to do that because uh it's you have to\nGive it a hundred percent of your attention when it's a really fast right yeah I used to but now he's saying which helps quite a bit you can take for every ten hours I listen I can take out about an hour of science depending on the podcast wait you take out an automatic playing it's clear that automatically removed the\nSilence and people pause or there's a break between segments or\nThat sort of thing oh man I guess it depends on the topic what podcast you're listening to thoughtful podcast become friends can mimic unfortunately So Paul Goodman silence and his book speaking of language facts assignments that I really want\nThose are the moments that I really appreciate\nHow rear they are have is going to say even in a church should we think of as being assignment place there's still some of the air conditioning and the cars outside and the kids in Bible study right or even at a funeral or someplace like that there's music playing in the hallway and quite whispered conversations there is no real silent\nMhm yeah I guess that's what meditation is all about to write is letting those thoughts float through your mind\nWe'd love your thoughts on science is a part of communication and language he seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three email words it we were radio dot\nOrg hello you have a way with words Hi Hi this is\nA will calling from Lexington, Kentucky and I had a question about I'm washing machines and dishwashers\nYeah sure it will get the repair guys out and we'll get that sorted\n[laughter] ah actually is a bit of a more of a nomenclature question so before we moved into the the new house that we have here\nWe did not have one of the automatic dish washing machine we were just doing things by hand so I was calling it the washing machine for a while a which apparently is reserved for the call was washing machine so I was just curious\nAre two things one why does the clothes washing machine ... the official moniker a washing machine whereas the dishwasher\nHas the specific to it and why couldn't call the washing machine the clothes washing machine\n[laughter] right because it's it's usually uses a washer the washing machine and very rarely do you throw in the word closer laundry when you're talking about the device I think we can sort some of the south for you All right\nMore importantly to settle a bit of a disagreeing with my uh girlfriend here is it appropriate to call their clothes washing machine or is that\nNot allowed oh are you both from Kentucky\nOh no we're both from Ohio originally we've been in Kentucky about two months now so we haven't quite picked up the way they speak here but we both move around quite a bit like I had some time in Los Angeles she spent some time in Japan of all places\nOh let's let's set the second part aside for now more than I Do like to interfere with marriages as much as we can [laughter] for sure look kind of the linguistics\nFor now more than I Do like to interfere with marriages as much as we can [laughter] for sure what kind of a linguistics at first the first thing you've got to understand is that the machine the dish washing machine\nReplaced people who are already known as dishwashers so we called the dish washing machine the dishwasher\nBecause the people who used to the job are also known as dishwashers there's a clear like very long separation between the people dishwasher and the machine dishwasher\nAnd actually you can see this happened with the word computer we have this device on her desk now called the computer the people he used to do that kind of really complicated math were also noticed computer so this happens again and again an English where the machine that takes over the human job then gets to human name\nSo that's part of the reason why interesting yeah it's part of the reason why the dishwashers called the dishwasher\nThe other thing is that in washing machine that word washing referring to the task of cleaning clothes are doing the laundry is centuries old\nUh centuries older than any other kind of how ... form of any word related to washing like we have long needed to launder are close\nAnd we have called them the washing or the laundry for very long time so Washington mean washing clothes\nHas been ensconced in specialized afterwards and linguists use special like this one particular kind of washing since the fourteen hundreds so All right now because washing when you say\nI'm going to do the washing most people probably would assume that you were in the U.S anyway would seem that you were talking about the laundry in the u._k. they might actually think that you met the dishes which is really interesting\nThat you know this thing and I think the other thing that's going on here too is the dishwashers weren't part of the everyday household right in this country until the fifty right now and that washing machines where little or well the word washer meaning machine dishwasher dates to the Eighteen sixties right right but I mean in in somebody right\nEveryday use of it you know you had industrial dishwashers a rational dishwashers right so it really works on a kind of an order of events here which kind of use became more common sooner than the other ones that kind of takes the mantle as the definitive meaning for that word and you find that again and again in English where\nSomething kind of wins out and so for example in the U. S. football one out of the meaning for American football and in the world football one out meaning soccer\nAnd just they become the defendant ... football although there have for centuries been many other kinds of football but if you say football people in their mind they think of the one specific more common kind of ... who are you are\nFormer football soccer yeah\nSo have we preserved peace in your household I guess that's the bigger [laughter]\nUh I think so but um are you able to call it a cold water or is that the ...\nWell yeah you can but why\nIs it just to be that they're cut them is married to a small degree but I think the one who loves the laundry and presses\nThe button to call it whatever they said well you're doing a lot you know whenever you want them all she's doing much whatever she wants [laughter] that sounds fun All right take care of all and thanks for your call All right thank you I have a\nGood clean fun on this show eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three [noise]\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "A Way With Words", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "19"}
