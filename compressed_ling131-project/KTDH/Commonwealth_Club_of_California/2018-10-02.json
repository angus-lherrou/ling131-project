P. P. R. dot org and look under the support him for details [noise]\n\nWelcome to today's program of the commonwealth of California I'm Gloria ... the president and CEO of the club a nonpartisan non profit public forum dedicated to airing diverse views on important topics of the day some people think the world is moving too fast but former general\nElectric chair but come the only going to change faster Comstock who spent three decades he refers to her role as change maker she be ready for\nChange requires the courage to define conventions and the ability to know when to reinvent the way things are done business is she right we invited her to talk about her series with\nGina being cheated the founder and CEO of mine this program was made possible by support from Wells Fargo knowledge to invest Comstock Gina Bianchi conversation at the ... [noise]\n\nHey\nMy name is Gina being ... I Am the founder and CEO of a start up here in Silicon valley called mighty networks but tonight I Am just\nAn interest in Seoul\nHere in Silicon valley called mighty networks but tonight I Am just an interest in Seoul who was excited to be in conversation and thrilled to be in conversation with UPS happy to come back I think about you as a business rocks her business rockstar wow that's a tall\nLadder don't hang out in reading this book\nI think the much more appropriate term which I just found so inspiring is as a change agent a change maker how do you define what it means to be a change maker and when did you know you were one\nYeah well I didn't I didn't grow aspire to be one when I was growing up that's for sure I to me change maker is I'm just somebody who just has a passion to discover what's new and what's next\nAnd you believe in a better way and you're going to make it happen it's also a very entrepreneurial kind of trade right to believe in a better way and you're going to do whatever you can to make it happen\nSo I think there's a there's a part of an entrepreneur that's a change maker and when did you know you were one I think just as I kept finding myself in these positions where I wanted to be part of something better and different uh I'd say my big epiphany came at one of the most formative jobs I ever had when I worked at NBC News\nKind of the second time and it was right after NBC had had a big crisis uh the original fake news episode in the nineties where uh the news was actually brought to its knees everyone got fired and I was brought in as part of a new team and it was the most entrepreneurial assignment I had had\nWe had nothing to lose because everything has almost been law said almost shut the news division down and so we were encouraged we what what was the incident the incident was um there was a dateline episode where they faked\nI'm a General Motors car blowing up a effected by putting a rockets on the truck and blow it up for a fact talk about entrepreneur it yeah it was very entrepreneurial and it basically got out almost every one fired\nHow and so when you're in that position where you have nothing to lose you become very creative you become like you bring this\nTeam together and so for me it was an incredible awakening that uh I could be part of change that I could be valued for an opinion that could form a team around it it was just freeing and to this day probably one of the best jobs I ever had so that was very early in my career I Would have probably been um you know early to mid thirties\nWow and so you know one of the things that was really striking to me in reading the book which it's awesome and I actually I found super inspiring to really sort of think about\nWhat does what does it mean to be an explorer or a change maker as an individual as a leader of an organization and then also as an advisor you've played all three of the different\nDifferent roles you know ... one of the things in your story that is super interesting is the fact that you know you have found yourself sort of time and time again being asked by someone to take on more responsibility to take on a big challenge and you haven't backed down from it\nAnd that's what I was curious one was kind of the moment that you knew you were not only capable but but excited\nFor the thrill and the challenge of taking on something that didn't\nSeem like it was possible because what you're describing in terms of NBC News was before you went to ... for the time and they're not going to share that story\nWell I um I grew up in NBC GE owns NBC\nI got a call one day from jak well saying hey come upstairs I Want to talk to you and he brought me energy and it was it was the height of ... g's ascension to you know rock star status as a company and him as rock star CEO\nAnd it was a time of he was in the process of having a succession he had announced that um but the culture was very much of perfection and precision\nAnd it was a time of he was in the process of having a succession he had announced that um but the culture was very much of perfection and precision and um it was very much six sigma had rocketed did use that to you know kind of help the company at NBC we did six sigma and like we didn't know what we were doing it was\nIt was like imagine I mean six sigma in a broadcasting network I don't know we the best we came up with rebranded these hats that were really great we called him cue NBC was quality NBC\nAnd um my first exposure to six sigma is actually the thirty rocket you know it's a it's a bad ...\nIt's the best but people thought we were launching um the queer network where in DC and they became incredibly hot hat because people thought they were really really we're launching something really exciting and it wasn't that exciting but um so I go to the G and it was very much this precision\nCulture and so jak leaves Jeff ... comes in and I think I was tasked\nWith at the time I became chief marketing officer and just we had to innovate and it was really hard to innovate in a culture that was all about perfection and trust\nMe like when you're flying a jet engine wherever you're going next time like what what like\nSignal you want that to be as many signals as possible but if you're going to innovate I'm a quest for perfection ... hold your background so people ground measuring defects and if you made a mistake you were a defect that was the environment I walked into what I\nFound reading the book that was so cool is there was a very specific reason that G. E.\nWas moving from the the six sigma financial operations and engineering and manufacturing excellence to innovation and exploration which was this move from you know essentially manufactured growth to organic rose what was that like to go through the transition\nOf a corporate strategy and just what was that experience like and then there's also a really interesting aspect which was\nNot only were you entering an organization that had three hundred thousand employees and was moving to a very ... needed to move to a very different culture in a very different metric which was organic rose but you're also doing it in a role that you would never had before\nYeah so I mean the organic meant it was clear of the company had grown a lot through acquisition and I think that happens a lot in business where you grow through acquisition but you need to grow it you have and the world was becoming more global and\nGrow the opportunity to grow meant you had to go to new markets or you had to discover all kinds of new trends you had to to be part of the world and that was the mandate right and so I came in as the chief marketing officer you hadn't been one I hadn't been one I haven't even been like a marketing spin and NBC\nI had led advertising edgy\nBut marketing and advertising advertisers just a small town of marketing and the sort of to me the opportunity was marketing is about the market like this is it it's about gross it's about making the market it's about and when when you take your job seriously it's about marketing live in the market you start to see change you start to see patterns\nAnd so that really became I think the discovery for us was hey marketing should be brought to the beginning of the process\nIt's the GPS of an organization it's where's the world's going and that was really are calling card\nSo moving from it and that was that the expectation of G. E. your peers and not not at all\nAnd they also expect a nation that we he wanted he wanted a team that could help help us point to where the world was going and to help drive new revenue that was organic growth\nNew revenue and he just kind of said here go figure it out and I hadn't been trained classically I hadn't been to business school I grew up in media and so I had to kind of forge a new path people like why are you here they didn't\nBeen trained classically I hadn't been to business school I grew up in media and so I had to kind of forge a new path people like why are you here\nThey didn't want to know what they didn't really even understand what marketing was\nNor did I really um but the sense of it's not just what you tell the story you tell it's not just the ads you do [noise] um so we went out and hired a bunch of great marketing people um I heard a bunch of MBAs which we can come back to I\nI think that they were helpful they brought their tool kit but they were not as entrepreneurial and figure it out kind of people as we ultimately needed um but it was really just let's get people in let's just go to the markets and see what's happening and that was the journey that we went on\nThis new weird thing and you make the team feel really uncomfortable um because they provoke them I remember in the early days of\nBlocked a I we've got some folks here her experts in block chain in bitcoin 'em and bringing in some of the real early pioneers many of them from here into our financial services teen\nAnd forcing them over dinner for three hours to have really uncomfortable conversations people talking about things they had no idea what they were talking about [noise] um but usually out of that they're like oh a and you're you're there translating in facilitating you see if this happens okay\nBut usually out of that they're like oh a and you're you're there translating in facilitating you see\nIf this happens okay maybe it's not the crypto currency we care about but what about a hyper ledger what about the ability to have a totally transparent ledger what will that due to the accounting systems of our company so your job is a bit of a ... in that role the outside\nOr inside as a translator almost like a midwife you're kind of trying to bring along that process\nUm but people have to see it for themselves\nAnd I think that's where companies organizations fall down yes you need a big believer in future is\nAnd consultants and people like that but what happens if you're if you're not careful as you're a bit of a like a cool kid trendy smarty pants and people like shut off I I don't know what you're talking about they have to see\nIt for themselves they have to make room for it in their own way so that is a lot of those kind of group exercises the field trips you're doing together is that people have to make their sense of these that these new trends\nAnd how have you done that\nIt is specially in establish organizations\nYou know the innovators dilemma and you know the ... you know that that the analog dollars in digital pennies um as as an example from the digital advertising Ira is that is just such a great example of you know\nEverybody actually has a point of view that's accurate yet um yes\nIt is less money today but how do you refrain people's perspectives especially people that you are influencing as piers around and people that don't report to you that are more senior to you what have you found works because it seems like harnessing\nThat kind of you know lightning in a bottle is something that each and every one of us can take into work tomorrow\nYeah well I um I think what doesn't work has to come in and go like yours as you you don't get it do you uh which I've been incredibly guilty of doing in my career and you talk about the digital pennies for the digital pennies versus analog dollars that\nWas a big thing when I was at NBC and where the arrival of sort of take you back to that time um it was the arrival of YouTube on the scene and if you were in media at the time you were equally equal parts bemused and horrified you were bemused because it was like oh so cute these cats playing piano is and that's\nSo cute that's really clever and then you were panic 'cause you're like well what if everybody likes cats playing piano and they don't want what we make anymore what are we going to do um so the first\nThing you do is you try to bring in people who are good at doing videos of cats playing the piano [noise] um and we did that right I mean we tried to bring in people early pioneers who did kind of short videos trying to embed them in this case working even in places like\nSaturday Night live in places like that where you're trying to embed\nSome of that are taking the examples that are happening and and blowing them up in that case a Saturday Night live had a big hit with something called um called I'm lazy Monday lazy Monday and it was ... lazy Sunday sorry and it became a ... create all these fire hits\nOn lazy Monday and other things but late Sunday was you know this huge a kind of broke the Internet of its day and I'm like oh that's good like we can do that and let's bring in more people like that and so you salute the people inside who were doing that they become your heroes and you find a way to fund more of that and you said be like be like them\nUm so it's just a continual seeding of that environment um the worst thing you can do is just say okay this is a new thing now everybody change and this is it because people don't want don't want to do that\nOr allow for an organization and this certainly happened during you know that the dot com bust where it was like everybody who was in traditional media breathe a sigh of relief because this whole Internet thing was not actually\nYou know that the dot com bust where it was like everybody who is in traditional media breathed a sigh of relief because this whole Internet thing was not actually going to happen yeah ah\nAnd you have to keep pushing it you have to keep pushing it and there are a lot of failures there are a lot of things that don't work we did a big acquisitions at the time we did a big acquisition called ... village that was this amazing community and it was a perfect strategy was community meets\nContent and you know in in our mind we didn't we didn't have enough foresight to think this is an ex Facebook Facebook was just arriving on the scene but you saw the pieces there but we totally botched it up we put all the big company sort of east coast you killed at you rejected the you we we picked a property that probably wasn't you know it wasn't as savvy\nIt technically is it needed to be and then the organization just kills it so that's a lot of what you have to be prepared to do is you're getting ready for these new things\nAnd so you have to be patient if you're willing to put some dollars at work on things that aren't going to work out and you have to keep doing it now a decade later you look back and you say those things were going to happen but you often don't have a decade to say she told you so well\nAnd and what's so amazing about your career is you know that\nFor every ... village there's a Hulu yet and we're every um you know for for every\nFailure there's a ... imagination you know and and these types of things that really not only delivered and this is\nThis is where I think the innovation that you\nReally spearheaded and organized and collaborated and really shifted culture edgy is so impressive because you did it\nYes there was investment that but there was absolutely the expectation that there was it was about like eagle imagination was about the environment but also about economic dad are going to make some money and\nAnd maybe you can share a little bit about that story because it's it coming back to what we were talking about earlier of this cultural shift and uh a trench shift what you did with that um and what the leadership team and gee did with ... is is pretty incredible\nWell it's a similar kind of what you're seeing a pattern hears I'm Talking I mean at the time we were hearing from our customers that they were uh in different industries air train energy that they were\nSeeing regulation in Europe they were fearful that they were gonna have a financial hardship of regulation came here and they weren't ready for it and they said what can you do you start to see the pattern recognition\nTeam goes to work let's go discover let's go in the market let's figure out what the trends are saying um and it was again back to like cats playing piano is very silly a central generation energy business\nOh you know wind is cute it's cute the energy from the\nSun yeah that that's cute like that's really cute but um we we we and ... so you have to get out and discover you have to have a champion we had a champion and Jeff ... CEO and chairman a GED who who championed the discovery of those who made room for that you have to have that\nYou have to have time to see the patterns and I say one of the best things that ... that I learned out of that is you have to take some of those naysayers the\nThe um stakeholders that are building that future and you have to dream together um so what often holds companies back is it's like well my customers will never go for that so ugly ... green tech okay some customers want it but we got a lot of customers\nThat are never going to go for that so what we created we're dreaming sessions with customers where we came we brought top costs energy customers brought them together we dreamed we said we're going to dream about ten years we gave them virtual currency and it wasn't crypto currency\nBut it was you know okay here's a million dollars what are you going to spend it on and we literally imagined it forward what's the future look like if you're investing our money with us what technology\nAnd spend it on and we literally imagined it forward what's the future look like if you're investing our money with us what technology out of that came a much more enhanced position and wind but you did it together and the sales\nTeam that was very nervous like we're going to get ahead of our customers to finance team oh no we are going to get ahead of the market started to see like our customers will sign up for this\nThey're buying and for this so you're getting over the fear that is what you're doing and you're creating a shared vision for the future and a story together and those things\nAnd then you have to go to work and so an ego we said okay we're going to invest money we're going to hold ourselves accountable we're going to talk to a lot of people in the I'm In a clean space who previously criticized us 'cause we had a pretty harsh we fought the EPA on some things that we had to really put ourselves out there take risks\nTo all the time you're working through this situation where ultimately the bottom line is people are afraid\nThey're afraid of taking a risk they're afraid of change they're afraid of losing business\nAnd this interesting sort of footnote to the ego effort is um we were all we were talking to customers who were planning the future other customers were like I don't want anything to do with us and we did lose one customer to the tune of at least a hundred million dollars and you have to have that moment ... ... he didn't tell us the\nTeam that was developing it which I really appreciate it\nSo you have to protect those nascent teens and make sure they're not losing confidence and that they keep pushing forward and that you have enough good insight that you're on the right path well\nAnd I I Love that story because it really does speak to what it means to be a leader yes it does is sometimes you have to actually take it and it's not about spreading you know spreading fear\nBut rather you actually containing it and and that's also why I asked the question around how do you take care of yourself as a leader\nUm and ensure that you actually have the resilience and the things that you need to push forward to that ten year vision and to that future that can have a number of different possibilities\nWithout a tie but um and so we all like Jack Dorsey yeah yeah so we tend to find in front of Congress yeah it is awkward right and so we've we've put a pilot project together we threw him and we said we're going to put a project together you're in and he was able to sort of in a pretty short time show and integrated team\nAt the beginning he comes in I remember they were sitting like this they're like OK smarty pants you know software guy what do you know you talk about ... a change order you can make fifty change orders in ... in a week we we can't make one order change in a year where do you know and he showed them what he knew when he challenged the\nThinking and he brought them in and you know what what we learned it was a it was the fear that was holding people back and it gave birth to something we called fast works and lean start up with just a piece of it but it was really this test\nAnd learn minimally viable product became a really great way to get change going okay it just just test it just give me a prototype and again software people and you know think that's\nThe way you work but not every not every organization is used to doing that\nI think that is a a really important point at one of our audience members asked when you're on a show you said what was sort of the most surprisingly innovative company out there and you said Walmart\nUm why well I I'll get some contacts\nI think in terms of uh they they said you can't pick any new tech company okay so\nThat as a bit of ... of qualifier I'm and I'm just because I worked for the company I'm into transformation stories I like it's easy to be disruptive when you start from scratch and you don't have legacy issues to deal with it's easy to be innovative it's not easy to be innovative in any situation on economic refrain that\nIt is really hard to transform when you've been around for a while and when you have big scale\nAnd look they've had a few missteps right they haven't gotten the digital thing\nRight seemingly now they either with fear patients whatever they've started to play to their strengths they acquired jet realizing they had to be digital and they've started to accept\nAnd recognize their need for their physical locations in a way that I think is pretty smart and so I like some of these traditional companies and I guess I Would especially sitting here in Silicon valley\nYou've got Google down the road you've got apple down the road you've got you know Amazon above plane ride away on this coast these are big ... these are becoming big companies\nThat um are at a huge scale with huge expectations about what they're going to do next are they going to be able to reinvent what's next are they taking enough meaningful risks\nAre we asking those questions now and are we looking to some of these older companies that have had to go through this look at Tesla right down the road right now\nThose questions now and are we looking to some of these older companies\nThat have had to go through this look at Tesla right down the road right now there's a lot of challenges at Tesla I we could probably have a whole lecture on tests on I'm not an expert but I think one of one of their issues is scale and so\nAre they learning from what GM has done yes we want to dismiss GM and say oh they're yesterday there the horse and buggy\nBut there are some good things they've done so how crazy would it be for the Tesla team to and they are hiring those kinds of people to say huh\nTesla might have a cultural issue are they looking at more established companies that have really invested in the people in the culture and getting them to transform at scale as these companies here get to these places they need those kind of role models which maybe they're not thinking they they it\nIt's interesting from a cultural perspective because if you think about you know raising a pirate flag outside of your company and rallying a really small team to be better than those stupid people over in Detroit or the stupid people up in Seattle or\nYou know the stupid people in New York because we're smarter better at and doing something and that is actually if if if you've built a company or a product that achieves\nGrowth in scale doing that and not GE scale but like San Francisco stale like that's different scale it when you make that transformation and how you make that transition actually becomes pretty challenging\nIt does and you have to keep renewing yourself and you still need those pirates with in it\nAnd that even test jobs finally took some Microsoft Money yeah you and but it's a fine balance if you're leading these scaled\nCompanies that you need both you need the people who can help you the the sort of precision operations and you need to constantly received the pirates and I think you look at these big companies I mean jeeze a classic case it's it's been a tough place right now it's a really great company but you know you could say\nCouldn't move faster the complexity of that company I don't think people outside for sure and even inside appreciated the complexity that came with all that scale and how hard it is to re boot\nAs you reflect back\nOn your nearly Thirty years at at GE or at NBC Angie [noise] you know are there moments are there are there inflection points that as you fast forward a decade to today where you know the the the complexity and the challenges are actually a little bit overwhelming story you how do you\nThink about it um what's ... what's your sort of assessment and also just what's one practical thing that as you look back on any of us\nListening to this tonight or in the audience\nCan kind of take away as we think about the story of gee\nI I think that um you don't get to be a hundred and twenty five year old company without knowing how to transform yourself so they're always highs and lows and they're always going to be that and you always have to there has to be\nSome part of the company that believes tomorrow's going to be better than ... than today and so are you making room for that and I can point to show you right now if I were to take you to even del Ohio where they're creating the\nFuture of aviation and manufacturing they there are three D printing and metal and creating a whole new way of working\nThat future exists there you have to believe that and you have to see\nIt and so I think you have to have some patients I worry a little bit about our short term ism and are you know ... where we are in the in the financial markets right now I'm it'd be easy to Justin blame investors they they return they ... they deserve a return but um I Do think our lack of impatience and\nSomewhat imagination for the future ... some of that and so what's my lesson is that you constantly have to move the speed of the market\nOr lack of impatience and somewhat imagination for the future Stein me some of that and so what's my lesson is that you constantly have to move the speed of the market you can't get complacent your culture needs to feel energized and a bit of fear at the\nSame time and you need those rebel pirates always within always within and you just can't become such a perfection machine\nThat you that you ignore the rebel pirates that you need with and\nIs it easier you know does the does the precision machine end up having more resilience than the rebel pirates and they said both ... ... you need both but which ones are easier to or is it just basically time\nI think it's basically time okay I think it's basically time because you have to believe those rebel pirates are going to get you to the next level and then you have a team that knows how to get to scale and operate at scale right so you kind of need both and we dismiss\nThose people who are good seeding um things\nUm what's the trajectory hears every are is your future as a start up founder is your future um ... played out what what are the scenarios for you in the future you\nYou scale you go public you get acquired or you just keep sustaining\nSome level right\nAnd so are we go out of business do you go out of business right not happening tomorrow so that yeah but the the traditional thinking is you're either going to go public where you're going to get acquired yes and then once you get it either of those scenarios you get big and how are you going\nTo start again you get acquired and you're going to leave because you want to start something all over again and not want to start something I'll ever since I've had that shouldn't be that hard for people like you yes and yet that seems pretty\nDismal and and this is relevant to to a question for you it's not the first step is companies to not have that regeneration machine\nDo well and and that's actually one of the really interesting questions that that is from an audience member but apparently also super relevant to me at this point um which is you know in a large company where there is a lot of\nWays in which you are protecting the organizational resiliency for the status quo super high\nIf you were living in in in an innovation center or a nascent project that loses its executive sponsor\nOr you know the person who does the acquisition who then leaves or buys your product that then leaves how do you think about if you are on that team today as it looks like one of our audience members might be um you know how do you think about\nThe things that that team can do\nTo preserve itself and also have the footprint a and potential to really sort of show something forward you may be it's going to find a different executives\nIt is that's what you have to do because I think the chances are pretty good if you go into if you get a choir to go into a company thinking I I'm good 'cause I got this champion they're going to be there they're not going to be there so I think you have to so it's a lot of just building\nYour building influence your building bigger organizations I think it's the same if you're running the city of San Francisco you're in the governor's office\nI mean organizations you need to have influence skills\nSo you're constantly having to be out there and finding new people to join you were kind of Mary band of of people who are trying to create a different way and\nThey're getting benefits and you're working on projects that they care about and you're trying to understand the problem is they're trying to solve that is what you have to do you cannot just
