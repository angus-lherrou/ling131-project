did that happen\nAnd kid can you give us just a brief look at the journey of April Ryan to the role of White House reporter\n[noise] um my journey as nontraditional\nTo say the least I Am a product of two people who came from agrarian families I'm a mother from South Sudan North Carolina forgive me lord because they had\nA [noise] a North Carolina and my father from Maryland and in\nNineteen sixty seven I was born to two people who just wanted to to build a family together it was the first order of of that union and I was very precocious 'em to say the least it took them seven years to have my brother so\n[laughter] but um you know I grew up in a household where you remember this you know that's\nTo have my brother so [laughter] but um you know I grew up in a household where you\nRemember this you know that's the way it was my father and mother watched Walter Cronkite you know religiously\nAnd my mother she was ahead of her time she was an activist um she was on a college campus she toilet at Morgan State university for forty two and a half years until her death and I'm a\n... baby so [noise] um she believed in people and she believed in advancing causes and I didn't I don't know I guess I picked it up [laughter] I didn't think I did but sometimes when you're in a setting it comes and just\nSits on you and it said on me so\nWith my dad I'm In the evenings he would come home from work and he would sit down and watch Walter Cronkite like dad we listen to the local radio local news and I'm like\nWhy you always watching the news I mean with so much of a big thing in my home to watch the news but those three stations at the time um remember that\nAnd the and the white noise after Johnny Carson will go off and you know you know and the flab would come up with five AM I mean I'm Talking about that time so [laughter] um my dad\nWas watching news so much a step why are you watching the news all the time and and and I should have as a child run from the news when he said this but I just ran two weeks I said that while you're watching as you said because I Want to know when the world comes to an end I'm like oh my gosh\nYou know that it may have wanted to find out about this [noise] so um\nAnd I believe I mean I I Believe now that I look back and\nThat's where the foundation was late for me\nUm my mother was always into current events and she she knew what was happening um you know I always knew about my history I was a kid you know you sit at the kitchen table and you have a peanut do you know how many uses there are\nA peanut unload all mama George Washington Carver if we talk about blood Charles true\nAnd if you don't know about it and Google it's my mother used to tell me look it up you know when we had dictionaries without the Internet Google Charles through you'd be surprised and fascinated [noise]\nUm you know and it would stop at a stop light you know a black man made the stop okay mama you\nKnow [laughter] and a gas masks I mean she's\nMy mother always taught me about excellence in our community I always knew was going on because we listen to the news and I don't know I just I grew up understanding life but I was never socially aware you know went through college I was a DJ in school\nFor as DJ ... where you go I was pretty good [noise] Hi this is April Ryan W\nE a a\nDon't know but you know it's like after a while I Can't you know I needed more I didn't tie into but I don't have anything else to talk about other than just a sharp de cry you know I was like I said anymore but I had a burning\nNews I wanted to get more information so I started I'm venturing into producing a new show and I started into doing news um I remember my last DJ gig was at\nThe station in Baltimore we used to be owned by James Brown yes James Brown and then it was owned by Dorothy bronze in the late Dorothy Brunson\nAnd I remember as this is not for me and I I had a yearning I didn't realize it for information that's where it started school my sophomore year started a really getting into news so you finished college finished and then what um I was working for gospel radio station um\nThat are really getting into news so you finished college finish and then what um I was working for gospel radio station I'm well while I was in school I was working at various radio stations and my checks were balancing but I was getting the\nThe the payroll checks were bouncing [laughter] and I was but I was getting experience and I worked at a a gospel radio station and I was telemarketing at the same time my father never forget\n\nUsed to come home after school walking home and my little Catholic school uniform I was one of those bad Catholic school girls [noise] and uh [laughter] Southern Baptists below Catholic school girl [laughter] I Would walk home and go home and I I'm I'm One of those weird kids I Would I wasn't supposed to go out\nAnd to my parents got home stayed in the house but I you know what I Would do I go to that component set that looked like a coughing not the components to lose a stereotype was remember those old soon it looked like a coffee slacks\nWhat I Would do I go to that component set that looked like a cough and not the components that loses stereotypes remember those old soon it looked like a cough and slides\nA fan [laughter] I wouldn't go through my mother's\nForty five years and and and thirty three and Seventy five and put on the record Dr King is I have a dream speech is I've been to the mountaintop speech I was a kid who was that was weird\nI should have been watching something else on TV or doing homework I was listening to Dr King and reading is because I mean I felt it as a child\nSo she meant a lot to me so I Am there that day I'm trying to figure out am I going to ask the question should I shouldn't I and I didn't make the determination until I delivered it that I was going to ... wait on me so much and then after I asked\nThe question twice in the ass Mr President you want to answer any question he didn't answer and I mean I felt the weight of the moment I felt the weight of what I done I felt the wave of my history I felt ashamed because I'm are Dr King's\nDay because the president was there with Dr King's\nNiece and nephew not the children\nAnd black Republicans to celebrate this\n[noise] this man this this dream or who's now he was a march or who's now marred to celebrate\nThe fact that they were expanding the land around the king center and here I come messing it up that still bothers ...\nDo you regret and all the question why not I called MLK Martin Luther king the third and asked him I ... I Want to apologize to you you said for what I said because I asked he said no no no no you did the right thing and it still\nBothers me because again you should never have to ask a sitting US President if he's a racist and then on that day and I didn't realize how big the question was\nEight landed at ... I did not know I made it a point to pull myself away from TV 'cause I was so upset and I just live my life and because it it not only that I mean I had ... a\nPastor Darrell Scott ... he was going to throw water on me you're right about that and yeah in that room after I asked the question and other reporters were around yeah\nSo let me ask you this though I'm I'm going to read from your book and this is after the question is that as a reporter you're right I have been lied about and talked about all with an effort to discredit me I've been harshly criticized by some and applauded\nBy others and then a little further in the book you write it's the job I Love\nI Do love his job [laughter]\nHow do you love a job where you are seemingly you have become the story\nAs I get emotional right now talking about that and I and it still bothers me and I didn't realize you know sometimes you don't face\nWhen you face it you feel it but I this is what I studied for this is my ... I didn't know all this other stuff was going to happen but I I Love this job and I'm not gonna let anyone\nCan out my dream my mother and father's dream for me my community strain and those shoulders that I stand on I Will not I love this job because I'm asking a question I gotta say no no no I'm not going anywhere I Love my job [noise]\nI Do\nHave to tell you all that when April comes on and she's on CNN for example since we see that she can she honest start yelling at ...\nBut it didn't watch it if you if you do so\nShe's on CNN for example since we see that she she honest start yelling at ...\nBut it didn't watch it to us you know I was born [laughter] let it\nGo to a a lighter subject such um have you read almost is no on\n[noise] on hand have mama why'd you know and I will not\nAnd why is that lord have mercy\n[laughter]\nAnd your book you write about your interactions with almost well let's talk about ... my interact already interactions with on Rosa alma Rosa\nIs the reason why all of this stuff happened she started it even though she's fired the residue still is there huh I'm a Rosen\nI and I and I I don't touch on it I don't the book is\nNot about her right [noise] I don't have a tape\n[noise] and I still I'm a best seller [laughter]\n[noise]\nSo forgive me but I'm a rose and our friends we were close I Love to like a sister while everybody was telling the girl she don't cut your throat I'm like no no no I don't know\nThat's that's just the TV [noise] little did I Know\nUm she hurt me and we we're backstage and it today and it's crazy today I was looking you know when you're on a plane five point five hour flight and you use [laughter]\nI'm trying to figure out you know okay what's going on what I Do you know looking through my phone and I look at my picture so and I go back in time today was the first day I went back in time my pictures with her and I bought a ... we were close and I showed you some of the pictures\nAre families knew each other [noise] I went to our church she took me to Skid Row wishy minister and then this person who is this\nI'm like so in my take your final issued getting her way so you get in her way apparently it's sad we can leave it at that if you know I'll I'll talk about it I think as far to [laughter]\nGet it out and brief um no so what happened was um\nWe were friends but that friendship I mean she's she was in it is not a ... not conjecture\nShe worked for Bill Clinton um she was an Al Gore's office when Al Gore wanted me to interview enemy would tell her to call me and that's how we started and back then you know we were both young you know Twenty years I was was it Twenty one I'm fifty one now whatever job to the masses are still young now thank you [laughter]\nSo um you\nKnow we became friendly and then after she left I got fired or moved up failed up or whatever the White House\nYou know we'd run into each other it's the truth we'd run into each other around the country and you know she'd be somewhere and I'd be someone like hey let's let's you know get together and we got closer much closer over the years and um\nBut then a long story short when she became a part of the Trump campaign\nI became a target the president did not like the press oh got someone close oh I've got a dean of the press corps\nOh I can get her and make them think that I Am and this can make them except me [noise] as with a friend will do so she I was in ... leaks\nAnd I'm I'm not mad I don't care they can talk about ... I think it's a badge of honor that I'm In with the lakes and the reason why I say that is because any reporter in Washington works\nMad I don't care they can talk about ... I think it's a badge of honor that I'm In the lakes and the reason why I say that is because any reporter in Washington worth their penance pad their microphone and\nVideo camera [noise] should have been ... and I say that because John Podesta I've known him for a long time and\nI was asking John Podesta why is emailed him why is it that Hillary Clinton is not doing so well in the black community I said we should have black reporters come together with her\nAnd in sauce with ... I did see the back and forth exchange with\nKaren Finney indirectly like old April's wrong [noise] it's not that bad who [noise] have always right [laughter]\nBut what would you leave doesn't tell you is that I was calling Donald Trump's people were calling his secretary at Trump Tower trying to get an interview I was asking number Rosa they don't tell you that was talking to Ben Carson's people\nAnd I'll tell you I was talking to Ted Cruz is people are Jeb Bush has people they don't tell you I was also talking to to a Bernie Sanders people that's what they don't tell you but it's all one side of the um and then so that that I'm supporting Hillary and I'm trying to do all this so I'm like well whatever\nSo then in her warped way of trying to make people think that I've done something wrong to cut our friendship off she tells people I'm taking money from Hillary Clinton\nUh-huh yes that will kill a career\nI've worked hard my parents' sacrificed for me and they're gone the glory and I would do them a disservice if I Would have fallen under that track\nSo I talk about it in the book but um she all all of this was in efforts for her to look good and the Trump Administration so when it comes to reading her book no thank you\nWhen it comes to her tapes yeah those are tapes but like she take me she takes the portion that she wants you to hear [noise] put it in context and consider the source\nAnd he denied it but still I Want to hear from I'm going to listen and I look at it and I want to get it on tape because I Want to put the pieces of the public gets when it's when it's in chaos and dismay you can't put it together but at least you can kinda see a little bit more clearly in that murky mess\n[noise] what's going on but um no I mean you have to talk to people you have to listen to what people have to say that sometimes there is truth within the law or the live with them the truth I don't know and [noise] you know one of the reasons I I Love the commonwealth club audience is because they have such good question I'm scared\nSo here's another [laughter] I can you comment on Trump's attack on female reporters thank you is this workplace harassment [noise] so\nYou're talking about what happened today [noise]\nAll right I'm livid about that how did you bring some folks up to speed maybe okay how many have you watched it today how many have you heard the news accounts of it today okay there's a large portion of don't know okay ...\nAnd I'm Caitlin Collins Cecilia from ABC and Caitlin from CNN Caitlin\nJust within the news a couple of weeks ago asking questions in the oval office and he wouldn't answer when he asked his other people's questions ... an Oval Office ash\nReporters we are supposed to question and here's the thing these press conferences up until now I mean\nWhen did they have press conferences just on one issue there are thousands of issues that are happening at one moment in time the White House is where everything comes war and peace and everything in between\nAnd it's not just a moment that it's just this week on North Korea out there we got Kavanaugh we've got voting issues we've got me to we got so much stuff on the table and that's not even it wouldn't be got China we've got a or a wrong we got a lot of stuff\nWhen we got water they're still not safe to drink you know we've got Nike you know stuff out there you know we got the steel is the last of the ravens\nLast night [laughter] so ravens [laughter]\nBut um but no but ah so the president decides to shed Caitlin damage that's I Know we're talking about we're talking about this ... and he was just really nasty to her [noise]\nSilly Sicilia gets up and says something I\nSomething what did she say I I'm confused\nFrom some of the law to he's a yeah you don't you don't know what you're doing or something along\nThat line on a national international TV demeaning this woman and you know what happens now when people see to say they're going to say that to her and it was taken out of context 'cause she may have been confused with who he was going towards something so I wasn't there today because I was coming here to be with you but when I saw it I\nContest because she may have been confused with who he was going to or something so I wasn't the edited because I was coming here to be with you but when I saw it on the torture and I went off because it makes not one ounce of sense\nIt makes not one ounce of sense because I'm I'm a I'm telling you because\nThey residue from that stuff when he they when Sarah\nAnd the president do that stuff to me I could death threats yeah it's real and that's almost say but women are important men are important but women\nAre so important and at a time such as this here me less than six weeks out from a midterm election I don't care who you vote for but vote but [laughter]\nThank you [laughter] [noise] we too many people\nWere bruised bloodied and had hoses and burning their flesh and dogs tearing their skin is for the white foster vote and I'm Sorry you vote please black white Jew gentile Protestant Catholic\nGo to those polls politics is personal but go vote your personal or whatever\nSo here's the deal less than six weeks out of an election now this is this is from a reporter stance is from a human stance and this is from a woman's dances from a White House correspondent and from a dean of the White House press corps whose voice means something who covers them okay yes\nI might be two years old but I still cover them so let me say this to you it bothers me\nBecause we they demean us they're not he might do it to Jim Acosta but he's doing it to women he's done it to me he's doing these women a credible they ask great questions with the problem is they're angry\nThey are angry at the questions we ask because they know we are making a difference and that's one thing that Steve Bannon and when I said we're making a difference people are listening and they're getting they're listening with the critical easier to understand we're not asking these questions oh mystified what did you think about the wind today was a too windy\nAnd now we're asking real questions about having a\nAt a time and for this president to react\nAnd this is another thing for this president this Republican president too we act like that against the White House press corps at a time when we're sick\nAre less than six weeks out from an election and his party is losing women and independence he's not thinking about his party or his his obligations the White House he's thinking about his person that's from political and and reporting analysis that I've seen over the two years\nI'm up close with him so now\nThen at a time when we're dealing with Kavanaugh this makes a difference with Kevin I'm gonna tell you why you got women out here who who are crying because they have been sexually assaulted and felt that the forwards pain\nAnd Dr Ford\nIs looking to this president the leader of the free world for help with the FBI and then he downing women how does that make her feeling women feel those are the things that are on the table this is a historic moment in time it's not about playing this press conference about doing the press conference\nIs not about going against women\nAnd in in them and tell you the Republican Party is going to take a hit for that today there's a poll from CNN the sense that they don't like how the president is treating the press\nI was one of the first ones that people started to sing they saw this today\nThey saw you can't shake you know everybody wants to shift history but this you saw this if you didn't see it and Googling YouTube it no I'm Serious it's painful to watch it makes me feel like we're back in ... and caveman days women are objectify we don't mean anything\nBut you know it's not about gender it's about us being credible journalists that\nCaveman days women are objectify we don't mean anything\nBut you know it's not about gender it's about us being quiet noble journalists that you trust and disrespected like that by the leader of the free world and those white men and I'm not saying this was a disparaging way but those why because Washington is a male white male dominated down\nAnd those were women the women and minorities don't fare well in a town of we've before every stride that we make will pull back those white men were standing behind him smirking and laughing and did not help the situation [noise] so all of them because\nThat [noise] and I'm\nA I'm a lover of everyone here I have friends of all races creed everything\nBut I'm going to tell you I Believe in every one being\nOn the same footing I Believe in equality I Believe in calling it out when it ain't right gone it and that's when you call it out that's a part of the American democracy what we were founded on we the people who are still forming a more perfect union we're going through growing pains right now and the only way to fix it is to call it out [noise]\nAnd that's\nAnd that's part of freedom of the part that's like part of the first amendment of the constitution and if we don't call if we just sit there and let it happen the first amendment the freedom of the press part is going\nTo be gone we got our founding fathers our founding fathers these wonderful men who I'm sure had slaves ... did not anticipate April wind a descendent of a slave to be questioning an American president I stand\nOn with the world they didn't expect that they were going to have a ... or a Donald Trump is president but we still stand on what they said\nThis present took an oath of office to uphold the constitution on January Twenty one twenty Seventeen\nAnd that part there's a problem we need to call it out because if we could press to shut us down you're not going to get the information is that about us what about you freedom of press is about your freedom of information from the highest office in the land and transparency 'cause right now you and I haven't press refunds and you're not saying nothing\nTrue [laughter]\n[laughter]\nAnother question for you but [laughter]\nAll the insults analyze that White House\nPress conferences has the press considered not attending a holding their own conference\nHere [laughter]\nIf we so willing to hold our own Prescott okay okay [noise] no let me say this\nTo you I've heard every once in a Jewish or boycotts user boycott\nNo ... I'm going to tell you why\nAs soon as we walk out those door to door to boycott they're going to shut the door on a and every time we lose ground we don't gain it back so we have got to stand we've got to continue when they come with the lie or spin we've got to come back with the fact we got to fact check we're not going\nI boycott our protest is fight back effect they all morning on us we're not that\nI fight is information we can't be we hate the ... we hate the ... no I still have respect for the office I still have respect for him but I'm going to call you out when you're wrong right", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Commonwealth Club of California", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "23"}
