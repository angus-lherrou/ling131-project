or even just making a speech or it's really fun to be back in one of my favorites are ... and the world's Francisco so I'm happy to be here\nAnd thank you all for taking the time to come out and I hope the the the\nSort of part of your check list in terms of good citizenship because we have a lot to talk about right now\nWe really do is I mean the question of what our ... in life but how do we make our politics work there's so much to talk about I was younger day I noticed this really is true\nThere was a report on info wars\nBut how do we make our politics work there so much to talk about I was the other day I noticed this really is true\nThere was a report on info wars that Hurricane Lane was bearing down on Hawaii had been split into by an energy being was fired from Antarctica by me\n[laughter] [noise] um [noise]\nAnd and I thought well I I thought I thought to myself now we have really a ... this is terrible stuff\nHow can they how did they missed the fact that I fired at from from the north pole on but seriously I very upset that they ever called David ... action for Florence coming out on the east coast but this is just we're dealing with a whole different world and for those of us who\nReally do love our country and who consider ourselves patriots and who are on or the role of truth in the sustaining of our democracy or this is a very Pearl is an important moment so I look forward very very much to the conversation\nIn Kim I Know there'll be lots of questions from the audience but tell us again why did you sign on and reflect on your lawn I live\nBy that I think he actually gave part of the answer\nNo no I yeah I did get part of the answer\nI I did it because I think it's relevant to the moment that we're in I think Bob Woodward's book is a terrific summary and extraordinarily well reported as he does and every one of you in here knows that there is no way is publisher of the my publisher to and there is no way\nThat he is going to go to print\nWithout the lawyers being confident about sources and what he does has hundreds of hours of tapes so people need to be careful what they wish for in terms of documentation here and yellow or you're going to hear denials here and denials there but I think everybody knows how it works my book\nIs the sort of okay it's terrible we now have the facts that document what is happening but what do we do about it\nAnd what should America look like what should we be doing in terms of making our system work and bring ourselves back to ground zero [noise] damn democratically little D\nAnd um I think my book in the tracing of the things I've been involved in from the beginning of my raising my right hand there's a chapter called raising our right hand where I talk about why we went in the service my my parents were greatest generation parents my mother\nI'm born in Paris or live the better part of our early you're not the better by all of her early life in Europe because my grandfather was a was a\nBusinessman involved in a business in Europe at the time and live between England and France right up until World War two and\nA actually way back when he was involved with the actual Janine in the founding of the bank of America and\nTo my regret sold his stock too early [laughter] uh\nUh so my mother didn't come to America really into ... about twenty four years old but she's American she comes from the Boston family and\nAnd she lived there and that introduced me to war at a very young stage I writing a book about how my earliest memories walking with my mother in France Nineteen forty seven I was four years old and holding her hand and she was crying\nAnd I didn't know why she was crying it upset me but\nI could feel that you could hear the glass crunching beneath my feet as we walk through the ruins of would have been the family home and all that I remember seeing a chimney go up into the sky and a and a stairwell going up in ...\nThe ruins of what had been the family home\nAnd all that I remember seeing a chimney go up into the sky and the and a stairwell going up into the sky it was all of us left\nI remembered visiting the beaches of Normandy four years after the war there was still the ... civil war on those beaches blown out tanks and so forth Higgins boats and it became it it it it just imbued me with a sense of service sense of duties as a responsibility and a group of us at Yale uh\nMy good friend Freddie Smith the founder of FedEx who\nFounded FedEx really in our dormitory when he got to see on his economics paper that\nThat was fed ex um and it's an a plus now folks plush flush uh and and my room mate Danny our bureau in end of the Marines and and you know a bunch of us felt a sense of responsibility in Nineteen sixty five\nLyndon Johnson asked for troops and and we were part of that answer [noise] so I write this because I think all of that journey\nWithout any arrogance without any sense of wild look at me or something that's not what it's about I think it's an American story I think it's an American journey and I think it represents how you make America the best of what we know it can be because of Nineteen Seventy one we had a president who broke the law\nAnd and we had a president who has had an enemies list and who attacked a governance and attacked people uh we had bombs going off in communities in America we had pipe bombs had streets burning we had assassination of ed Medgar Evers Robert Kennedy\nDeveloped countries doing more and less developed countries which is a killer formula I pointed out that this was the single most ... shared responsibility you could have lie because each country decided itself what it was going to do\nAnd no country decided to do anything that he couldn't do\nThat's why President Trump outright lied to Americans today pulled out because he stood up in front of the country and said this agreement push too great a burden on the United states\nAnd the answer is no it didn't\nIt only undertook to do what we knew we could do with the support of major fortune five hundred companies ranging from the Google and the apples and so forth all the way to Exxon Mobil and BP and others all of them said we need to do this so we cannot have parts of what was the significance of powers\nThe significance of Paris is that we\nBasically put our faith in the private sector which I Believe I I've grown more and more private sector oriented over the years because as you watch the world changing as the dynamic changes we're witnessing industrial revolution sized changes and culture and society and workplace\nIn trade and in in globalization but it's happening at digital pace\nIs unprecedented and that's part of the anger that is filled American workers in the American people because they feel increasingly disenfranchised and shocked and shell shocked by it all uh and watch a lot of the voter that Donald Trump appealed to by the way it's also a voter the Bernie Sanders appeal to\nAnd it's out there it's also in the center you don't have to be on the right or left to feel that way government is not working in America folks and we know in some of the reasons why and what we have to do about it but\nThe bottom line with us back to the climate changes we were trying to send the message in Paris to the private sector one hundred and Ninety six countries are all going to move in the same direction at the same time and that creates the largest market the world has ever seen\nThe energy market and why energy because energy is the solution to climate change\nThere's nothing we can do to change the course were on that\nIsn't subject to making better decisions about how we create electricity what we do with our buildings how we burn oil or gas or coal and other things and how we moved to a renewable sustainable future the market that I knew in Massachusetts I represent Massachusetts twenty eight years we had a terrific tech\nBase not quite Silicon Valley but an earlier is very very strong and still strong and we had a one trillion dollar market in the Nineteen nineties\nWith with what a one billion users the energy market is today four to five billion user market and a multibillion dollar market\nAnd it's going to grow to nine billion users and the next Thirty years is the biggest market the world has ever seen and by Donald Trump pulling out of Paris has pulled us out of the position of leadership and in that market so but here's the rub\nThis is why I said I'm going to be the skunk Paris goal was to keep the rise in the earth's temperature to two degrees centigrade we're probably right around one point three one point\nWas to keep the rise in the earth's temperature to two degrees centigrade\nWe're probably right around one point three one point five already today we're right there but my friends in this century my grandchildren yours are going to live to experience\nA four degree rise in temperature\nFor degrees is what we are on track to see now what you see barreling towards the coast of the Carolinas today the size of the storm intensity that repetitive with which it formed is a direct consequence of the warming of the water and the increase of the moisture you have therefore in the air\nAnd therefore more rain Harvey Irma and Maria all deposit at\nOne storm Harvey alone deposit it as much water as flows over Niagara Falls and an entire year five days of flooding and Irma\nWas the first storm to have a recorded one hundred and eighty five miles an hour sustained for twenty four hours together these storms cost us two hundred and sixty five billion dollars one third of the entire budget of the defense department and more money than the Commerce Department the Energy Department of education department the by the whole bunch of departments together this is insanity\nInsanity as secretary of state I went to Norfolk, Virginia and the largest navy base in the world and we talked with the military but what they're having to do because of the preparations they debate because of climate change and the rise of sea level I went to Antarctica because when I went to the Arctic the scientist there said\nMr Secretary you got to go in the Arctic go to really understand what's happening in terms of the changes so I went to Antarctica and lo and behold yeah I heard from scientists room Seventeen different countries about the repetitive with which the west Antarctic ice sheet which is three and a half miles deep ice is melting and and shows a Fisher\nLarson ice sheet broke off larger than the size of the state of Rhode Island and floated out to sea and they're afraid that the whole thing may melt\nThe right way we're going the Himalayan glaciers are melting glaciers are disappearing all over the world we're seeing\nThe diminished ... of this cycle and now you have an open seat in in the northwest passage in the summertime and people trying to exploited I mean it's changed last year for the first time in history we're recorded above freezing temperatures in the Arctic in February\nSo you know I get angry when I when I think about this Donald Trump's decision to pull out of that agreement is going to cost lives\nIt just is as good a cost billions of dollars of damage to property and you're going to witness on that and the next hours next days but that's just the beginning we've had an average of seven hurricanes a year since Nineteen Seventy two in the Atlantic which is more than normal\nAnd now they're two other hurricanes behind Florence that are sort of building out there so my friends what do you do about it\nWhat is the solution would be doing well I'll tell you what the ... United States and if I were president today I Would have an emergency meeting of the G twenty I take the richest countries in the world and I say we're not leaving the room to we put together a\nClimate action fund that helps less developed countries not have to build a coal fired power plant and we should stop every single coal fired power plant in the world from being ville [noise] that's what we have to do why the dirtiest fuel in the world and it is the single biggest culprit with respect to global climate change\nAnd we're at a point now where we are locked in not just to preventing this from happening were locked in the mitigation adaptation so we're going to have to do things like the Dutch do to prevent see from coming into the country this below sea level but guess what a lot of other places have got to\nFind that challenge already the mayor of Miami is pumping water out of Miami Beach and the mayor of Miami Beach that mine is pumping water out in order to get sunny day Hi\nOut of Miami Beach and the mayor of Miami Beach Miami is pumping water out in order to get\nSunny day high tide flooding out of the way so we have water coming over the Boston or in in in Boston at the seawall you know that comes in at a high tides any day now\nSo my friends long answer to you but I got to tell you something this is the one of the most serious issues we face is excess central it is solvable\nThere was no excuse run not moving more rapidly to alternative renewable energy solar is now completely competitive with coal is cheaper than coal 'cause\nThere's no there's no truth and accounting I don't know how many of your business but you know there's no truth in accounting and in this business today people say oh Cole is a three or four cents a kilowatt hour and solar is going to be successful with solar isn't a solar is letting contracts in the world at two point nine cents per\nKilowatt hour and so forth but coal which it doesn't ever taken the cost of coal sludge\nCoal dust black lung moving it by train or trucks from wherever it comes from the burning the cost of emphysema the cost of of of you know the single biggest cost of children being hospitalized America during the summer is\nEnvironmentally induced asthma we spent fifty five billion dollars a year to deal with that and we can't find a hundred billion dollars to fund the ... and ... so I'm just telling you folks were the greatest democracy in the world we're not\nMaking choices about the future we've got to start to reclaim our democracy and reclaim our future by making real choices it's that simple\n[noise] this is the commonwealth club of California radio program you can learn more about the commonwealth fund its many programs and how to become part of the commonwealth club Don more you can find thousands of our podcast\nOn iTunes and Google today's program features John Kerry in conversation with me or your daffy now back to our program [noise]\n\nAnd we're experiencing a lot of the impacts here in California we've had a couple of hundred thousand acres gone up in flames this last year the smoke the health consequences of the smoke uh\nWe have a seawall issue here in San Francisco and San so if in fact our ability to accomplish the things that the federal level is impaired at this point there's a certain amount of us thought that\nStates are going to have to take the lead a and I think that's Jerry Brown's attitude and he's just a announced a\nAn objective of having a California run completely on clean fuels by the year twenty forty five so what do you think about this idea that the the unit of the political unit for focus is really states at this point\nTheir arguments about what happened to John Tower nominated circulated fence their arguments with what happened to Robert Bork blah blah blah but\nReally it took hold in the Nineteen nineties where the Gingrich revolution people that I saw it as people band that come over to the Senate who are just more\nReady to say ideology first one way my way or the highway little less involvement and you have people who've tried to block that a little bit Jeff Flake from Arizona and and Bob Corker a little bit from Tennessee a but it's been tough it's been tough but I Believe\nYou asked me what can we do look folks I Hope don't let this sound naive because I think in my book as you you'll see the\nThe continuum that people\nMake the difference every one of the major movements that may change happen when it needed to in the late Nineteen sixties civil rights Martin Luther king kids some of my classmates\nWe raise money for the freedom buses the freedom rides where people get on those buses and go down south to register people\nTo vote in in Mississippi and Alabama places the Mississippi voter registration drive drove us motivated and run really in large measure by young people the environment ... young people the anti war movement Sam Brown David mixture\nBunch of people young people did that marched link are these ... they took time off from school they went and made a difference\nI Believe in that still we called them the peanut butter and jelly brigade that went up to New Hampshire they they supported Gene McCarthy they send a message to the president nine states Lyndon Johnson you shouldn't run again and it was after the march primary that Lyndon Johnson took himself out of that\nGene McCarthy they send a message to the president nine states Lyndon Johnson you shouldn't run again\nAnd it was after the march primary that Lyndon Johnson took himself out of that so look at what I set about Earth Day look at what I set about environmental legislation look at what happened in terms of accountability for Watergate and then the Watergate babies who went to Congress and what we were able to do so yeah\nIt moves slowly sometimes it's not as responsible as you'd like to be Winston Churchill said that democracy is the worst form of government\nExcept for everything else think about it\nWe've tried everything in the world ladies and gentlemen we've had dictatorships all over the place we had a monarch for a while here so we threw off the yoke of that we've had constitutional monarchy we've had parliamentary Marta ... we've had socialism communism we've had you name it\nWe've we've we've seen it experimented with one place or another and I still believe very very deeply that if you work at it properly and and the public is able to hold people and things accountable and you go vote or you can make a difference and here's the magic number fifty four point to\nThat is the percentage of eligible Americans who voted in twenty sixteen when block Obama was elected in two thousand and eight it was sixty two point\nThree percent when he was reelected\nAgainst Romney it was fifty eight point five I think so you see the gap the story of the last election is not the people who did go out to vote for Donald Trump's people who didn't vote and nine percent of the rock Obama's vote went\nTo Trump and seven percent did not come out and vote that's sixteen percent that swing\nThat's why I Believe as I sit here today I'm not kidding you I'm not Pollyanna air ... I'm not being naive we\nCan make our democracy work but it is work it's hard work you have to go out and be part of the game and you have to drive people to go vote you have to go vote yourself you've got to give money to campaign so it can compete you've got to take part in it and and ... I I\nJust ask you remember the words of Ben Franklin\nWhen he walked down the steps of constitution hall after they had finished their labor on the next generation of the constitution the United states and the woman shouted at him Dr Franklin tell us what do we have and he said Dr oh she said do we have a monarchy or republic and he said a republic if you can keep it\nIf you can keep it that's the work of today I kid you not\nJohn McCain you've talked about other colleagues in the ... a Republican and I all cross or at times you had a long relationship he leaves your fellow Vietnam veteran what do you have to say about John McCain and how how you worked with him and and your relationship with him over the years\nWhile I miss him as as I think America witness in because he was a a truth teller\nA he knew he had some deviations himself one was on climate change when he was running for president because of the orthodoxy of his party and he was up front about those kinds of things which is one of the things people appreciate that about him but he had a as I wrote in an op ed after he passed away he had a great capacity for forgiveness\nWhich is which is partly what you need a what we need in our politics a little bit in the country John and I didn't know each other well when we went to the sun I got to the Senate before John to\nTry not to let them to get any given day as about two years apart and he came to campaign against me Massachusetts though he never attacked me never mentioned by name and just talk to the other guy I write in the book about how that so that was the way the game was played back then not any more but then\nBut in the Senate we were one day\nWe're on a delegation flying to Kuwait after the Desert Storm and a ... Kuwait was just liberated and we flew over\nAnd flying to Kuwait after the Desert Storm and a ... Kuwait was just liberated and\nWe flew over to ah talk to the troops and thanked them but also to talk to the mirror and the other folks and see where we were going John and I were seated opposite each other he was flying backwards I was lying forward sitting opposite him which were assigned by seniority that's why it was important and I got there before uh\nAnd we started you know we we were uncomfortable little bit because I was the war protester and he was the W. so\nWe started to talk about the navy were both navy guys and we both love the navy I Love the navy than like war but love the navy and we talked about I I asked them about Annapolis and what it was like to have a grandfather and a father for star admirals the weight of that what did that\nAffect them in the in the in the academy and blah blah blah so we had an amazing conversation that night but out of it\nCame a willful determine commitment by the two of us which we made that night on that plane that we were going to work together because we both agreed that the war was still tearing America part is Nineteen eighty this Nineteen Ninety Ninety One and so we decided we're going to work together to try to make peace peace with non\nAnd peace with ourselves in America and it began with the sort of\nAbility to look beyond how we felt about\nEach other's positions on the war he was pro war he came back\nAs an upset at the people who are protesting the war because his war stopped the day was shot down Nineteen sixty seven and they have to hang on everything he had and believe for all those years in prison camp my war was Nineteen sixty eight and sixty nine\nAnd when I came back I got to go around the country and argue against the war so we came from very different places but\nMy friends we\nWe found the most amazing common ground we work together for ten years to try to change that and um we all do but they did when he first with George Herbert Walker Bush we lifted the embargo with President Clinton we normalized ah we're we we\nMostly ... answer the questions for seven hundred families to date about what happened to their loved ones in Vietnam because we set up the most\nIn depth intrusive accountability system\nTo be able to know what happened to somebody in a last scene last known alive report and there was a mythology remember in the early Nineteen nineties the cover of Newsweek had are they still alive prisoners in Vietnam and tiger cages and there was a mythology Rambo food films that\nWe'd forgotten people over there so we have to undo that first and we went to amazing lengths to do it we went back to Vietnam I went back with John McCain we we we had to helicopters flying into hamlet sway the sound of a helicopter would\nBring back horrible memories of the war we we had a history houses we'd go in and talk to the people we actually interviewed general job and we interviewed the jailers of John McCain and his fellow prisoners so we had this most exhaustive effort and in the end ladies and gentlemen I'm so proud that that that\nNot only be get the answers and that's ongoing today\nToday is we're sitting here in this theater we got American Soldiers on the ground in Vietnam trying to get remains back for families and and John McCain and I visited the cell he was in together we stood together and and I realized\nThen that we had found this special common ground and if a POW at a protest or can do that about Vietnam in Hanoi we can do that anywhere in this country and make things better so it's a great story about what people could\n[noise] um [noise]\nTurning to another Asian country with which we have a ... relationship\n[noise]\nTurning to another Asian country with which we have a ... relationship if you were secretary of state what would you be doing about North Korea today\nWhat we did you know there's not a great I mean there's a ... style and in the process\nBut an objective and based approach we we wanted to try to sit down with North Korea we we tried very hard to get the north Koreans to come to the table but we were tougher in wanting certain definitions defined before we did so mind you Kim Jong un's father and grandfather both wanted\nA meeting with the president United States and they never got it why did they never get it because we were never able to get satisfaction\nWith respect to what they were willing to define or not to fine I think that\nDonald Trump was just in such a rush to have the glitz of the meeting and have the theater of the event there just wasn't the groundwork done to be able to get a communique that actually defined what denuclearization meant for all the parties or how you would have a first step", "show_name": "Commonwealth Club of California", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "14"}
