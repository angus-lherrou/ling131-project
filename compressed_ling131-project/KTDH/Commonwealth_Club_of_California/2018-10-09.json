with a different cultures that people didn't even know existed until a century before sort of expanding people's horizons so all of these things we don't really know what was the cause but um but they all seem to come together\nAnd I want to unpack some of these ideas now so when you say reason I think that means something different nowadays than what you on you unpack in the book we what do you mean by reason\nRationality logic or LA it\nDoes that in good yeah rationality logic as opposed to\nAs opposed to dogma as opposed to parsing scriptures as opposed to authority as opposed to conventional wisdom or as opposed to\nGut feelings that the feeling of subjective certainty and after the glow of of a feeling that you're in the right because you're you and your your um this Internet infallible or that someone\nElse who you admire assessment they are on this into our infallible superstitions a dog my fair a so those are all alternatives to reason\nAnd science I I think of science the application of reason to the the natural world so not all of reason to science because there's also logic is also mathematics there's also a moral arguments but when you apply reason to the way the way things are work then we call it science\nAnd then the the one that I I think most people haven't haven't heard of or at least I'm packages humanism\nYeah so humanism is just the idea that the ultimate moral good is to promote human well being that is the\nThe ... the happiness the longevity\nThe knowledge the experience of ... men women and children\nAnd other animals but we'll we'll we'll begin with humans as opposed to now you can say well who could be opposed to that I mean who could be against people living longer and and I'm a been healthier and and uh having enough to eat well there are alternative moral systems such as that the ultimate good is to carry out God's commandments or to maximize\nThe glory of the nation or the race or creed so\nEven though it may seem to be completely unacceptable that you do what makes\nThe most people better off I'd actually in a way it's kind of a radical idea\nI was actually it's a prize to the morality have such a place in this book in that way because I ascribe to reason and science not I don't ascribe that word moral much ... why do you think that it's such an important component here\nTwo hundred academics who signed a statement in support of Trump a ... and I got a couple of months prior to the two thousand sixteen election and the ideas behind Trump is an art counter and like the idea is there's no such thing as a humanities there just tribes either as a zero sum competition between tribes to\nSurrender national interest to global cooperation is to be a chump in a battle of a a tribe against tribe race against race so he's our ideas I think they're the terrible ideas but they are ideas and the west by no means a ... ever shooters these ideas to the debate is going on within the west\nSo did you write this book in response to the rise of of Trump ism as you put it this tribalism that was emerging\nNo I although not at the outset although I did have to incorporate that uh the I I began to book in\nTwo thousand Fifteen I signed a contract for the book in two thousand Thirteen and and so the idea that Donald Trump will be president with a ... came out of The Simpsons quite literally [noise] I mean it was it was absurd at the time\nThe Simpsons has proven to be quite pressure you well you know\n[laughter] ah so it didn't require and this is a pretty uh pretty conspicuous elephant in the room that I could not ignore in a book on progress and so I had to deal with the uh it forced me to confront the fact that the that the west right up to the president has not been synonymous with enlightenment so what\nAre the ones where are you seeing around that twenty Thirteen twenty Fifteen Hi Mose yeah it did inspire either\nSo we were in in in a sense\nIn late ... say something of a sequel to the better angels of our nature book that I published in two thousand eleven which was inspired by my coming across many datasets showing that rates of violence have been and historical declined\nOr a ... you can't come to from reading the news because news covers violence wherever it occurs does not cover tend to cover non violence you don't see a reporter saying I'm reporting a live from a school that's not been shot up or a country that's a\nPiece you don't see a headline saying a Southeast Asia\nA live from a school that's not been shot up or a country that's a piece you don't see a headline saying a Southeast Asia hasn't had a war for Thirty years but\nIt say let's go streets clean things you don't see on the news yeah\nSo when you when you plot rates of violence or time ... that's when you see\nA decline because a rate of violence number of people\nKilled per hundred thousand per year includes both the people who are killed in the ... during the people who aren't killed that go into the drama Nader and that's when you can appreciate something otherwise could elude a protection for\nThe better angels of our nature was on a six historical declines of violence and when I completed the book then I realized that they were actually we went to take that mindset of assessing the world by quantitative measures overtime not over reports of\nThings that go wrong because things will always go wrong there have been a member of the world will never be perfect it would be dangerous to try to make it perfect and you just simply can't have any idea as to whether things are improving or not unless you look at data well if you look at data if you expand the day the look at from violence to other measures of human well being\nSuch as nutrition such as infectious disease such as leisure time such as a democracy such as longevity such as literacy all of those are going in a positive direction too and no one seemed to know about it\nSo you're a cognitive psychologist why do I feel those trends then because when I Know about this\nI I can look at the data and say oh yeah human lifespan is increasing and has been for a long period of time now you know we've flattened out in the last couple of years here in the U.S but by and large it's been going up I don't feel that way\nI feel the the oncoming approach of of obesity and of ah the rise and type two diabetes et cetera it might not just predisposed to good news\nThere well there is um [noise] there's I think there's some systematic reasons why we're our our understanding of the world was disconnected from from a reality one of them is a feature of of human psychology called the availability stick that's a term from I ... and Daniel Kohn um in fact\nWe often assess probability risk danger by how easily examples come to mind how vivid images how striking a narrative uh since what the news does this report\nThings that happen not things that don't happen and the things that happen are more likely to be\nNegative and positive you don't have a headline that hundred and thirty seven thousand people escape from extreme poverty yesterday although the papers could have run that headline every day for the last Thirty years as max ... pointed out or if you combined the nature of news which is to report things that go wrong with nature of cognition\nWhich is to be um affected by\nVivid images and narratives and stories were not as\nNews gathering becomes more efficient we're guaranteed to almost to think that things are getting worse even if as I'm getting better that's one reason\nAnd putting on my scientists that are ... are we evolved in ... in our evolutionary history is that a a situation that we're we're naturally predisposed to because our brains aren't moving at the ... at the speed of ... of news if you will in term yes it is it's development\nYeah I think that that's right that the uh data sets really didn't exist until quite recently where we're
