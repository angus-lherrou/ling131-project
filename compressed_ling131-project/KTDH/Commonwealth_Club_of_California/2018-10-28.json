and forty six books including the nonfiction bestseller eyes on the prize America\nCivil rights Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen sixty five and his new book Mr Williams argues that while President Trump considers himself a protectorate for African American communities around the nation his words and actions demonstrate otherwise to discuss the state of civil rights and the country in general please welcome Mr Juan Williams\n[noise] so\nUh we have a new format you know you be thinking about your questions that you can sum it up here to ask Mr Williams and I'll just sort of get us started but I really wanted to just give him an opportunity to sort of just give us a a synopsis of the book from the outset in his own words as to what sort of\nMotivated him and and what I'm all went into play when he thought about this book the writing of it um and just sort of the whole engagement with his mistakes as compared to maybe other books that you've written\nA professor Taylor it's a pleasure to have you with me and the pleasure to be here at the commonwealth club thanks to all of you for coming out\nThis afternoon [noise] this is a tricky subject because racist so waited in our society for so many centuries not just in the current ah look but the reality is\nThat we are at a critical moment so normally for me\nTo answer to an answer to your question professor\nI have been a tremendously interested in the history of civil rights in the United states in the bigger as the people who have been central to promoting social change on the most difficult issue of race so I've written a biography of Justice Marshall ...\nOff you look back at eyes on the prize you can see that I'm very interested in people who were change agents in this society so I'm Talking about people like you know Chaney Goodman and Schwerner going down south\nAnd Freedom Summer Nineteen sixty four who are these people who would put themselves at risk for the greater good and in that case become martyrs to the car\nBut in this moment I don't think there's much question that if you look at\nWe are as Americans with regard to race you'd say you know\nI don't think there's much question that if you look at where we are as Americans with regard to race you'd say you know in the words of Charles Dickens that was the best of times and it was the worst of times\nIn the sense that it's the best of times you know in my lifetime just ten years ago we saw the election of a black president a black man is president United States in my lifetime\nWe've seen the first black billionaire\nWe've seen people emerge or in terms of the ... in a way that\nUnimaginable people from Michael Jackson to Kendrick Lamar ah we've seen people from Denzel Washington to Jennifer Hudson would Academy Awards or you know we've seen the first sharing the joint chiefs of staff the\nFirst secretary of state African Americans it's I could keep going in this way it's really been an incredible period of tremendous gains and most of all\nMaybe the gain in terms of the black middle class in this country and the gain in terms of black political power right now we have a record number of black people serving in the U.S Congress record number of women serving in the U.S Congress so we've seen tremendous progress but at the\nSame time when you ask people today about the current state of race relations in the country\nRight now people say that worse race relations are worse than they've ever been right now half of the American people forty nine percent say the president is a racist including eleven percent\nOf Republicans so you've come to think what what has happened how could it be that we have such tremendous progress\nSuch tremendous growth in terms of the black middle class black political voice black political opportunity record numbers of graduates from high school and college\nAnd yet people think race relations are going down the two I think you and I both know the answer has to do with the rise of Donald Trump\nTrump who comes on the political scene with the birther movement saying that the first black president wasn't even an American that he's an illegitimate president some kind of Machiavellian candidate\nDonald Trump who then comes down to the golden escalator at Trump Tower and begins calling Mexicans rapists and criminals\nDonald Trump who goes on in terms of the kind of rhetoric that he uses to talk about a black woman as a dog to talk about NFL players who Neal and protest the police brutality during the anthem as s obese who should be fired\nA Donald Trump who says at one point that a un American born judge of Mexican parents cannot be fair to him can't do his job causing the speaker of the house Republican Paul Ryan to say that was the epitome of a racist statement this is Donald Trump\nAnd he has successfully appealed to white anger and fear in the society\nEven as the society is becoming more diverse and especially as we've seen an increase in the number of immigrants\nSo he has become a force of the vision racial division ... division in terms of class in terms of so many ah point subdivision in this society he has been willing to exploit for political advantage so I'll\nStop there but the same time you you ground his own orientation and the anti seeding party of of the Republican Party itself and that you kind of outline the ways in which there he's not the first one and he sort of not an outlier maybe\nOf of the Republican Party itself and you kind of outline the ways in which there he's not the first one and he sort of not an outlier maybe in terms of his lack of decorum but in terms of the substance of his ideas you put him along the continuum of\nApollo there is a continuing but but what you have to understand is that since the sixties since the passage of the sixty four civil rights act since the passage of the sixty five voting rights act as you know at that point President Johnson says we've lost the south now for a generation by\nThe south went from being mostly democratic to mostly Republican in the aftermath of those\nMoves and we know that President Nixon played to a southern strategy with just that in mind we know that someone like President Reagan open his campaign by going down to Mississippi either a and going to the show but county fair or the county where Goodman Chaney Goodman Schwerner were killed\nA and people had lots of questions and we know are going forward from that that there have been issues with the Republican Party as becoming more and more white even as the country became more and more racially diverse but Trump has played this\nSee I I'm not quite in other words ... there'll be James racist and needs it more for blacks than any other president American\nThis I don't I Can't Donald Trump I think the I think why do you have to ...\nYeah because I think LBJ came from Texas came out of that Dixiecrat whole attitude and tradition or but he is someone who would work I think he was a school teacher in fact I with a Mexican children down in border communities he had a sense of that and I think he had a sense of feeling as if he\nCould be larger than life he could be a liberator in the in the winter and it's just very Goldwater was that way too at while he beat go water and member and he he\nPilloried Goldwater for his racial attitudes around the civil rights so that's why I was just the premise of your question OK I'm\nOK okay um so this question is do you find it difficult to talk about race relations while Trump is in office while you're working on Fox News\n[laughter] [noise] well [noise] I can tell you I I I think if this was a a different kind of our inside rip off my shirt and show you show your car and you know because it's so difficult to have\nMeaningful conversations about race especially with my colleagues at five and I mean the good thing about Fox's that I'm there there's a number one cable channel in America and it's\nAn opportunity I think the parents the bubble and to say hey there's a different perspective and a different experience of life and here it is to to me I'm In the arena on a daily basis and\nAnd so the attitudes and the questions that I have to cope with and the kind of on a lot because I'm the exception not part of the mainstream or it can be having\nBut it's just a different reaction when you're in Studio ... is one phenomena that happens to you but when you go out the door [noise] there's a whole another reality in terms of how people perceive you idiot logically I think it was saying um that you were saying that sort of when you out of\nThe studio that oh you mean like a representative of a sort of liberal left perspective in in in in Studio if I'm not mistaken\nWell no I I mean obviously if I'm Talking to Sean Hannity on not I'm not that kind of even conservative right right so you must be the liberal 'cause he's a conservative but it's like that I just give you that as an extreme example but I mean what you ... ... you know in my life\nI think people have often tried to pigeon hole me are you left you write right now where do you fit in there and that was my question to an end in so many areas you know it just becomes a question because I say you know what\nI think their policies that have not been productive I think we need to for example I wrote a book called enough ... which was about the failures of black leadership in this time you know black leadership not going after critical issues like why do we have\nA community is the devil by drug dealer who aren't we aren't there protesting the drug dealers or why aren't we going after\nThe problem of poor quality schools why don't we more aggressive and saying these schools are not serving argument is best interest as opposed to seeing them as simply providing jobs again often times in the black community but failing the black children and I think that's that's short term ... a\nShort sighted thinking well you know so on so many levels I'm willing\nTo question the leadership and then people say well that means you must be conservative no I'm just trying to tell you I think we have to hold political leaders to account black\nWhite Asian Latino if they're not serving the community call 'em out but again that's more outside the studio but at the studio where I work for far right\nI Am position then and posturing\nThere as the lesson\nButton on this other questions related says I Love you under five but how do you prepare for the antics put downs\nThey are as the lesson\nButtons on the other questions related says I Love you on the fire but how do you prepare for the antics\nPut downs and nonsensical answers of Jesse waters and I've I and I fast forward through most of what he says is he um a role or is he playing a role or is he just and immature resentful person\n[laughter] wild tested I have a chance to come speak to this out and found it very interesting no I I think again Jesse represents a point of view and find fat for him\nThere are people who are big supporters and people who find his uh his kind of presentation entertaining and it becomes entertainment but I think it's entertainment that sometimes is at a cost and not so perceptions of common destiny and common interest and common commonality as American\nRelated question Mr Williams how do you maintain your civility working with your colleagues that Fox News who consistently support an echo actions in words of such despicable and the legitimate of of of of a despicable and the legitimate president [laughter]\nWell again I have to cope\nWith the idea that so many of my colleagues are in fact on the Trump bandwagon a and I'm willing to challenge it and to speak out against it and then my hat's off to the idea that I'm there\nAnd the audience for the most part likes me so that's a you know that that's a shock in some ways\nMhm mhm [noise] next question do you face these are free [noise] ah do you think African Americans should join with Latinos or Hispanics et cetera to be a bigger voting bloc and how do you get participation significantly higher well\nI think that what you have to do is make it seem urgent mhm uh and people have to see that it's\nDirectly impacts their lives now we're coming up on these midterm elections and historically minority communities educating people and Democrats do not turn out in high numbers mhm but I think that because this has become something of a referendum on Trump and because of Trump's behavior including\nA lot of his racist behavior I think there is a sense of urgency and I think you're going to see a larger turnout in terms of the consequences so this is all about your life my life our communities our family and when people feel that politics makes a difference I think you see them\nBecome activated too often they felt you know what it doesn't make a difference that you know the Democrats might take you for granted a and the Republicans might ignore you but what we have now is a situation where people feel\nThat they are being demonized and belittle or and hopefully that does create a common set of issues that drive them to the polls\nYou write with a sense sense of urgency and that was the question I was gonna ask you this book is written with a sense of urgency\nAnd I you know I've been around you know the last thirty forty years listening to people talk about this concept of race war and nobody takes has ever taken seriously when you see Bannon out in Italy I'm Steve Miller in the in the White House um\nDid you take the concept of race or seriously at all I don't know what what you mean the idea that there was this project and I think it was coast that will see a way I see that are written a book called the coming race war this whole idea that race war is coming and with the president sort of you know\nFlat fanning the flames that you're saying he's he's full of fanning do you take that concept that the we're going to Balkan eyes as a society with these racial divisions in terms of violence\nOr no I don't think that's coming I think that you have episodes where there's racial violence in the country and people act out or it can be somebody uh you know in terms of we see it with ... to ...\nThere's racial violence in the country and people act out or it can be somebody uh you know in terms of we see it with all too\nFrequent a ... regular with all too much regularity of you know the police shooting somebody and say why did you shoot et cetera and fear of black men and all the rest coming to the forefront but no I think that the nation is on a different track professor which is that we're becoming more diverse and\nAh and in my lifetime a you know I like in the book I say you know Trump is Seventy two I'm sixty four\n... ... you know eight years different but we've lived through this tremendous change in America but he seems to have missed\nWhat I saw happening right right and the growth in the black middle class for example to me\nIs the most important thing that's happened in my life not\nRight right I mean to compare my life and my father as I say in the book that if you know my father\nLived in in his life was defined by his race in terms of where he lived his neighborhood in terms of his jobs right but for me ah you know if he saw me living in an integrated neighborhood if he said you know what you\nWork and have contracts with major American media white owned media you write books for white publishers\nA you know if he saw that his granddaughter my daughter was a graduate of Georgetown University law school and I didn't accept black people until the late sixties but he said that's a different world and if he saw me at the White House having lunch\nAnd then saw that the other guy sitting there with a black man and realize that he's President Obama [laughter]\nHe'd say oh my God like a different universe where I Can't imagine that my dad would say right right so you stop and think about these things that have happened in our lifetime but also in Trump's lifetimes what an amazing thing forty percent of\nBlack America earning between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars in additional twelve percent earning between a hundred and two hundred thousand dollars that means more than half of black America\nIs either on the edge of being middle class or solidly in it and beyond it mhm but he doesn't plug into that notion of people have sacrificed people have been in the vineyards working hard to\nAllow this to her and instead\nHe focuses I think quite intentionally on the dysfunction that chaos in poor black communities\nAnd uses that the story of beer and division in the white community\nBut to your point remember it's the case that blacks are about Thirteen percent of the population one of the another big change in my lifetime has been that Latinos are now a larger group that I write write sixteen Seventeen percent of the population Asian the fastest growing segment\n... ... and that question it is increasingly difficult for you this is again a number of Fox questions so that there's a bunch here um it is increasingly difficult for you to justify your continued association with Fox given how that network program being has evolved\nI guess somebody wants you to comment on that oh here's another question please explain how Fox News your affiliations support or denies the plea for racial harmony you original thoughts about solutions so I guess people want to know about you and and your relationship to Fox 'cause this here in many different forms\nWell as I said earlier to\nMe I think that Fox as such a major platform in American media the number one cable news station in the country or is unimportant\nVenue to have somebody come in and ... burst the bubble I have someone come in and offer a different set of perspectives in fact mhm\nSo I find myself challenging so many of their top personalities and I'm I'm there every day mhm uh and no one is telling me what to say so to me this is an opportunity it comes at a tremendous cost 'cause I feel a beat up much of the time and I say like oh my God you're not hearing but it's not the case that I Am not in fact\nSaying what I Want to say\nAnd trying to reach and it's very interesting uh to pick up on a point I meant and ... I mentioned in passing earlier than that there's so much\nOftentimes positive response from people that people will say to me at a ball game and the airport and the trains whatever they will say to me you know I don't agree with your politics but I like you and I like the fact that you're there you know when I go to the water fountain and I run into people it's not that I haven't heard the other side of the argument\nAnd so I'm performing a function there as a foil but I think also as a a source of a different perspective\nUm this is a kind of a funny one it says you used to be six for you take such a pounding every night on fire [laughter]\nUm let's see ah there's a what would you have again that was the repeated when do you think former President Obama was a pot was a net positive or or for race relations he famously believes he was ten to Twenty years\nFormer President Obama was a pot was a net positive or or for race relations he famously believes he was ten to Twenty years too early Obama well you'd think Obama was a net positive for race relations\nOh I Do uh I think you know looking back on the Obama presidency boy you know I see people in tee shirts that simply said the missed me now and I think that that's very ... what a contrast in terms of uh you know class that\nLack of scandal and all the rest I mean I Can't imagine if President Obama had been involved with a porn star has been you know paying off people lying if his first national security advisor or had pled guilty his campaign manager\nI think I think he would be long be gone I think they will not eat he\nWill he's normally have the scandal that we see with ... why I say I just don't think there's any point of comparison with this question is related to this obviously political pressure and negative media attention don't change Trump's mind or behavior so what we'll do you think he will win a second term what will change Trump and we'll win again\nOkay I think they're two separate issues one is I don't think there's any changing the Seventy two year old man and a who tells people he's a stable genius\n[laughter] so [noise] I I I leave it alone\nAnd I don't I don't I think we've gone past that point they say you can only change people when they're in diapers and I think that definitely applies to Trump [noise] um [noise] as to whether he might win re election well his numbers are just terrible even now um and they creep up at times\nAnd there was some good news for the Republicans this week in terms of approval of the party was I think at forty seven\nJust like slightly above Democrats at forty six in one Gallup poll but if you look at for example a generic party preference when it comes to this election\nDemocrats haven't been able to pull away but they still maintain a strong a margin advantage end when it comes to engagement in energy among the voting base\nDemocrats really have a strong advantage going into these midterms so when it comes to the twenty twenty race I think it will have to do with who the Democrats are able to nominate and exactly how you engage Trump because I think that's very difficult as we saw in the Republican primaries\nIf you try to say hey this guy knows very little this guy you know as someone\nWho says outrageous things cause people names et cetera uh it's not not necessarily effective with his base\nSo his base\nIs likely to nominate him again I don't know if John Case sake or whoever on the Republican side might hold out and challenged him and I think that's possible but I don't see that person prevailing but once it comes to a general election I think if the Democrats\nHave someone who's able to not only take on front but to contrast offer contrast in terms of political stability mhm\nAnd political experience to Trump and uh I think I think Trump's in big trouble mhm\nYeah wow that's that's I think that's news um [noise] what is your perspective on rising uses of smoke a little bit about it but what is your perspective on rising social economic inequality increase housing education health care costs and its impact on the future of minority middle class groups\nYour opinion and also they want to know how related to that how you feel about Bernie Bernie Sanders\nWell I think that let's deal with the first part in the rising income inequality and how it impacts minorities in the country remember as I was saying the earlier you have for the first time in American society a sizable black middle class\nThis to me is a tremendous achieve and I think the two major achievements of the civil rights movement one is that economic\nMiddle class this to me is a tremendous achieve and I think the two major achievements of the civil rights movement one is that economic stability but secondly would be political voices [noise]\nUm and we touched on that with my with Obama but also a record number of blacks in Congress and the like black mayors are right now you have the possibility of a black governor or\nIn Florida in Georgia to Maine Maryland right yeah these are amazing it is so I mean this is again\nPart of the growth and I think you know I don't see how you hold back that wave of change that sleeping America\nIt's almost like Trump is happening up here but there's something else going on with women and with ... minorities electorally are across the country\nWell see I wouldn't I wouldn't exclude whites I think educated whites I think people ... you know and after the failure of the Trump tax cuts yeah I think there are people who are working class whites who say you know I don't I don't see it I don't know what's going to again at that plays into what's going on in the midterms but you asked about how this impacts then\nThe black middle class and well I think they didn't if you look at it the question is how I think the question that would come from the black community to any president is what are you doing\nTo help that black middle class grow and in particular in particular to overcome the wealth gap so that even as you have a stronger black middle class than ever before they remains a tremendous differential in terms of the wealth in terms of people\nBuying houses stock dividends property investments that attends a\nAttaches to the white community and its apps and in the black community so it's more the kind of paycheck to paycheck and people coming along slowly that is the big difference in what I didn't to reiterate Trump is\nTaking away some of those government supports that were put in place to encourage entrepreneurship to encourage or the growth of that black middle class one other point on their says\nWhen Trump comes in and says he's going to drain the swamp he starts cutting government remember Bush comes in Obama comes in and they are repositioning reforming government but at the same time you see small increments and government for minorities\nDisproportionate share of minorities working for government state local but also federal government I think it's like thirty three percent more of a likelihood for minority ... because a bias\nIn the private sector difficulties in private sector employment mhm so when he's whacking at this when he's freezing payments for government workers when he's taking away tax base from local and state government he is impacting that black and Latino middle class in a very real way mhm mhm\n[noise] um this is another question during the Clarence Thomas\nI forgot one thing was about Bernie Sanders yeah how do you feel that very thinking and again I think Sanders it's so interesting there's a real commonality if you look at the numbers between so many Trump voters and Sanders voters they're populous yeah and they want someone thing of disruption in terms of American\nPolitics um but again the difference is that\nThe Sanders voters they the government as having a role\nAnd they do not believe that simply by giving more to the rich that you are going to solve these problems like Elizabeth Warren and the consumer financial protection born you know\nTrump comes in and he wants to do away with that in the argument that he would make is this is over regulation burdensome on business\nWarren and Sanders make the case no what we see is big business in fact exploiting mhm taking advantage of people who are hard working Americans of all colors um and I think that's where the divide comes between the Sanders and the Trump\nAre people who are hard working Americans of all colors um and I think that's where the divide comes between the Sanders and the Trump\nA voting base and but make no mistake about it there's populist energy that I think is rebelling against the idea of the establishment and especially the upper income establishment as looking out for themselves and their children's at the expense of the rest of the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Commonwealth Club of California", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "28"}
