graduate of Morgan State university at historically black universities yes all the other girls and two daughters yes member of the White House press corps for Twenty one years Twenty one so the question first question is how how did that happen\nAnd kid can you give us just a brief look at the journey of April Ryan to the role of White House reporter [noise]\nUh my journey as nontraditional\nTo say the least I Am a product of two people who came from agrarian families um my mother from South to North Carolina forgive me lord because they\nHave a [noise] a North Carolina and my father from Maryland and in\nNineteen sixty seven I was born to two people who just wanted to to build a family together I was the first born of of that union and I was very precocious 'em to say the least that took them seven years to have my brother\nSo [laughter]\nBut um you know I grew up in a household where\nYou remember this you know that's the way it was my father mother watched Walter Cronkite you know religiously\nAnd my mother she was ahead of her time she was an activist um she was on a college campus she toilets at Morgan State university for forty two and a half years until her death and I'm a ... baby so um she believed in people and she believed and advancing causes\nAnd I didn't I don't know I guess I picked it up [laughter] I didn't think I did but sometimes when you're in a setting it comes and just sits on you and it said on me so\nWith my dad I'm In the evenings he would come home from work and he would sit down and watch Walter Cronkite like dad we listened to the local radio local news and I'm like why\nYou always watching the news I mean with so much of a big thing in my home to watch the news but those three stations at the time um remember that and the and the white noise after Johnny\nCarson would go off and you know you know and the flag would come up to five AM I mean I'm Talking about that time so [laughter] um my dad was\nWatching news so much a step why are you watching the news all the time and and and I should have as a child who run from the news when he said this but I just ran two weeks I said that while you're watching as you said because I Want to know when the world comes to an end I'm like oh my gosh\nYou know that it may have wanted to find out about this [noise] so um\nAnd I believe I mean I I Believe\nNow that I look back and that's where the foundation was late for me\nUm my mother was always into current events and she she knew what was happening um you know I always knew about my history I was a kid you know you sit at the kitchen table and you have a peanut do you know how many used as there are a peanut all\nMama George Washington Carver if we talk about blood Charles true\nAnd if you don't know about it and Google it to my mother used to tell me look it up you know when we had dictionaries without the Internet and Google Charles through you'd be surprised and fascinated\nUm you know and we stopped at a stop light you know a black man made the stop okay mama you know [laughter]\nAnd a gas masks I mean she's my mother always taught me about excellence in our community I always knew was going on because we listen to the news and I don't know I just I grew up understanding\nBut I was never socially aware you know went through college I was a DJ in school for as DJ any good where are you going to I was pretty good Hi this is\nSocially aware you know went through college I was a DJ in school as DJ any good where you go I was pretty good Hi this is April Ryan W E\nA a\nDon't know but you know it's like asking why can't you know I needed more I didn't tie into but I don't have anything else to talk about other than just a sharp de [laughter] this is a cry you know like I said anymore but I had a urine ing\nFor news I wanted to get more information so I started I'm venturing into producing a new show and I started into doing news um I remember my last DJ gig was at the station in Baltimore but just to be owned by James Brown\nYes James Brown and then it was owned by ... or the Bronx in the late Dorothy Brunson\nAnd I remember I said this is not for me and I had a urine and I didn't realize it for information that's where it started school my sophomore year started a really getting into news so you finished\nCollege finished and then what um how is working for gospel radio station I'm well while I was in school I was working at various radio stations and my checks were balancing but I was getting the the the payroll\nChecks were bouncing [laughter] and I was but I was getting experience and\nI worked at a a gospel radio station and I was telemarketing at the same time my father never forget a father didn't want me to get in this business because we knew of his black ready or black media you ... you wouldn't make money they sent me to school so I could get off of their paycheck\n[noise]\nI used to come home after school walking home and my little Catholic school uniform I was one of those bad Catholic school girls and a Southern Baptist below Catholic school girl [laughter] I Would walk home and go home and I I'm I'm One of those weird kids I Would I wasn't supposed to go out\nAnd so my parents got home stayed in the house but I you know what I Would do I go to that component said that looked like a cough and not the components that it was a stereo says remember those old it looked like a cough and slides\nA fan [laughter] I wouldn't go through my mother's\nForty five is and and and thirty three and Seventy five and put on the record Dr King is I have a dream speech is I've been to the mountaintop speech\nI was a kid who was that was weird I should have been watching something else on TV or doing homework I was listening\nTo Dr King and reading his speech I mean I felt it as a child so she meant a lot to me so\nI Am there that day I'm trying to figure out am I going to ask the question should I shouldn't I and I didn't make the determination until I delivered it that I was going to cause\nIt wait on me so much and then after I asked the question twice in the ass Mr President you want to answer any question he didn't answer and I mean I felt the weight of the moment I felt the weight of what I done I felt the wave of my history I felt\nAshamed because I'm Mark Dr King's day because the president was there with Dr King's\nNiece and nephew not the children and black Republicans to celebrate this [noise]\nThis man this this dream or who's now he was a march or who's now Marta to celebrate\nThe fact that they were expanding the land around the king center and here I come messing it up that still bother ...\nDo you regret and all the question why not I called him ...\nMartin Luther king the third and asked him I suppose for ... an hour and apologized to use it for what [noise] because I asked he said no no no no you did the right thing and [noise]\nAnd it still bothers me because again you should never have to ask a sitting US President if he's a racist and then on that day\nAnd I didn't realize how big the question why is\nIt landed at ... I did not know I made it a point to pull myself away from TV 'cause I was so upset and I just live my life and because it it not only that I mean I had ... is\nPastor Darrell Scott ... he was going to throw water on me you're right about that and yeah in that room after I asked the question and other reporters were around yeah\nSo let me ask you this film on them to read from your book and this is after\nThe question that as a reporter you're right I have been lied about and talked about all with an effort to discredit me I've been harshly criticized by some and applauded by others and then a little further in the book you write it's a job\nRead it me I've been harshly criticized by some and uploaded by others and then a little further in the book you write it's a job I Love I Do love his job [laughter]\nSo how do you love a job where you are seemingly you have become the story\nAs I get emotional right now talking about that and I and it still bothers me and I didn't realize you know sometimes you don't face\nWhen you face it you feel it but I this is what I studied for this is my\n... I didn't know all this other stuff was going to happen but I I Love this job and I'm not gonna let anyone\nCan al my dream my mother and father's dream for me my community strain and those shoulders that I stand or I Will not I love this job because I'm asking a question I gotta say no no no I'm not going anywhere I Love my job [noise]\nI Do\nHave to tell you all that when April comes on and she's on CNN for example since we see that she she didn't want to start yelling at how the but\nIt didn't watch it if you if you know I was born [laughter]\nLet's go to a a lighter subject such um have you read Omarosa no on\n[noise] on hand have mama why'd you know and I will not and I and why is\nThat lord have\nMercy [laughter]\nAnd your book you write about your interactions with almost ... well let's talk about why I write my interest or a writer interactions\nWith on Rosa alma Rosa is the reason why all of this stuff happened she started it even though she's fired the residue still is there\nI'm a Rosen I and I and I I don't touch on it I don't the book is not about her right [noise] I don't have a tape [noise] and I still I'm a best seller [laughter]\n[noise]\nSo forgive me but I'm a rose and our friends we were close I Love to like a sister while everybody was telling the girl she don't cut your throat I'm like no no no I don't know\nThat's that's just the TV [noise] little did I Know um she hurt me and we we're backstage and it today and it's crazy\nToday I was looking you know when you're on a plane five point five hour flight and you use [laughter] I'm trying to figure out you know okay what's going on what I Do you know looking through my phone and I look at my pitch a so and I go back in time today was the first day I went back in time with my pictures with her and I bought a ... we were\nClose and I showed some of the pictures are families knew each other [noise] I went to our church she took me to Skid Row wishy minister and then this person who is this I'm like so\nIn my take you find a less you getting her way so you get in her way apparently that's sad we can leave it at that if you know I'll I'll talk about it I think it's far to [laughter]\nGet it out and brief [laughter] um no so what happened was um we\nWere friends but that friendship I mean she's she was in it is\nNot a ... not conjecture she worked for Bill Clinton\nUm she was an Al Gore's office when Al Gore wanted me to interview enemy would tell her to call me and that's how we say and back then you know we were both young you know Twenty years I was was it Twenty one I'm fifty one now whatever down to the ... are still young now thank you\nSo um you know\nUse I was was Twenty one I'm fifty one now whatever job do the math still young now thank you [laughter]\nSo um you\nKnow we became friendly and then after she left I got fired or moved up failed up or whatever the White House [laughter] you know we'd run into each other it's the truth we've run into each other around the country and you know she'd be somewhere and I'd be somewhere like eighty plus plus you know get together and we\nGot closer much closer over the years and um\nBut then long story short when she became a part of the Trump campaign I became a target the president did not like the press oh got someone close\nOh I've got a dean of the press corps oh I can get her and make them think that I Am and this can make them except me\nAs a friend will do so she I was in ... and I'm I'm not mad I don't care they can talk about me on with that I think it's a badge of honor that I met with the lakes and the reason why I say that is because any reporter in Washington worth their opinion pad their microphone and video camera\n[noise] should have been ... and I\nSay that because John Podesta\nI've known him for a long time and I was asking John Podesta why is emailed him\nWhy is it that Hillary Clinton is not doing so well in the black community I said we should have black reporters come together with her and then sauce and with ... I did see the back and forth exchange with Karen Finney indirectly like old April's wrong it's not that bad [noise]\nEven was right [laughter] what would you leave seven tell you is that I was calling Donald Trump's people were calling his secretary at Trump Tower trying to get an interview I was asking\nNumber Rosa they don't tell you that was talking to Ben Carson's people and I'll tell you I was talking to Ted Cruz is people are Jeb Bush has people then I'll tell you I was also talking to to a Bernie Sanders people that's what they don't tell you but it's all one side of the um\nAnd then so that that I'm supporting Hillary and I'm trying to do all this so I'm like well whatever so then in her warped way of trying to make people think that I've done something wrong to cut our friendship off she tells people I'm taking money from Hillary Clinton uh-huh yes that will kill a career\nI've worked hard my parents' sacrificed for me and they have gone the glory and I would do them a disservice if I Would have fallen under that trap so I talk about it in the book but um she all all of this was\nIn efforts for her to look good in this Trump Administration so when it comes to reading her book no thank you\nWhen it comes to her tapes yeah those are tapes but like she take me she takes the portion that she wants you to hear [noise] put it in context and consider the source\nAnd he denied it but still I Want to hear from I'm going to listen and I won't get in I Want to get in on tape 'cause\nI Want to put the pieces of the public gets when it's when it's in chaos and dismay you can't put it together but at least you can kinda see a little bit more clearly in that murky mess\n[noise] what's going on but um no I mean you have to talk to people you have to listen to what people have to say that sometimes there is truth within the law or the live with them the truth I don't know\nAnd [noise] you know one of the reasons I I Love the commonwealth club audience is because they have such good question I'm scared so here's another\n[laughter] I can you comment on Trump's attack on female reporters thank you is this workplace harassment [noise]\nSo you're talking about what happened today All right I Am livid about that how did you bring some folks up to speed maybe okay how many have you watched it today how many have you heard the news accounts of it today okay there's a large portion of don't know okay Cecilia Vega\nI'm\nCaitlin Collins city from ABC and Caitlin from CNN Caitlin just within the news a couple of weeks ago asking questions in the oval office and he wouldn't answer when he answers other people's questions ... an Oval Office asked reporters we are supposed to question and\nHere's the thing these press conferences up until now I mean\nWhat did they have press conferences on one issue there are thousands of issues that are happening at one moment in time the White House is where everything comes war\nAnd peace and everything in between and it's not just a moment that is just this week on North Korea out there we've got cabin uh we've got voting issues we've got me to\nBetween and it's not just a moment that is just this week on North Korea out there we've got cabin uh we've got voting issues we've got me to we have so much stuff on the table and that's not even when we got China we've got a oh All right we got a lot of stuff when we\nGot water is still not safe to drink you know we've got Nike you know that stuff out there you know\nWe got the steel is the last of the ravens last\nNight [laughter] go ravens [laughter]\nBut um but no but ah so the president decides to shut Caitlin down and say that's I Know we're talking about we're talking about this we're\nTaught to and he was just really nasty to her\n... gets up and says something I I something what'd you say I Am confused from the lotto he's a yeah you don't you don't know what you're doing or something along that line on a national international TV\nDemeaning this woman and you know what happens now when people see to say they don't say that to her\nAnd it was taken out of context 'cause she may have been confused with who he was going to have something so I wasn't there today because I was coming here to be with you but when I saw it on the torture and I went off\nBecause it makes not one ounce a sense it makes not one ounce of sense because I'm I'm a I'm telling you because\nThey has residue from that stuff when he they when Sarah and the president do that stuff to me I could\nDeath threats yeah it's real and that's almost say but women are important men are important but women are so important and at a time such as this here me less than six weeks out from a midterm election I don't care who you vote for\nBut vote but [laughter]\nThank you [laughter] [noise] they're free\nTo many people were bruised bloody and had hoses and burning their slashed and dogs tearing their skin is for the white for us to vote and I'm Sorry vote please black white Jew or gentile Protestant Catholic\nGo to those polls politics is personal but go vote your personal or whatever so here's the deal less than six weeks out of an election now this is this is from a reporter said this is from a human stance and this is from a woman's dances from a White House correspond says and from a dean of the White House press corps whose voice\nMeans something who covers them okay yes I might be two years old but I still cover them so let me say this to you it bothers me\nBecause we they demean us they're not he might do it to Jim Acosta but he's doing it to women he's done it to me he's doing these women are credible they ask great questions with the problem is they're angry\nThey are angry at the questions we asked because they know we are making a difference and that's one thing that Steve Bannon and when I said we're making a difference people are listening and they're getting they're listening with the critical here to understand we're not asking you for oh ... Mr President what did you think about the wind today was a too windy\nAnd now we're asking real questions about having a\nAt a time and for this president to react\nThis is another thing for this president this Republican presidents we act like that against the White House press corps at a time when we're sick are less than six weeks out from an election and his party is losing women and independence he's not thinking about his party or his his obligation to White House he's thinking about his person that's from political and\nAnd reporting analysis that I've seen over the two years I'm up close with\nHim so now then at a time when we're dealing with Kavanaugh this makes a difference with Kevin I'm gonna tell you why you got women\nAnd then at a\nTime when we're dealing with Kavanaugh this makes a difference with Kevin I'm gonna tell you why you got women out here who who are crying because they have been sexually assaulted and felt that the forwards pain\nAnd Dr Ford is looking to this president the leader of the free world for help with the FBI and then he downing women how does that make her feel and women feel\nThose are the things that are on the table this is a historic moment in time it's not about playing this press conference about doing the press conference is not about going against women\nAnd in in them and tell you the Republican Party is going to take a hit for that today there's a poll from CNN the sense that they don't like how the president is treating the press I was one of the first ones that people started to sing they saw this today\nThey saw you can't shake you know everybody wants to shift history but this you saw this if you didn't see it and Googling YouTube it Mm I'm Serious it's painful to watch it makes me feel like we're back in in in caveman days women are objectify we don't mean anything\nBut you know it's not about gender is about us being credible journalist that you trust and disrespected like that by the leader of the free world and those white men and I'm not saying this in a disparaging way but those why because Washington is a male white male dominated town\nAnd those were women they're women and minorities don't fare well in a town of we before every stride that we make were pulled back those white men were standing behind him smirking and laughing and did not help the situation so all of them because ah [noise]\nAnd I'm\nA I'm a lover of everyone here I have friends of all races creed everything\nBut I'm going to tell you I Believe in every one being\nOn the same footing I Believe in equality I Believe in calling it out when it ain't right on it and that's when you call it out that's a part of the American democracy what we were founded on we the people who are still\nForming a more perfect union we're going through growing pains right now and the only way to fix it is to call it out [noise]\nAnd that's\nAnd that's part of freedom of the part that's like part of the first amendment of the constitution\nAnd if we don't call if we just sit there and let it happen\nThe first amendment the freedom of the press is going to be gone we got to our founding fathers our founding fathers these wonderful men who I'm sure had slaves ... did not anticipate a fool around a descendent of a slave to be questioning an American president I stand\nOn with the world they didn't expect that they were going to have a ... or a Donald Trump is president but we still stand on what they\nThis present took an oath of office to uphold the constitution on January Twenty one twenty\nSeventeen and that part there's a problem we need to call it out because if we if they could press to shut us down you're not\nGoing to get the information is that about us is about you freedom of the press is about your freedom of information from the highest office in the land and transparency 'cause right now you know I haven't press refunds and you're not saying nothing\nTrue [laughter]\n[laughter]\nAnother question for you but [laughter]\nAfter all the insults and lives at White House press conferences has the press considered not attending a holding their own conference there [laughter]\nIf we so we're going to hold our own press", "show_name": "Commonwealth Club of California", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "21"}
