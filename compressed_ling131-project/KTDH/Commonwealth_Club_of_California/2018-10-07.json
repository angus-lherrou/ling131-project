Swedish doctrine ... calls fact fullness\nFullness I like that knowing what the facts are now now should we be\nMy wife is going to call me full of facts later [laughter] how I feel about it why a return to the enlightenment of all the periods of human history to have that kind of crawl back towards whiny lemon it's been two hundred plus years since\nYou know it's it's not it's not it's not a return if I'm calling back it's not you know make bringing bringing back in late and it it's a question of affirming a a set of ideals that were most articulate the stated a during the enlightenment but that are still relevant namely reason science and humanism\nLet's start to unpack those ideals but first a a minor history lesson what made those ideas emerge at that time\nSo we we it's it's a hard question to answer because it only happened once and so with as if any historical event we can't can replay of the the tape a number of times and and the number of ways at times when different directions depending on what immediately proceeded it\nBut a possibly the rise of print and literacy and that if you were to look at something that happened before the say the second half of the Eighteenth century if that's when you want to\nMore or less central to the ah the the light and um it was an era in which the\nPopulation of European countries surpassed fifty percent literacy for the first time in history there was a time at which the costs of printing a book or\nA pamphlet plummeted us there was greater mobility of people and ideas it may have been the historical memory of the wars of religion of the um sixteenth century sixteenth and seventeenth century fat people realize that killing people by the tens of millions depending on their interpretation\nOf the holy trinity probably is\nThe uh the the light and um it was an era in which the\nPopulation of European countries surpassed fifty percent literacy for the first time in history it was a time at which the costs of printing a book\nOr a pamphlet plummeted us those greater mobility of people and ideas it may have been the historical memory of the wars of religion of the um sixteenth century or sixty thousand seventeenth century fat people realized that killing people by the tens of millions depending on their interpretation\nOf the holy trinity probably isn't the best way to run a society in part it was the fruits of the scientific revolution which show that a lot of angel human beliefs were were were outright false of which there are the faith belief that the\nSon wrote revolves around the earth is maybe the most famous example and perhaps the the result of uh the age of exploration that they were all of these continents that teeming with life with people's with a different cultures that people didn't even know existed until a century before\nSort of expanding people's horizons so all of these things we don't really know what was the cause but um but they all seem to come together\nAnd and I want to unpack some of these ideas now so when you say reason I think that means something different nowadays than what you ... you unpack in the book wait what do you mean by reason\nRationality logic uh LA it\nDoes not even that hadn't good yeah rationality logic as opposed to\nAs opposed to dogma as opposed to parsing scriptures as opposed to authority as opposed to conventional wisdom\nOr as opposed to gut feelings that the feeling of subjective certainty and at the glow of of a feeling that you're in the right because you're you and your your um this intimate infallible or that someone\nElse who you admire assessed that they are on this tour infallible superstition a dog my fair a so those are all alternatives to reason\nAnd science\nI I think the science the application of reason to the the natural world so not all of reason to science because there is also logic is also mathematics is also a moral arguments but when you apply reason to the way the way things are work than we call it science\nAnd then the the one that I I think most people haven't haven't heard of or at least I'm packages humanism\nYeah so humanism is just the idea that the ultimate moral good is to promote human well being\nThat is the the ... the happiness the longevity the knowledge the experience of men women and children\n... and other animals but we'll we'll we'll begin with humans as opposed to now you could say well who could be opposed to that I mean who could be against people living longer and and I'm a been healthier and and uh having enough to eat well there are alternative moral system such as that the ultimate good is to carry out God's commandments or to maximize the\nThese are of Florida and counter enlightenment movements to the extent that I mean you're almost ... as I say in the book it it sounds like an oxymoron to talk about the intellectual roots of\nTrump ism but they are they really ... and for a while I thought that Trump was just in a reflection of of raw instinct of of tribalism of authoritarianism but there are intellectuals or defend Trump and they often alludes to counter enlightenment ideas or Steve Bannon considers\nHimself an intellectual ah there were a two hundred academics who signed a statement in support of Trump a ... a couple of months prior to the two thousand sixteen election and the ideas\nActual roots of Trump ism but they are they really ... and for a while I thought that Trump was just in a reflection of of raw instinct of of tribalism of authoritarianism but there are intellectuals or\nDefender Trump and they often allude to counter enlightenment ideas or Steve Bannon considers\nHimself an intellectual ah there were a two hundred academics who signed a statement in support of Trump a ... a couple of months prior to the two thousand sixteen election and the ideas behind Trump is an art counter and like the idea is there's no such thing as\nA humanities there just tribes either as a zero sum competition between tribes to\nSurrender national interest to global cooperation is to be a chump in a battle of a tribe against tribe race against race so he's our ideas I think they're the terrible ideas but they are ideas and the west\nBy no means a ... ever issued this these ideas to\nThe debate is going on within the west\nSo did you write this book in response to the rise of of Trump ism as you put it this tribalism that was emerging [noise] no I although\nNot at the outset although I did have to incorporate that uh the I I began to book in two thousand Fifteen I signed a contract for the book in two thousand Thirteen and so the idea that Donald Trump will be president with a I came out of The Simpsons quite literally I mean it was it was absurd at the\nTime The Simpsons has proven to be quite pressure you well you know [laughter]\nAh so it did require and this is a pretty uh pretty conspicuous elephant in the room that I could not ignoring a book on progressing so I had to deal with the uh it forced me to confront the fact that the that the west right up to the president has not been synonymous with enlightenment so what\nAre the ones where are you seeing around twenty Thirteen twenty Fifteen hind oh yeah it did inspire either\nSo we were in in in a sense\nAnd lightened now was a ... something of a sequel to the better angels of our nature a book that I published in two thousand eleven which was inspired by my coming across many datasets showing that rates of violence had been and historical decline\nOr a ... you can't come to from reading the news because news covers violence wherever it occurs does not cover tend to cover non violence you don't see a reporter saying I'm reporting a live from a school that's not been shot up or a country that's a piece\nYou don't see a headline saying a Southeast Asia hasn't had a war for Thirty years but\nIt said when he was co streets clean things you don't see on the news yeah\nWhen you when you plot rates of violence overtime I that's when you see a decline because a rate of violence number of people killed per hundred thousand per year\nIncludes both the people who are killed in the ... during the people who aren't killed that go into the drama Nader and that's when you can appreciate something but otherwise could elude detection so\nThe better angels of our nature was on a six historical declines of violence and when I completed a book that I realized that they were actually we went to take that mindset of assessing the world by quantitative measures overtime not over reports of\nThings that go wrong because things will always go wrong there there's never been the world will never be perfect to be dangerous to try to make it perfect but and you just simply can't have any idea as to whether things are improving or not unless you look at data well if you look at data if you expand the day the look at from violence to other measures of human well being\nSuch as nutrition such as infectious disease such as leisure time such as ah\nWe went to take that mindset of assessing the world by quantitative measures overtime not over\nReports of things that go wrong because things will always go wrong there there's never been the world will never be perfect it would be dangerous to try to make it perfect and you just simply can't have any idea as to whether things are improving or not unless you look at data well if you look at data if you expand the day the look at from violence\nTo other measures of human well being\nSuch as nutrition such as infectious disease such as leisure time such as a democracy such as longevity such as literacy all of those are going in a positive direction too and no one seemed to know about it\nSo your cognitive psychologist why do I feel those trends then\nBecause when I Know about this I I can look at the data and say oh yeah human lifespan is increasing and has been for a long period of time now you know we've flattened out in the last couple of years here in the U.S but by and large it's been going up I don't feel that way\nI feel the the oncoming approach of of obesity and of uh the rise and type two diabetes etc it might not just predisposed to good news\nIt very well there is um [noise] there's I think there's some systematic reasons why we're our our understanding of the world was disconnected from from a reality one of them is a feature of of human psychology called the availability ... that's the term from a ... and Daniel Kohn I'm In\nThat we often assess probability risk danger by how easily examples come to mind how vivid images how striking a narrative uh since what the news does this report\nThings that happen not things that don't happen and the things that happen are more likely to be negative and positive\nYou don't have a headline that hundred and thirty seven thousand people escape from extreme poverty yesterday although the papers could have run that headline every day for the last Thirty years as max rose or it's just pointed out or if you combined the nature of news which is to report things that go wrong with\nNature of cognition which is to be um affected by vivid images and narratives and stories were not as news gathering becomes more efficient we're guaranteed to almost to think that things are getting worse even if as getting better that's one reason\nAnd putting on my scientists at ... or we evolved in ... in our evolutionary history is that a a situation that we're we're naturally predisposed to because our brains aren't moving at the ... at the speed of of news if you will in turn yes it is it's development\nYeah I think that that's right that the uh data sets really didn't exist until quite recently where we're naturally numerous they uh arithmetic mathematics are recent inventions in human history or have existed for a fraction of the time we've been we've\nBeen a human ... it's not a a catastrophic the fact that our mind goes with\nI samples and anecdotes because after all those are are not only available\nBefore the existence of literacy and data gathering organizations but they do reflect local conditions or as a not a bad first approximation it really is true that there are more pigeons in the city than than than white breasted nuthatches\nAnd you know that without having to do a bird census you don't have to look a day that you could just consult your your image is not the case with your images are are are correct and they often are correct but not when it comes to a world of seven billion people\nSo this is the one of the things that struck me as if that doesn't come naturally to us this idea of of thinking in the world in these hyper rational ways through the lens of data because we are human we are\nAs a not a bad first approximation it really is true that there are more pigeons in the city than than than white breasted nuthatches and you know that without having to do a bird census you don't have to look a day that he would just\nConsult your your image is not the case with your images are are are correct and they often are correct but not when it comes to world with seven billion people\nYeah so this is the one of the things that struck me as if\nThat doesn't come naturally to us this idea of of thinking in the world in these hyper rational ways through the lens of data because we are human we are predisposed to our evolutionary roots aren't you asking us to take a little bit of a leap of faith well to to think this way\nNo it's not a leap of faith it's weeks sweep of education it's the opposite of a leap of faith or that is we [noise]\n\nIt it certainly does require a inhibiting certain impulses in states not going with our our our gut feelings to uh to allow our best state our best reason are the fruits of our educational system to override our intuitions\nI just think back to um I Can't remember exactly when but George W. Bush talking about leading from his good and um how would tractor but that was to see a leader talk about it that way you describe like the leaders that we should really be attracted to are the ones that speak to reason\nAnd science because they're going to be grounded in progress is is that a fair assessment of of your of your point\nYes we'll be the that um the policy should be\nBased on rational analysis for sure I Know of course a politician in a democracy in order to be elected has to appeal to people with all of their biases and emotions and intuitions so skilled politician\nA and an admirable politician will be one who combines the most rational analysis of\nPolicy with the greatest skill in attracting the attention and and support of a of the people of the country so when they don't recall the the person to demagogue ah when they do and that that's probably the\nThe best we can hope for leadership in a democracy\nOr the best we can hope for a few like that is resident right now I'm\nWhy go back two hundred years\nThat timeline seems arbitrary an some point I understand you were going back to the enlightenment but why not fifty years ago or or more realistically for us the even the last ten to twenty because I tend not to to view my life in the context of wow in\nSeventeen Fifteen they weren't doing as well or as I Am now I tend to think about like how I was doing\nA year ago maybe even ten years ago\nWell the thing is that these these trends are a visible not just over centuries but over decades and and over the years I mean not all of them there's always goals that can be reversals that can be sickening lectures\nBut are going back to say extreme poverty or as a nation that's a hundred and thirty seven thousand people a day for the last Thirty years are over ... extreme poverty um when it comes to war and democracy just in my own lifetime I mean I I when I was a college student world had\n... ah ways for things to fail but we can reduce them uh and we don't know how much better than Denmark\nWe can get but I'm sure it's better than than nothing Denmark now\nI Know you said this wasn't written as an optimistic book it was written more as a realistic but uh but I Want to talk a little bit about pessimism um and it it's that uh I I Belong\nWe can get but I'm sure it's better than than not than Denmark now\nI Know you said this wasn't written as an optimistic book it was written more as a realistic but uh but I Want to talk a little bit about pessimism\nUm and it it's that ah I I have long had the sense that a intellectuals dot pessimism was the more serious point of view\nYeah and you're offering something ... you're saying you're offering a rebuke against that idea yeah um it talked about that a little bit your your thoughts are on pessimism\nA in a stand up on that in a second\n[noise] yeah there is a a um a a tendency to give more um ... some credence to to pass them is a there is a financial aid and Morgan house on said that a pessimist sound like they're trying to help you optimist sound like they're trying to sell you something uh [noise]\nI've this may be a reflection of another a psychological feature the cynical the negativity but by us\nThat bad ways I'm a more heavily than good we are we drive losses more than we look forward to gains a criticism stings more than praise a booms ah we\nAh remember recent bad events better than recent good events and so that may open up a a nice for people to remind us of bad things that we may have overlooked and so we do a a scribe greater moral seriousness to to pass in this or that the biblical profits are are a good example we consider them both\nMoral and they warned of him in and do it it's easy it's it's kind of cheap and easy to be a pessimist 'cause they'll always be things that go wrong and you can if you assemble a list of all the worst things that are happening anywhere\nOn the planet any given time it's always going to look pretty depressing now of course something ... tons of things do get worse is not this is not an argument for optimism in the sense that we should always believe things get better\nThings don't always get better and then there's no reason to believe that they will left to their own devices [noise] it's a brother that we should have the most accurate assessment that we can half of the state of the world and the direction that it's going to try to identify what it is that makes things better and do more of them\nI'm being missed allergic but I in my house I grew up and we would watch the news every night and it wasn't good news back then we'd watch Peter Jennings on ABC and there is\nAlways bad news they left one segment at the end that was sort of the good news but it does feel like there is a prevailing sense when I turn on the news now that it feels more pessimistic than ever yeah why are we seeing a trend line in that around and with the coverage of the narratives that we see out there\nIs a good question and it and it I'm a you know I have to be\nCareful not to say this fall into my own trap and say well for the the news is getting worse I read the news getting more pessimistic without any data and so I did find that there is a a data scientist named ... who did a a random algorithm that tallied up\nThe number of positive or negative words news stories in the New York times and in a sample of\nA global new services since the Nineteen forties and found that in fact it has gotten more more pessimistic suggest as people are living longer and there's and and I received death in war been going down and race if literacy even going down the news has been getting\nIt's getting worse I wouldn't have the news getting more pessimistic without any data and so I did find that there is a a data scientist named ... who did a a random algorithm that tallied up the number of positive or negative words news stories in the New York times and in a sample of\nA global new services since the Nineteen forties and found that in fact it has gotten more more pessimistic suggest as people are living longer and there's and and I received death in war been going down and race if literacy even going down the news has been getting more and more morose and so this is a factor says and just a a ...\nWho's leading the horse there is that reflective of something that we writ large as the public is inspiring the media to red light of that or is it the reverse\nIt's a good question if it was just the negativity bias and human nature that would not protect that there should\nBe a trend toward greater pessimism cause human nature I haven't changed in the last Seventy years I it may be a combination of our greater ability to gather news that we can send a well we don't represent news crews new news teams to the remote corners of the world now everyone with a smartphone\nAs I can can beam\nVideo footage to the to the Web instantaneously\nIs partly paradoxically the I'm a kind of a gift of are expanding circle of empathy\nThat we care more about people and not just people other organisms and parts of the world that may have fallen below needs our radar in the past so we care more\nAbout famines in Africa and uh and wars in in in Yemen that our ancestors may happen\nLittle kids being bullied and um and women being sexually harassed which used to happen but just wasn't an issue now it is an issue um and and the third part a possible answer your question is that there is a change I think in the culture of journalism where it's considered increasingly uh especially since the\nSeventies I think that the\nUh mores of\nOf of responsible journalism all we're increasingly been to point out what's going wrong to speak truth to power to to break the mock a and that there was a there is a revolt and I think in the culture of journalism to the old style of\nUh being complicit with um power structures not to show Roosevelt from the waist down because it would be wouldn't look as presidential to overlook JFK's affairs to kind of be cheerleaders\nFor the government now it's the other way round\nPerhaps even gone to an extreme where I every\nA civic institution is considered it'd be a target for an aggressive take down and there's a kind of cynicism that nothing can ever work everything is corrupt which may have had punishes consequences\nBut there has been some criticism of your book a you're not that isn't new to you I'm In one of the the criticism came from from the right especially the religious right who saw this as a rebuke of the role of faith in society a and I'm curious what your thoughts were\nYeah uh yeah I don't think that faith as a role in society I mean there's no faith in the sense of bleeding something without a reason now this doesn't mean that there is no role for religious institutions in society and religious institutions\nOr have evolved um many of them have become more humanistic even if they don't necessarily use that word but um [noise] but yeah I don't think that that any collective decision should be based on a on faith in the sense of the leading something without a good reason on the basis of tradition or dogma or authority\nSo what could be the role of religious institutions going forward\nI mean there's not a fake in the sense of bleeding something without a reason now this doesn't mean that there is no role for religious institutions in society\nAnd religious institutions I have a ... um many of them have become more humanistic even if they don't\nNecessarily use that word but um but yeah I don't think that that any collective decision should be based on a on faith in the sense of the leading something without a good reason on the basis of tradition or dogma or authority\nSo what could be the role of religious institutions going forward than like what opportunities to UC for them it in a world that is is driven by a latent ideal\nWorld religions have a um a a rich historical legacy they they are uh been synonymous with our culture and civilized nation and pretty much I'm Tovia in late and um it was probably will be with your life with you there was even a distinction between religious and non religious uh um institutions\nThey can be so sigh for um communal uh experience for people getting together and enjoying the warmth of a community the reassurance of tradition the beauty of a liturgy and music and I can ... the I think can be civil\nSociety civil society movements to a\nCharities um support for I'm at risk youth\nProviders of of health and mental health services in parts of the world with\nVery weak civil society organizations they can be involved in I'm In a peacemaking in peacekeeping in justice and rule of law I'm some really there's a as legacy institutions that command a great deal of loyalty there is a potential for religion is to be positive\nForces what they ... what what I Would call in and it's not not just me but but maybe it's just not to\nBase or any of the morality on a dog my authority scripture but just to to justify that\nHelp is good and pieces good and living together as good intolerance is good and ah education is good to to the extent that these institutions dedicate themselves to those humanistic values than they can be massive forces for good\nYou've also face withering criticism from um opponents on the left or you are a professor on a campus he's still teach courses and you've been highly critical of politically correct environments on campus and\nAnd you even posted that given rise to some uh some elements in our society they're\nCompletely undesirable can you talk about that\nYeah um I think the ah it to my horror I have had I'm a former students who are gravitated to the ... All right um so these are not\nIgnoramus says these are not skinheads um these are ah in some cases extremely intelligent articulate a people but they have often been repelled by the uh atmosphere of um of of um\nPolitically correct dogma on American campuses uh and and in in certain American media\nAnd often when they\nCome across politically incorrect I'm a facts they feel that the uh entire establishment has been systematically repressing\nI'm a a a a\nSet of facts and feel emboldened that the exact opposite of the establishment must have a a a greater been much more in tune to the to the to the truth and therefore often embrace a extreme and\nThat the uh entire establishment has been systematically repressing\nI'm I Am a\nSet of facts and feel emboldened that the exact opposite of the establishment must have a a a greater be much more in tune to the to the to the truth and therefore often embrace a extreme and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Commonwealth Club of California", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "07"}
