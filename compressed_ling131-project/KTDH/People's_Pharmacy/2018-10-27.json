E. T. were the most common no one knows the implications of this finding\nHow widespread is plastic contamination of the human digestive tract\nScientists suspect that perhaps half the people on earth carry micro plastic around in their guts but this has not been proven\nThey also do not know whether micro plastic particles might alter immune responses or effect hormonal systems what is clear is that we cannot continue to add plastic to our environment and expect to remain unaffected\nCan you really die of a broken heart researchers at Rice University said they figured out quite recently widowed seniors are at greater risk of death\nInvestigators interviewed men and women who had recently lost a spouse those with the greatest grief response had higher levels of inflammatory markers in their blood this may count for the increased risk of heart problems and premature death that's often seen in widows people during the initial month\nAfter the thing is about\nAnd that helped me from the people from the the [noise]\n\n[noise] welcome to other people's pharmacy I'm Joe grade\nAnd I'm Terry grading some fifty four million American adults have been diagnosed with arthritis according to the CDC\nThat doesn't include the millions of people who have soared joints but no diagnosis and it also doesn't count nearly three hundred thousand infants and children with arthritis like inflammatory conditioning\nHow can you manage arthritis pain many people take pain relievers such as a lever Advil but these and says have some pretty serious side effects especially when you use them every day for years what else can you do for sore knees hips and fingers\nTo learn more about arthritis and what can be done to manage the inflammation and discomfort we're talking today with Dr ...

today is Dr Beth ... she's the Reeves foundation distinguished professor of medicine she's also chief of the division of rheumatologist allergy and immunology at the medical school of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n[noise] doctor Janis ... we think about arthritis in terms of joint pain are there other areas of the body that are affected especially by the inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis\n[noise] absolutely and and when we think about rheumatoid arthritis we really think about it as a multi system disease it does not just affect the joints and sometimes patients are surprised about that um many times a patient's with rheumatoid arthritis will have involvement of their eyes and they'll have very dry eyes\nAnd many patients don't think to tell their rheumatologist about that\nUm and I think that's very important and and sometimes the dryness can be very very profound\nRheumatoid arthritis can also involve the lungs many patients with rheumatoid arthritis will have interest dish or lung disease or inflammation of their long for most patients it's not clinically important but rarely some patients can have very severe lung disease that can be life threatening\nUm it can involve the nervous system um it can involve the heart of and we know that inflammation in general\nCan lead to cardiovascular disease and that is true in rheumatoid arthritis and really other forms of autoimmune disease such it's lupus um that we often see an increased a rate of cardiovascular disease even among young women\nAnd we have a a an email from Melissa who says I cured my mild rheumatoid arthritis by curing my leaky got so perhaps the digestive tract as involved as well\nThere's been a lot of interest in looking at um what we eat and our\nThe digestive tract as involved as well\nYeah there's been a lot of interest in looking at um what we eat and are\nSort of got micro Flora and whether that may play a role in body inflammation um I think we're not sort of there yet in terms of making recommendation\nBut I certainly have heard the stories where people have sort of mild systemic inflammation whether it's been diagnosed as arthritis or not and they change their diet and they feel better um and you can't refute that but what's behind that is not really clear well the idea of leaky got is a little\nIt sounds better if we say intestinal permeability it's it's more a more acceptable and to have the gastroenterologist will all tell ya yeah we've seen this um eight eight eight\nFor seven to three three six six is the phone number to call if you'd like to join the conversation we go to Dallas texas Lucy welcome to the people's pharmacy what's this about swimmers need we heard of swimmers year but me\nI uh I've enjoyed my entire life in college I'm going to college I got horrible writers and I said it's because of wear and tear of joined a brush stroke since I was five\nAnd now I'm having actually and my fees and I are wondering if I ever logical off I don't know if that's really good but\nIt's a chronic condition as you know the only thing I ever telling me is pain killers injections and ah as I Am planning for is for driving for over a decade\nDr Janice you want to respond to I'm Lucy at all when we had diagnosis of course we can't diagnose and of course we can't tell her what she should be taking but we might tell her what she should be asking her doctors\nSo it's interesting I I have to say that I've not heard of swimmers need but when I think about swimming we think about it being relatively safe form of exercise for people with arthritis\nAnd so it does make me wonder whether a there might have been you know obviously if you've been to a very avid swimmer and you know what I'm very regularly and maybe\nUm had some injury to some of the supporting structures maybe ligaments or tendons and sometimes\nAn injury to some of the supporting structures can lead to arthritis later in life and that and I think about this I'm Wondering whether that might have been the case um I I I think the question to ask the physicians that are caring for you would be\nYou know what form of arthritis are we talking about it sounds like it might be two or three but I Can't tell for certain um and you're right that that the the alternative um and choices for therapy are very limited so anti inflammatory other energies ex\nLocal injections but I Would say exercise and physical therapy might be very helpful\nThank you very much and good luck Lucy or here's a question for you Dr Joseph because what Lucy is raising is is intriguing to me and that is how do rheumatologist such as you and your colleagues\nDiagnose whether it's rheumatoid arthritis one of those other inflammatory forms of arthritis or osteoarthritis how do you figure out what's going on both coasts what else you do\nTo actually blood tests are really not that helpful um we really talk to our patients I think that's the most important thing we do is we find out when did it start how did it happen what has been your experience in terms of pain or stiffness do\nYou have other medical problems that might predispose you to one or another form of ...\nHow did it happen what has been your experience in terms of pain or stiffness do you have other medical problems that might predispose you to one or another form of arthritis so a lot of what we do is really talking to patients\nAnd finding out more about what's going on with them and then doing a physical examination between our history with the patient and the physical examination we're pretty close we can get pretty close to a diagnosis\nX rays sometimes MRIs and blood tests may I support our diagnosis but we're not going to make a diagnosis really on any test well\nWhen you talk about I'm predisposed and conditions we do have an email from Jean in Elizabeth West Virginia she wants to know if there's any connection between a past diagnosis every medic fever and rheumatoid arthritis now\n[noise] so I don't think so um rheumatic fever really um it's a very interesting disease that we're seeing more in the western world now where you cannot see this very much but it's it's a it's coming back and we've seen it a few times\nOn patients with rheumatic fever I'm have a response to an infection and strip the cocker infection and they can develop an acute form of arthritis [noise] um and then often have a cardiovascular disease but I don't think that that's a predispose you to development of rheumatoid arthritis\nNo Lucy also mentioned that she'd gotten injections\nAnd I'm guessing the injections into the joint with something like a cortical steroid are not uncommon I Know that a lot of my tennis buddies who have injuries we'll get an injection maybe into their back maybe into the hip maybe into their knee\nI've heard that that can be counterproductive on occasion can you help us understand the the benefits and risks of a cortisone type injection into a joint\nThere's no doubt that many patients with arthritis will get good relief with a steroid injection and for some patients that can last a good long time so it's a very good option for many patients\nThe concern is is that over time often there is a sort of laws diminishing returns and so they last\nYou know they don't last as long as they did initially and so people get repeated injections there's some concern that repeated critical to your injections into a joint may increase the risk of the development of osteoarthritis the data around that are really not altogether clear\nAnd we go back to the phones in Aberdeen South Carolina Maggie welcome to the people pharmacy your question please\n[noise] hello Hi I'm I guess I actually have a few questions I'm\nThe first is because I have I have osteoarthritis or do you know genetic on both sides and I'm In my mid fifties I've had to hip replacements\nAnd looking at a potential for a nice replacement um if they're at each your for osteoarthritis or is it just a degenerative disease that you can only really just manage the pain\nWhat their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord so if you're attempting to divide people\nThis is a pretty great subject Saturday on weekend edition from NPR News Saturday morning at seven central\n\nWill come back to the people's pharmacy I'm Joe rating [noise]\nAnd I'm Terry ... if you'd like to purchase the did this show called eight hundred seven three two to three three for its show number one thousand one hundred forty you can also find it on line at people's pharmacy dot com\nTo people's pharmacy has brought you in part by brain gauge developed by you're a scientist at the University of North Carolina to attract brain health home research and clinical applications are available homes subscription options are also available online at gauge your brain dot\nCom today we're talking about arthritis our guest is Dr Beth John it's the reeds foundation distinguished professor of medicine and chief of the ... the allergy and immunology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nShe's also rheumatologist with the un seat Thurston arthritis Research Center and director of the un the mythology fellowship training program\nIf you have a question about arthritis or a story you'd like to share alliance or open at eight eight eight for seven to three three six six if the lines are full you can reach us by email we're at radio at people's pharmacy dot com\nThat Janice topical and that in fact ...\nThe lines are full you can reach us by email ... radio at people's pharmacy\nDot com that Janice topical and sets in fact in the U.S I think there's only one that's approved and that would be ...\nAnd what's amazing is if you go to Italy if you go to France if you go almost anywhere in the world can\nBuy them without a prescription ya so people who travel do sometimes stock up [laughter]\n[noise] yeah so they can actually be very helpful and as we were talking about before the break we know that oral and said have significant side effects particularly on the gastrointestinal tract\nAnd particularly an older patients we like to use ... because they can be very helpful and really do not cause any GI irritation so in that regard I think they are very very helpful [noise]\nThey're very useful for um the small joints and uh but maybe not as much so for the large joined I think they're worth a try for patients because they really do have much less toxicity systemically than the oral drugs\nSo perhaps better for our fingers in thumbs than for hips or and knees are maybe in between\nRight the hips probably not so much the hip is joined us so far away from your skin yeah uh that I Can't imagine that the that the drug is going to actually get there\nBut people have told us that they're nice sometimes get a little better and even elbows but what do you think about the FDA warning because when you look at that warning in the prescribing information it makes it seem as if the topic goes are just as dangerous as the morals\nAnd I don't get it it's interesting I don't think I've ever read the package insert for the topical so you know this has really ... it's interesting but I think again\nTheir prescription medicines you're going to have a discussion with your physician\nAbout you know your individual health care and I think most physicians would say that in terms of the safety they're much more safe and in fact if you look at the guideline from any of the major organizations regarding the treatment of osteoarthritis they are preferred particularly an older individuals because of their\nMore favorable toxicity profile\nAnd we go back to the phones rake in Tampa, Florida what's your question please\n[noise] fellow I read I was like oh I think you might call I wanted to ask the doctor if there's any reason just a research in genetics on genetic markers which could a social medicine approach to treating it possibly even preventing arthritis [noise]\nSo there's been a lot of research looking at genetic then that data goes back a good long way and I think the\nYou know probably the strongest a genetic marker that we know of are the class to antigens a chili DR antigens in\nThe pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis having said that\nUm as I mentioned earlier in the show the genes are such a small part of why we develop arthritis it's hard for me to imagine that engineering that on the front end it's going to make a big difference in the long run so you know we've been looking at genetics probably good data for a good twenty five years and I think that\nThat's unlikely to be you know I'm a cure if you will\nWell speaking of a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis you can turn on television and see a whole bunch of commercials for the disease modifying drugs or what we call the TANF Walker some of them human error being one of the classics\nAnd the most popular at the moment can you tell us a little bit about these drugs because they really have changed the game when it comes to rheumatoid arthritis\n[noise] absolutely and I think we're now in year twenty of the use of biologic demar it's the first one was ... and you mentioned a Adam ... and there are many many other one you know you said\nThe biologic demar it's the first one was the ... and you mentioned a Adam ... and there are many many other one now you said ... what does that stand for the Mars or disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs um and this is a unique class\nUm the biologic the march that target specific compounds that we think are important and uh the development of inflammation and in the case of these drugs are primarily targeting tea an effort to win a closest factor alpha\nAnd we know that TNN is an important a mediator of inflammation and pain in rheumatoid arthritis and these drugs have really revolutionized the way we treat rheumatoid arthritis\nNot only do the decrease pain and inflammation\nThey also prevent destruction of the joint and so\nYou know twenty five years ago it was not uncommon for folks with rheumatoid arthritis to develop significant amounts of joint damage really in a short period of time and now we know if we can identify patients early get them started on effective therapy we can prevent joint damage\nWhat's the first therapy you would use for rheumatoid arthritis [noise]\nSo the first therapy I use is education I think people need to understand what their diseases what makes it better what makes it worse and the kinds of therapies that are out there\nBut the first line the more that we often use this method ... which is not a biologic medicine it's an oral medicine or can be given by injection it's once a week and it has been shown to be very effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and we've known that really since the Nineteen eighties\nUm but that's a ... we are you know sort of first line in rheumatoid arthritis got to family members taking it my father for ... arthritis and my sister for her rheumatoid arthritis mhm absolutely\nThere are though many patients who don't respond to meth attract said alone so combination therapies are often used after that if it's not effective for the addition of these biologic therapies um after that\nNo when you watch TV you'd see the commercials and they warn you about the dangers infections and fungal infections and they even mentioned lymphoma if I'm not mistaken a kind of blood cancer so um\nHow dangerous are they are I think back to the days of of cortisone in the fifties and how we thought oh quarters or was this revolutionary drug for rheumatoid arthritis and ... and kind of bitterness and the bus\nAbsolutely but we now have Twenty years of good experience so um I think for certain the TANF inhibitors and other biologic drugs and there are other classes now\nCertainly increase the risk of infection and we worry about tuberculosis we worry about fungal infection and so vigilance about infections while you're on these drugs is very very important\nThat kids are story um is not altogether clear we know that patients with rheumatoid arthritis regardless of the ... of whether they've been on any of these medicines are at higher risk for lymphoma and leukemia so teasing out how much of this is the underlying disease and how much of the drug is unclear\nBut I have um you know a sense that the risk of cancer lymphoma leukemia solid cancers is actually not um significantly increased and there are now a lot of epidemiologic studies out there that are really supporting that but infection absolutely\nJoe emails to ask if women are more susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis they absolutely are two to three times more susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis than men are and not been clear for quite some time about ... ...\nThey absolutely are two to three times more susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis than men are and that's been clear for quite some time what about osteoarthritis or women more susceptible to that\nI think it's pretty even between men and women there may be times in the women's life so in the ... women go through a period where they're at higher risk um so during the life cycle men and women may have slightly different risks but I think overall um I think it's\nPretty back to the phones we go to end it got New York James welcome to the people's pharmacy\nHello hello James I'm I had a question of do a lot of patients in the treatment that I'm sixty six years old\nAnd in the late seventies they told me I'd lupus I was treated for lupus over a decade with high doses of brothers and", "show_name": "People's Pharmacy", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart",
