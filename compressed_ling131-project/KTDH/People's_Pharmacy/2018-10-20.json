are questions about how effective vitamin D supplements may be for preventing osteoporosis and fractures was to some research tell us\nComing up on the people pharmacy find out if calcium and vitamin D pills can keep your bones strong [noise]\nFirst this news\nIn the papal pharmacy help headlines a strange polio like illnesses spreading around the country at last count more than a hundred twenty

has identified the culprit\nThere is no treatment and no vaccine\nAlthough the CDC states that the condition is extremely rare the symptoms and consequences appear similar to polio as a result parents are getting worried by the increasing number of cases CDC will be issuing weekly updates\nThere had been rumors that term or it could be yellow spice and Cory might help protect people from dementia a placebo controlled studies suggest that there may be something to this idea\nResearchers at UCLA recruited older people with mild memory problems they randomly assigned these volunteers to take her

people have been told to take calcium pills to ward off ... or osteoporosis more recently they've been told they need vitamin D supplements as well\nJust as well to such supplements work a study published in jama at the end of two thousand Seventeen indicated they're not effective\nWhat to the experts think about this research to find out we turn to Dr Robert wrecker O'Brian professor of medicine and chief of the division of endocrinology I'd Creighton University school of medicine he directs the osteoporosis Research Center\nDr Robert cracker welcome to the people pharmacy\nProud to be with you\nDr wrecker you have studied bone and preventing osteoporosis for much of your professional career you are if I'm not mistaken endocrinologist by trade\nI tell a little bit about your perspective on vitamin D and calcium and other minerals we know that they're absolutely essential for bone strength but this study that was published in jama not too very long ago\nChallenged a lot of people's thinking especially with regard to dietary supplements like calcium and vitamin D it was a meta analysis they reviewed a number of randomized clinical trials and concluded\nThat taking supplements don't do anything to prevent fractures compared to placebo why do you challenge that\nWell\nBut ... don't do anything to prevent fractures compared to placebo why do you challenge that\nWell I tell us that are on the basis of first of all it's a meta analysis and I in general I have skepticism about them because they tend to be biased to the now and this particular study examined do very large number of meta analyses [noise]\nUh I Can't even remember the number but it was in the in the range of something like forty or fifty and they were hugely different in their study designs\nAnd so I I really don't accept it meta analyses are are a problem because uh the study designs are always different in a in the different studies that are included in in the case of nutritional studies it's particularly a problem\nBecause these studies are all double blind placebo controlled trials well that's the design that pharmaceutical companies use to test\nA drugs for four years and of advocacy and safety\nBut in the case of the pharmaceutical agent the placebo group has none of the pharmaceutical agent on board but on the case in the case of a nutritional supplements and everybody has some of the nutritional supplement in question on board\nOr they'd be disease you can make 'em disease\nTo note and right I mean to their diet in other words we're all getting calcium and we're getting some vitamin D either from sun or from food\nPeople who support public radio or lifelong learners who think globally and act locally they concerned themselves with news that

calcium pill or do you need to be drinking lots of milk what about vitamin D supplements how well do they work to prevent osteoporosis our\nGuest is Dr Walter Willett he's professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard th Chan School of public health\nAnd he's professor of medicine at Harvard Medical school his book is eat drink and be healthy the Harvard Medical school guide to healthy eating updated and expanded\nWelcome back to the people's pharmacy Dr Walter Willett it's so nice to have you back on our air\nOf thank you and good to be back with your\nDoctor will it or we saw a study a last year that was published in the journal of the American Medical Association which was a meta analysis\nOf thirty three clinical trials they looked at supplements of calcium and vitamin D and whether or not that kept people from breaking bones they concluded did not make any difference what's your take on this research place\nWell this area of calcium and vitamin D and bone health is a really a complicated area and ah I\nThink the Smith analysis and didn't really help us sort out the complexity and does far from a final answer on this topic\nAre there were several issues uh bought one very important issue is that the amount of vitamin D and the foreman which are the way in which vitamin D is administered can make a very big difference in results\nThat are just studied lumped together a randomized trials for vitamin D that cater to vitamin D in different ways including giving it and one injection for a whole year a very large amount or sometimes so once every month and a spouse\nIncluding giving it and one injection for a whole year of very large amount or sometimes once every month and especially when given once you're in very large I'm Out there is pretty strong evidence from a large trial\nThat actually can increase the risk of fractures that's of course very natural way of giving vitamin D traditionally record in the sun and get a little bit every day I Am much more sort of steady form of administration\nAnd that we don't totally understand why giving a huge amount all at once can be bad for you but there's some reasonable hypotheses why that could be a problem and the evidence suggests that it is\nIf you do look at the studies that gave a reasonable does more than the old idea of four hundred international units and gave it in a more constant way uh those uh do show some benefits of a vitamin team an appalling fracture risk [noise]\nAnother problem with is a limitation of this analysis was excluded studies that were done on institutionalized or individuals like people living in assisted living our nursing homes\nAnd um [noise] those ... their people to it's true that there are levels of vitamin D may be on average lower because he may not get out in the sun\nAs much but uh in those kinds of studies the closet study can actually be higher because you have a better chance of making sure people received their dose on a regular basis and some of the trials were included in that met in ... there was a ... large loss to participation or people are taking their vitamin D\nSo then and now she's become almost a plague basically that anybody with a guy who can connect with the Internet ah basically can do and I met in Alice ... send you the lead actress piling up with that analysis that I really think misleading [noise]\nA good bit of news is that there will be several quite large and I think pretty well done studies\nThat a lookout vitamin ... that will become they've finished already in fact a few months ago they're actively analyzing that data and so hopefully with the next year we'll have quite a bit more evidence on this important topic\nNow Dr we'll let you have\nBeen involved in literally hundreds of research studies over decades and a lot of your work has been in in the field of nutrition and I I've I've long wondered why it is\nThat some investigators think that they should treat nutrients like drugs and so you know you've mentioned these very large injectable doses of vitamin D fifty thousand a hundred thousand units and\nAnd then they ... they look in amazement when they go well that that wasn't helpful or maybe it was even counterproductive\nAnd you say well Mother Nature never intended us to get this gigantic amount of vitamin D all at once rather than the way it was supposed to be which is a small amount every day so why do you think they even designed those studies that way\n[noise] I had a good question I think maybe it's a little naive I'm at in some ways it's that I wouldn't criticize people too harshly for doing\nThose studies or just that they need to be very careful about the conclusions vitamin D is stored and if you could get the benefits from a single dose once a year that would be very nice\nBut I think the issue it turns out that that doesn't look like you're kind of there could actually be some harm but it's just if we'd generalize the findings from those kinds of very abnormal kind of\nTrials to conclude that vitamin D isn't in general beneficial ... that's the real problem\nKinds of very abnormal kind of trials to conclude that vitamin D isn't in general beneficial that through the that's the real problem\nThat you will let the other nutrients that was included in this meta analysis much calcium\nAnd you and we have talked about calcium supplements in the past but not all of our listeners have heard your idea it's about ... supplements help please tell us why should we all be taking calcium supplements to keep our bones strong\n[noise] ... another good question and again this is complicated because we know that vitamin or the calcium is absolutely essential that plays many functions including keeping our heart rhythm are orderly uh a is a critical\nPart of bone composition and so we have to get some calcium so\nThe issue is how much and we also know that like most essential nutrients if\nYou get too much you actually can cause harm so uh it's finding that sweet spot audits are a real game [noise]\nAnd the amount of calcium that we need our I think a ... not totally clear at this point in time but the way the amount of calcium requirement is set in the United states\nIs on the basis of very short term studies that last just two or three weeks basically looking at how much calcium can we sort of forced into the bone during a period of just a few weeks\nAnd that almost surely will give us a misleading answer because we know that you get some short term changes in bone density that do not reflect what happens in the long run that's very well established and so we have requirements that are set on these very short term studies\nAnd you get results saying we need a for over fifty twelve hundred milligrams a day\nWhich means almost for sure you need to be taking a couple of servings a day of dairy products to get up to that level whereas the world Health Organization has a step back and looked at the bigger global picture and they noticed what has actually been known for quite a few decades\nThat the countries that consume the most dairy and have the highest calcium and takes actually have the highest fracture it in the world that's northern Europe in the United states in countries that I Do not consume dairy\nAnd have a much lower calcium and takes the story of course are getting some calcium or they have the lowest ... so we I think we can't conclude from that kind of study that\nA calcium and ... causes fractures but it does say pretty clearly that we don't need to have these very high and takes a calcium and Jerry to ... to be able to have low rates of fractures\nUK looked at the evidence and they came up with seven hundred milligrams of calcium instead of the five hundred milligrams that the world Health Organization said was adequate far below the U. S.\nNumbers so whether we need five hundred seven hundred I think is uh that's probably closer to uh the correct answer not to twelve hundred milligrams and of course if we need seven hundred\nFor her

strong bones what supplements might you need to prevent osteoporosis or or supplements a waste of time and money\nOur guest is Dr Walter Willett professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T H Chan School of public health\nDr Willett is also professor of medicine at Harvard Medical school he's co author of eat drink and be healthy the Harvard Medical school guide to healthy eating updated and expand\nHe's co author of eat drink and be healthy the Harvard Medical school guy you healthy eating and expand\nDoctor will let you know the vitamin D story is so fascinating to me because\nThe epidemiology and you are\nSort of in some respects you know the father of epidemiology and the twenty first century I mean you've been you know guiding so many of your medical students and your colleagues in this field\nThe epidemiology suggests that vitamin D is essential for so many things and yet some of the randomized double blind placebo controlled trial suggests that just\nAdding vitamin D may not be producing the benefits that we expect and there are a bunch of studies that are in process right now so we'll have to wait to see the result\nBut is taking vitamin D doesn't lead to the outcomes that we would hope for\nWhat does this say about sort of the natural process of actually getting sun exposure to boost your vitamin D levels it'll drive the dermatologist crazy but is it possible that the supplements won't live up to expectations\n[noise] um get certainly possible that the ... do what we think they might do based on\nBlood levels that more of like a sunlight exposure\nBut there are major problems were randomized trials when it comes to studying nutrition and ... the supplies to some other areas as well but ah probably first and foremost that when we look at cancer this is a process that developed over many decades\nAnd most randomized trials go on for just three or four or five years\nAnd for looking at cancer cardiovascular disease\nOr that's just a little tiny window in a in a process that goes on for for many decades and it's easily possible that we will miss some benefits there and I just this one example that uh most of the randomized trials of not showing that vitamin supplements benefits cardiovascular\nDisease but ... and the physicians health study this was one study that went on for twelve years in a little bit longer for some people there was a significantly lower risk\nOf a total cancer incidence we're taking a multiple vitamin supplement in that study looking in that study for the headed only going on for eight years so that would not have been seen it was a modest benefit [noise]\nBut still an eight or ten percent reduction in total cancer incidence is actually pretty important and I would have been missed in every other study that's been done just simply on the basis of a not being long enough so I think many of the trials are now have\nA point of the problems is of course that and many of the trials even by four or five years\nMany people are not no longer taking supplements so you're really not testing the hypothesis that people get tired of it you need a lot of commitment and the physicians health study was people who are really very committed they were physicians you knew it long term studies were important and so that the long term study was possible\nAlso there's the issue that when we give a nutritional supplement\nUh it's not like a new drug where the people getting placebo are not getting any of that drug but\nIn the context of a nutritional study uh almost everybody's getting some of the nutrient that were testing and so many people already may have sufficient intake of that nutrient and adding more producers were ...\nMany people already may have sufficient intake of that nutrient and adding more producers ... no benefit if they already have enough but it may be that there's twenty or thirty percent or even ten percent who are not getting enough\nAnd would benefit for more and that would be missed and almost every study that's been done because there's not enough statistical power to pick up the benefits in a even a fairly substantial sums up [noise]\nSo all these problems have to ration of this study compliance are adherence to taking the supplement\nAnd then the fact that in the background many people are already getting enough of what's being tested the all those factors go together to make it really difficult to do is strong studies in giving a supplement a in a randomized trial context\nThat they will it it's clear that a cancer development in the long term prospects the development of heart disease can take place over many years osteoporosis is also something that doesn't happen overnight it it builds up gradually\nWe recently like yesterday I think got an email from a woman named Mary who said\nThat she um has been diagnosed with osteoporosis she broke her shoulder and that's what led them to their diagnosis she Seventy nine years old and vitamin D you level is sixty three she says I'm assuming she actually means or twenty five I jak see vitamin D\nAnd she says I Can't take the best spots in each that my doctor has prescribed they just make me sick what can I Do to improve my bones\n[noise] well it's really hard to be specific about any specific guys you're nickel situation of course in ... we'd want to know a lot more about a person or that low blood levels that's nana grams per a leader is pretty good light on the level\nAnd it's the team's probably unlikely that more vitamin D is going to be beneficial and of course calcium intake is a necessary one would want to know if a person is getting adequate calcium from their diet and if not at a modest supplement\nMight be good or changing a diet is another possibility and we're going to have some very a lot of evidence suggesting that yogurt is a pretty good for him to get the dairy\nSome of these drugs do have access to the end and can't be tolerated but I think when we're really need to look at the overall picture about one factor that is absolutely important in comes through in every study is that physical activity helps build up bones and reduce fracture risk it reduces fracture is\nBoth by reducing the risk of falling through improving muscle strength and also bones respond to the mile stresses of physical activity\nBy essentially getting stronger so the one thing that ah surely should be part of the package for everybody is to incorporate a physical activity\nAnd that but it's important to remember that it's really stressing the bones\nSo that are walking around or jogging or jumping will help your legs and help prevent hip fractures but that won't have the upper arms or the upper body and the arms so uh it's important just as we get older to include resistance training\nThat gives a little bit of a workout to all the bones in our body and you can do that with some rubber band kind of a simple exercises you don't need to even go to a gym to do that but with some but simple strength building as a as lots of benefits and a fracture reduction is truly one of those and often ignored\n[noise] but simple strength building as a as lots benefits and our fracture addiction is clearly one of those and often ignored\nYou pointed out that it's important to get enough calcium in your diet and you mentioned the benefits of yoga but\nWhat about people who don't tolerate milk even yogurt they may be lactose intolerant perhaps they're allergic there's there's quite a few of them now where else in the diet do they get their calcium\n[noise] we'd get calcium through a lot of different foods but for the green leafy vegetables are particularly\nGood source whole grains have a modest amount it with a diet that is what we think is sort of healthy Mediterranean diet with\nWhole grains fruits and vegetables or a a a maybe a little bit of cheese or yogurt or if you're a ... if you'd like to us intolerance you usually can have some chasing modest amounts\nWhich is an option but you can get quite a bit of calcium without any dairy products however if you're concerned a modest calcium does I think it's reasonable okay to supplement uh like five hundred milligrams", "show_name": "People's Pharmacy", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "20"}
