I think that um\nThere's a lot of confusion around hormones in general and testosterone in particular\nAre there for a while there were TV commercials that were sort of highlighting low testosterone levels low T I think is the way they refer to them and then the FDA got very excited and those those commercials seem to disappear pretty quickly the FDA basically said\nDoctors do not prescribe testosterone two men unless they have a real serious condition\nJust having low testosterone that doesn't count and they are all kinds of warnings about heart attacks and strokes and just all kinds of scary stuff around testosterone I Wonder if you have any thoughts about testosterone supplementation for men especially if they have low T\nAnd then Terry has a question about testosterone supplementation for women [noise] sure\nWell I think this is one of those situations where the pendulum swings toward testosterone and then away from it and in part I think that's in a context of one of the biggest study that was published on ... time for winning the women's health initiative\nSo let me talk about that for a moment then I'll come back to men because\nIn two thousand to about twenty three percent of American women were taking hormone therapy\nAnd then when the results came out that synthetic hormones ad studied in the wind and health initiative where dangerous and provocative much of the time it lead to millions of women stopping their Mormons and when you say well topping their hormones you mean stopping estrogen and ...\n[noise] that's right said synthetic versions so what would studied in women's health initiative ... and ... they're kind of I think of them as the devils we now\n[noise] that's right so synthetic versions so what would studied in the women's health initiative was primer and improve your other kind of I think of them as the doubles we know\nSo we went from twenty three percent taking hormones to five percent which I think it's too low I think we actually need to be somewhere in the middle but the other thing that this did sides scaring millions of women and getting them off their hormones is that it made the FDA\nSo sensitive and so fearful of recommending hormone therapy without long term randomized trials to support the use of it and so I think we are now living in a post women's health initiative era where\nWe don't have enough options we don't have enough\nConsensus around safe way to prescribe things like to toss run for men or even touch us run for women\nSo I think you know it's an unfortunate situation you know I'm not as current with the literature on low T and then and Andrew pause and you'd sort of took office or in therapy I certainly have patients who are on it\nUm and my sense is often that's comes down to a quality of life decision and I can tell you you know I'm not a fan of men\nFought seem themselves inexpensive testosterone that's never a good idea but for men who have a low level of testosterone and that's well documented and we're getting them back into the physiologic range\nI think there's a strong argument\nTo be made for that approach\n[noise] let me ask you about testosterone for women because the FDA has pretty much discouraged its use and yet my understanding is that for some women just really can make a difference for a low libido has\nThat been your experience and is there evidence that that's the case [noise]\nIs evidence so ... you know I can speak to you from the evidence and from what we know from the scientific literature and then I can also speak to you as a clinician on the front lines who prescribes testosterone for women\nAnd so in the first category you're right the FDA has really there is no FDA approved form of testosterone for women everything that's FDA approved as for men and sometimes we you know cut patches and\nDo other things to try to make it work for women but the dope or very high and stuff but it just doesn't translate\nAnd this is based on a few randomized trials one that stands out in my mind is one from the Massachusetts General hospital by ... where she showed that women after hysterectomy and after having their ovaries removed\nThat's you know the political situation where you're at your son Andrew testosterone goes down to a very low level in those women if you give them a tough job drum patch they end up having sex about one more per month compared to women not on the testosterone patch\nSo this study is what made the FDA turned down approval of the testosterone patch for women that's with maybe ten or Fifteen Years ago and we've really not had a lot of activity and since then [noise]\nNow the problem is just looking at how often you have intercourse isn't the best measure of a woman sexual experience and so this has been kind of authority tricky issue and clinically the way that I've dealt with it is to say to my patients\nYou know what we're going to do first since we're going to get your hormones back in the balance starting first with estrogen and protest Ronan cortisol and thyroid\nAnd I'm going to see where you are with your libido if you still have decreased will veto and I have ways that I measure that then we may want to consider adding on some\nYou do if you still have decreased will veto and I have ways that I measure that\nThen we may want to consider adding on some type of sauce room cream and I told them you know listen there's no FDA approved formulation for this so it means that we're basically involved in the ... an experiment here but I can also tell you after taking care of twenty five thousand patients\nThat I have a lot of patients who are on testosterone cream and say that it improves for their quality of life it improves their sex life it improves their connection with their partner\nSo that the potential risks are worth it so there are threats or things like liver function issues so I follow liver enzymes every uh six weeks to twelve weeks on my patients who are taking testosterone\nThere's also some very limited data that there may be a small increase risk of breast cancers that we do everything we can from\nGenomic testing to buy a marker testing to reduce that risk of breast cancer as low as possible but those are some of the risks and it ends up being a quality of life decision that we renegotiate every three to six months when I see them in office\n[noise] there there may be some very specific situations where you would say well probably you don't want to take this risk or are you sure you really want to take the threats for example someone who is making her living as a singer\nI'm might not want to risk the possibility that testosterone would change her vocal Tambor [noise]\nThat's right I mean the votes the voice low arena fact it's one of those risks that as part of informed consent with testosterone therapy [noise]\nBut I can also tell you that with my patients I'm so careful to make sure that we're in the middle of this it's the electric range into side effects related to um what I Would call ... symptoms so that's total medical language let me translate it for you\nSo for patients who have a voice florine effect that tends to be when you're a super physiologic so you have levels of testosterone that are beyond the normal range\nAnother um sign of having too much testosterone it's increased sides of the ... so you know we're watching for those things it's part of the informed consent but if you have a patient who's within that physiologic range the chance to that at very low\n[noise] that the Godfrey a lot of women are aware that they may experience some changes in sexual function around men upon us\nBut I think that most people have an idea that once you're past menopause you're not interested in sex anymore that's really not a reasonable assumption is it [noise] well\nIt's such a personal decision I Believe and I you know I'm careful not to take my own values and my own attitude about sex and projected onto my patients\nWhen I decided I was going to do with that throwing was here and I was like on the door right now and I literally just shake my head against edition Saturday from NPR News Saturday morning at seven central [noise]\n\nWent back to the people pharmacy I'm Terry ...\nTo purchase a CD of today show or any people's pharmacy

health issues particularly with regard to sexuality we're talking about political problems that may not be suitable for young listeners many medications can interfere with libido and sexual satisfaction or people warned about such side effects when they get a prescription\nOur guest is Dr Sara got fried she's a board certified gynecologist with more than twenty five years of experience her books include the hormone cure the hormone reset diet and younger\n[noise] doctor Godfrey ... you mentioned that when you went to your family physician with some of the problems that you're experiencing the answer was an anti depressant and you also mentioned that some of your patients come in with mood disorders\nThe answer was an antidepressant and you also mentioned that some of your patients come in with mood disorders and I suspect that a lot of health care professionals would prescribe an anti depressant for someone who complained of feeling down in the dumps\nThe only trouble with those drugs that they have a fairly high rate\nOf sexual dysfunction\nA four men it may be an inability to achieve orgasm but that may be true for women as well and it may also lower libido so can you give us a your perspective\nOn many of the medications that are prescribed that have this perhaps unexpected and on disgust me this is not something a lot of health professionals like to talk about oh I'm I'm prescribing you Prozac and by the way it might ruin your love life how do you do with that\n[noise]\nI Love this question so I you know I I think if you look at\nThe most unbiased data on antidepressants and their role in depression which you find is that they're often worse than placebo in terms of effective nuts for mild to moderate depression for severe depression I think they you can make an argument to prescribe but\nThe majority of patients that icy have mild to moderate depression\nAnd I think they have no business being prescribed in anti depressant I think they ... they need lifestyle medicine they need treatments that are designed to help them with the level of inflammation in their body which is at the root of why they feel depressed\nSo you know we we live in an era with a broken healthcare system if I'd step back for a moment and I know because I trained within it so I'm trained as a traditional physician and it's a it's an era of the pill for every hill\nAnd I think we found that this strategy has failed we need a different strategy we know that about Seventy percent of health care costs are lifestyle related\nAnd I think the mood is a really good example\nSo if we just if we look at the hormonal drivers the mood for a moment we know that about fifty percent of people who are depressed have high cortisol levels it's at being checked by every primary care doctor who sees the patient who complains of depression no we know that about twenty percent\nOf patients with depression have a lower thyroid a function and that is it a little more often but you know I I think it's\nTo me it's crucial to do a root cause now so that's when you have a patient with the mood issue and to look at what I consider and women at least to be the hormonal Charlie's Angels to look at cortisol to look at thyroid and to look at ... and\nSo for so many women will for all with an upsurge in it's a master regulator and when you start to make lots of it beginning in your forties sometimes in your fifties it can cause mood issues and so to me the first treatment should be to get those hormones back in the balance not to reach for the Prozac or some other anti depressant\nSo you're right I mean I Wish that every patient was given full informed consent about the adverse risks of being prescribed antidepressants I think we\nUnfortunately do live in a time where the average appointment with a a doctor in the U.S at seven minutes and it's often faster and quicker to\nPrescribe the Prozac or whatever ... whatever the new anti depressant is rather than to really get to the root cause\nI'm suspecting that you have a number of patients who have come in your office and after you get done talking with them and the bench surely they say well you I Am having some libido issues and\nHave a number of patients who have come in your office\nAnd after you get done talking with him and eventually they say well you I Am having some libido issues and and sexism like it used to be\nYou find out the yeah they're taking some ball to or they're taking so Alexa or they're taking Alexa pro or filling the blank there were a dozen of them and millions or tens of millions of people are relying on these medications on a daily basis whether\nThey're helpful or not how do you how do you interact with a patient who is complaining of sexual dysfunction but has been on an antidepressant for months or years\n[noise] well we know we know from the best statistics that went in for American women over the age of forty has taken anti depressant and that's the number is ... double in my practice so about half my patients come in taking antidepressants so what I Do is\nI'm not someone who immediately removed every pharmaceutical that a patient is taking I don't think that serves some well\nBut what we want to do is take a look at OK what's happening with your body right now what's working well what ... what some of the intelligent design that we can enhance\nWhat's happening with your hormones and could we start to naturally balance those hormones and once you start feeling better start to withdraw the anti depressant so there's some antidepressants so she can stop and not have dramatic withdrawal symptoms from\nThere are others where that's far less the case such as like the pro and so I have a strategy that I use with balancing hormones and also you know not just the Mormons but what's happening in terms of your nutrients are you eating the foods that support a good mood\nAre you getting the exercise that you need which I think it's one of the best forms of anti depressant\nI think of it not as you know some it's good for your heart but it's also incredibly good for your mood you know what about your connection with others argued socially isolated purpose and meaning\nSo it's to me it's a much broader context from which to discuss whether someone should continue taking antidepressants and similar to what I said about taking hormones it's not a yes no answer it's more okay\nYou've been taking the symbol to for ten years how do you feel on it what were you like before have you gained weight\nWhat can we do to support you better what are your goals do you want to get off of it you know not just going to project my own view about anti depressant on to all of my patients so that gives you a little flavor I Hope of how I approach this in my practice\nSlowly on ... you have mentioned rude cause analysis so I'm guessing that all of these things go into your red cause analysis [noise]\nYes definitely you know I I started with food [laughter] and it's\nI feel like food as such important information for your body I don't think of it as calories I don't think of it is you know fuel I think of it as information for your DNA tell us more about that if you would please sure [noise]\nWell you know I think if you look at\nAn ancestral health perspective we had a certain way of eating and our paleolithic times that was a good match for DNA and what's happened in the past especially one hundred years is that the way that we've eaten has dramatically completely changed\nNow that's also along with the change that we talked about earlier with stress with high perceived stress and the two kind of are in lockstep\nSo I'm a big fan of starting first with someone's diet and that does\nAnd the two kind of are in lockstep\nSo I'm a big fan of starting first what someone's diet and that doesn't ... it doesn't matter whether they're coming Sunni because of decreased would veto or they're coming to see me because they want to reduce the risk of breast cancer or\nUm they're having menopausal symptoms and can't sleep at night it doesn't really matter what the chief complaint is what matters is\nYou know that's kind of system speech analysis starting first with food so I Want to know where your nutrients coming from when are you eating what are you eating whom are you eating
