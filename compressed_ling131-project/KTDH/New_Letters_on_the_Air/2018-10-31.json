especially one on the early ... made a deal that will be trying to figure out people things they do\nOne reason why because something happened and if they're just really sad that are out and walk\nAway in the middle of the snow storms so everybody turned out to search for\nThe child in the eastern several\nDays later she had actually killed the children to read it in the snow or how does that how how do you have to kill the shoulder\nThroughout history is happening with human behavior but they don't quite understand in that sort of fictional arena I can get a little further towards others\nAnd more on the writing life has your down and stay on ladders on their production of letters magazine University of Missouri Kansas\nCity and I talked to the Olympic all their while he was Calvin Seventeen cocker fair share of writer in residence for un Casey creative writing program only all gather for the interview Kansas City public librarian\nHere Vernon tired\nOf rain here and everybody was reading his book the thing the second Harry and one of the two bucks she added um reader coverage lumber I ended up getting them every day if you haven't seen\nIt out for a long time on because\nI cannot Brian ... is a whole lot of Tim O'Brien everyone if you haven't seen as been out for Twenty years long time but\nIt's amazing because you have fiction poetry you have the ladders\n... songs yeah everything I Want to sort of the big coverage but of course it's just the American side of the American war in Vietnam it's not the Vietnamese war yeah on there and you're looking at a lot at\nThe soldier how they're portrayed during the war and after the war and then you're covering and in ways which is also interesting yeah you're a second way yeah they definitely\nWere specific ways and then they kind of Abd there after about Nineteen eighty six or eighty seven there after ... jacket it kind of just sort of falls downhill a little bit\nBut you need to be like oh Bryan lighten up a little bit yeah extra shades and throwing some near as they're making strange make an odd which he does provide that lift now that list of going after college she auto that lift of that wonderful story at speaking of courage\nWhen he was here it was the most amazing reading that he did it wasn't particularly light but he was very\nVery strong has been touring with the book since Nineteen Ninety I Know you know when he was like a writer's held in a way it looks like you know play the hatch we want to hear their head but obviously it's changed the way that a certain generation sees Vietnam because that's their introduction\nLet's talk a little bit about your background because you're a first degree was an aerospace engineering and you actually worked as an engineer\nYeah reality for all your very mediocre I was a very mediocre engineer now why do you say\nThat what makes a mediocre engineer I wasn't\nInterested enough and I was fascinated by it and I think I was fascinated already by reading and trying to learn how to write so I Would come home from work and I was in test engineering and when he was busy I didn't have time to do anything but when it was sort of slack I'd spend no some mornings sitting in the bathroom\nReading war and peace or I'd be downstairs you know at the test desk pretending to take care of things just reading ... for\nFlow bear and listening to new letters on the air on tape when I was commuting home from work and keeping my manuscripts with me so they could work on them whenever I can steal in it so it was already stealing time for my family and I was stealing time from work I was killing time from everything just so that I could write I just had to do it and there was no reason\nLike when I was a kid I didn't want to be a writer I never wrote\nBut you were being read or write always a\nBig reader yeah big big rear love comic books and ... in a horror an adventure but all of a sudden I just started writing in my early twenties and it kind of took over everything\nI mean her will states the new one is going to make a movie of this so I figured out just do it and have fun with it it's a way of inhabiting the books I mean down to the dialogue and scenes and the gestures with the character's make and to try to make it a little stronger I guess the ... by John Agar weidman\nIf you've ever read it it's one of his early novels in which these for black men decide they're going to Lynch a white cop just on principle there and they never sort of get to it and not to give it away\nBut the arguments that they have why we should do this or why we shouldn't do this and how it sort of terrorists them apart as friends as a fascinating book and so I should have wrote\nA screenplay based on that but taking it even step further wow why gunman in city from Pittsburgh and he is he's one of the great great Pittsburgh writers right yeah but he was living in France [laughter] I'm we're way fancier\nBut you were born in Pittsburgh and are still they're\nBorn and raised in the eye boomerang way for Thirty years but came back there and everyone still there and my family is all there I'm the only one that ever left which again is very typical uh Pittsburgh\nThat fascinates faith that you write screenplays talk about being in conversation with a writer that really is taking it to a different degree do show 'em to anybody sure\nI'll send them to the writers I rode one of Dennis Johnson's first novel angels and I had him read it and then I met him later on he was talking about it and\nIt's like this is cool Dennis Johnson talking about angels heat actually written a screenplay of angels and sold at the Hollywood they never made the movie so they just shoved in the drawer and it's never been seen yeah but I got it happens with a lot\nOf hope tons I mean Hollywood so goofy but I just had fun writing them and they don't take very long to write it may take you know three weeks four weeks and to go through a book like the violent beret away and say\nWhat do I have to show to the viewer to really get them to understand is very very odd story it's a lot of fun\nIt's great exercise for you as a writer to talk about learning from them as well and again I Would imagine getting a little deeper into the books and [noise] Stewart\nOn man and this is new letters on the air and the Kansas City public library as he is the cocker fair chair writer in residence at U. of M. K. C. N. N. since we're talking about screenplays that might be a good shift into not here\nThe chair writer in residence at U. of M. K. C.\nN. N. since we're talking about screenplays that might be a good shift into not your most recent book but your book right before that west of sunset looking at F Scott Fitzgerald during his Hollywood ... ears and he's trying his\nHand screenplay writing out in Hollywood do you want to talk a little bit about that book yeah I'm going to have you read from it\nI Love so yeah I it was fascinating to me because in the biographies of Fitzgerald they give it sort of short shrift and they can't set the scenes as fully\nAs I'd like them to be he lived at the garden of Allah at the same time the Dorothy Parker and Allen Campbell live there and Humphrey Bogart and mail mess thought his second wife at the time and his girlfriend there and all these other people Ogden Nash lived there and Robert bench ally and a Donald Ogden sewers so he had\nFriends there and he comes from the east he was broke Zelda was in the asylum\nIn North Carolina he was drinking he wasn't really writing much fiction at all I mean he'd failed in life he had failed at this point and this was going to be his last stop to come out in Hollywood and try to make it and this is his third time out there he failed twice there before so this time he goes out\nAnd he has to get out of debt because he owes Harold over his age and something like thirty thousand dollars in Depression era value there\nAnd he's been promising him a novel and\nAllowing promising Rio's max and now he owes them and um yeah and so when he runs out of money when he does is lined up hawking his car to just keep going so he's got very little margin for error here and it goes out there and he tries to redeem himself the only way he knows how which is\nTo work and work and work and he goes out there and he falls in love and he works at MGM at the same time on the same hallway we're Dorothy Parker eldest Huxley and James them again you know and then this new kid Fitzgerald who doesn't know what the hell he is doing\nThere so he goes there are a total failure and he's surrounded by people who are at are about to have the pinnacle of success Dorothy Parker and Allen Campbell just won the Oscar for a star is born Humphrey Bogart is getting greater Houston is about to come this iconic guy and out is actually has just won an Oscar\nFor pride and prejudice you know in MGM is the prestige studio so he's on the lot while they're making the wizard of Oz she works actually on gone with the wind which I didn't know when I started writing the book and I found that out actually works for two weeks with David those cells Nick who's popping amphetamines\nAnd staying up all night and just going through writers so seem fascinating to me this very broken down romantic figure in one of the most romantic eras romantic places in American history surrounded by\nThe depression his depression the alcoholism in\nThe midst of the old is he ends up having to go back to do these weird vacations with Zelda that her doctor has prescribed and he prescribed them go ...\nMostly will be for the rest of her life but the doctor thinks it's good to acclimate her self to the outside world so she sends Zelda and Scott and their daughter ... off on news week long vacations to places like Myrtle Beach or Virginia Beach or Miami or Cuba\nBecause she's an try on North Carolina or hinders yeah somewhere near ... south of ... just\nOutside of Asheville there at highland hospital Soviets in North Carolina area on on vacations that they picked himself up from his writing in from his romance thing of Sheila Graham his new love and goes back east and it always turns out badly and then he he always sort of goes back on the bottle then and it goes back and\nSays she helped me and after a while she was like I don't want to deal with this so we asked us to pick themself up all over again and meanwhile he's working and\nGoes back on the bottle then and it goes back and says she helped me and after a while she was like yeah I don't want to deal with this so we asked us to pick themself up all over again and meanwhile he's working and working and working and smoking and taking pills and the terrible health and\nIn the biographies they can't put you there and they can't put you with the garden of Allah during the\nParties they can't show him talking to Hemingway when Hemingway comes to town and he's the host of the town and Scott has like nothing there and I one of those scenes I wanted to feel what does it feel like to be him going through this and that's always the question for me in writing fiction has it feel to be you and\nLuckily with Fitzgerald is lots of evidence there now there's books\nThere's the letters there's other people's biographies and views of him so I could get a rounded view of Fitzgerald and work with them so it was very much more editorial in deciding what needs to go in the book to understand who he is and what I consider them\nAnd what you might take given the taste of a sudden [noise]\nOpen up with the first section which is chimney rock and doesn't even have set up at the EPA grass or the book are\nThere are no second acts in American lives and a lot of people think that this is actually from the last tycoon but it's not it's an earlier essay called my last city in which she thinks\nAbout how he's lost that early success and they wrote this in Nineteen thirty two and how also America has lost that success having crashed in Nineteen twenty nine\nThis is the second half a graphics from crazy Sunday has short story about Hollywood nothing was impossible everything
