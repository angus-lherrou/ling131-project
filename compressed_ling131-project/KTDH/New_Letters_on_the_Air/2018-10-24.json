and raised in DC\nBecame so integrated into the Appalachian culture here's Ted Olson\nWashington DC was the site of a lot of ex pats out migrants from Appalachia who you know they weren't leaving I pledged for political reasons per se but for economic reasons people seeking work in the big city so in the sixties and seventies when\nI was living there Washington had a kind of an underground Appalachian culture you would hear the musicians you would meet the folks at various activities the Smithsonian would have this folk festival and I attended regularly met some Appalachian musicians and other\nCreative types artisans and such\nWho carried the Appalachian east coast and they would share these stories and these songs with me as a open I kid and of course that's when my awareness came that there was this place largely rural very close to DC and it kind of opened my eyes that\nThe realities that I was seeing around me the politics and the racial strife of DC\nWas one story one narrative but that there was much more out there and I started to as soon as I could\nMake a forays into the mountains you know as a teenager camping and\nBackpacking and hitchhiking it was a counter narrative to life's possibilities and as I befriended people from Appalachian my visits there I just felt called there to work and to serve the function of cultural intermediary\nWell the thing that I find remarkable is that neither you nor Jane still were from Appalachia originally and yet you both for so grounded\nJames still certainly was a similar sort of story came to\n... to kind of find himself I mean originally I think it was to find work but he ultimately found his voice there and became one of the great writers of Appalachia and I was very honored to work with them at the end of his life helping to coal late and edited his collected poems and\nAfter his death about Fifteen Years ago I continued to work on his papers producing a\nCollected short stories volume that was in some ways the deepest level of engagement\nAbout Fifteen Years ago I continue to work on his papers producing a collective short stories volume that was in some ways the deepest level of engagement that I had with his work was ironically after he passed I was a challenge to\nCoordinate all his masterful short stories into a single volume and that was a very complex process that took several years anyway\nYou know I read what you wrote about that it took a lot of detective work to figure out which was the newest version of short stories and then also there's some short stories that were included and went to his famous novels James still was endlessly tinkering with his work and all writers\nTo of course because all writers are crafts folk who really want the best possible way to convey a thought a feeling an idea James still had multiple versions of every short story and I had to determine what was the final intended version and\nThere had been some editorial manipulation\nOf his work by others over the years and that\nWas another factor and then you mentioned his grade novel river of earth and get incorporated a number of short stories into that novel the original short story versions in most cases were different from the versions in the novel and so we had to kind of go back to the original for those and it\nSeemed to me that the original versions of the short stories worked\nPerfectly separated from the novel even though they worked beautifully within the novels contacts so it was an interesting activity for sure\nYeah the book is called the hills remember the complete short stories and James still it's a beautiful book I Love the cover did the work well I've\nLocated this particular painting at a gallery in Asheville North Carolina by will Henry Stevens who's an acclaimed Depression era painter her sat\nOn the south and he didn't romanticize Appalachian I think that was important for me when representing James stills work James stills pros is very political his poetry\nIs very much like song invalid trades for traditional and its tone will Henry Stevens I think had that same essence he kind of captured the poetry of Appalachia the culture in the landscape\nAnd so it was a perfect fit that will Henry Stevens and James still\nYeah it really is a perfect fat well you mentioned has poetic voice I noticed that there are a couple of poems\nFrom New letters magazine that he published years ago I thought you'd be interested in actually\nSeeing the magazine itself it's\nFrom Nineteen eighty four eighty five and he was published in here with Robert Bly Hayden cruise Raymond Carver aren't Richard Rhodes\nBut I thought I might get you to read these two pollen step back to back in here and they also appear in his new and collected poems that was the first book that you worked with James still\nOn called from the mountain from the valley\nWhat have you heard lately\nWhat have you heard lately from sulfur ... nothing huh nothing

eighty four why do you have you heard lately imagining to learn both of those poems are in James stills and collection from the mountains from the valley new and collected poems that more\nEdited by Ted Olson who is here with me today and this is new letters on the air isn't that interesting juxtaposition his poem that has more of the feel of the every day man and then madly to learn just takes us into the world of literature and across the globe\nFor those who expect to all of James stills literary creations to focus on Appalachia I mean this is kind of suggests otherwise that he had a very active intellectual life while he stayed in Appalachia for seven decades arriving they're fully\nBloomed in his adulthood but lived a very long time he traveled a great deal red voluminous Lee and was really quite an intellectual and these bones reflect that you've got to tell the story about when you first met him because you were just a college student right\nAt the University of Kentucky where I was a graduate student UK had sponsored I Believe it would have been a fiftieth anniversary celebration of the publication of river of earth James stills Great Depression era novel and\nBodies of work I'm looking at one right here in front of me on top of old Smokey new old time Smoky Mountains music there's several other collections that you've done as well talk about that part of your life\nSure I've been playing music three quarters of my life and pretty early on it was clear that the repertory that I wanted to learn and that I wanted to share with others was the Appalachian music heritage the ballads to folk songs to folk tunes\nAnd the stories behind the music\nAnd so I started to play music in West Virginia when I was working at a camp there how old were you I Would point Eighteen Nineteen okay so that was the point at which I first started to take the lessons I learned from records and from books and from the people I had met\nAt the Smithsonian annual festival and take the music back to people and the people I\nPlayed the music for in West Virginia where\nCampers at a summer camp\nFrom Washington D. C. that was one audience but the other audience which was in some ways more daunting\nWas to play that music back for the locals near the camp where I work inside the friend did a number of West Virginians who thought it was maybe a little bit odd that this teenager was so interested in maybe a traditional music that originated from that same part of the world and yet they\nWere very supportive of it and I developed to do well I suppose you would say with a gentleman who was from West Virginia named Jack ... who was a tremendously talented guitar player and since I played the banjo [noise] it was a natural combination and we played together for several years around West Virginia\nAnd it was just a wonderful immersion experience for me and after working at the summer camp and getting that formative experience with music and learning the stories behind the music I took the experience is to the national Park Service\nWorking as a park ranger as an interpreter of Appalachian cultural and natural history I felt that the next step\nAfter playing kind of as an interpreter\nWas to take a deep dive into the scholarly history of Appalachian and so then I went back to graduate school and got a degree in literature but my dissertation was a focus on\nWent back to graduate school and got a degree in literature\nBut my dissertation was a focus on Appalachian folklore and folk life and so that just was a springboard into during the work that I Do now which is kind of a holistic study of Appalachian culture and what I Try to do is to put my awareness I have gained about Appalachian values I Try to\nAgain service it kind of intermediary as an interpreter between this knowledge and the broader world and in addition to literary endeavors I've also been involved with musical endeavors taking the songs ballads and tunes of many\nPeople of Appalachia to the world and some of the projects I've done it in fact been more widely received far beyond Appalachian I mean I've\nDone a number of box sets of Appalachian music for a German company bear family records that had been reviewed all over the world so\nIt's been very gratifying to spin and of course the challenge to recover stories that have been long lost a lot of the music that I work on his music from the twenties and thirties and that sort of thing one box at that I worked on the Bristol sessions brought back\nFamous recording sessions that launched country music but a lot of the stories behind them people knew the records by the Carter family and Jimmy Rogers but they didn't really know the larger context until working with some colleagues we kinda brought the stories out and certainly reintroduce the music to people\nYou've been out for several Grammys in the production of your work I think six maybe\nI've been very blessed with that degree of reception for the sets that I've released the nominations had been for best historical album and also for best liner notes or album notes they call them\nAnd so basically those are craft awards and ... you know continue to work at it and one has to do these projects for love of the music love of the stories behind the music love of the culture that produce the music and the story\nBut the acknowledgement is of course very gratifying and I think it does help to bring the work to a broader audience\nYeah I think it does to do you do songwriting at all\nYou know I've never really pursued songwriting in some ways songwriting is a good deal more lucrative if one is worried about such things than writing poems I've written a few songs I suppose you know of course they have to be matched carefully to melody in court structure\nBut I've always kind of kept my interest in music and poetry separate which is a curious thing I've not out of\nThe curious thing well maybe that's a head one thing I have thought\nIs that I feel as if the kinds of stories the kinds of exploration that I seek to do in a poem I've never found a way to\nGo that deeply into those experiences in song form I mean I've tried a few times I Do feel that sometimes poems can go to places that songs can't go I really want to acknowledge that I mean\nPoems to be memorable this sort of thing you have to have elements of musicality you know sound and read them and these sorts of things but while I appreciate the great songwriters like anyone who loves great cultural expression I feel that ... can go to a place that songs can go\nKnow I Can't get over how\nDovetailed everything is in your life you know you've got this work of other people's\nThat James still Appalachian writer then you've got Appalachian music and you've worked for the Smoky Mountains and I know that you've written some stuff from the Smoky Mountains trails guidebook so you must be a big hiker right I Can't imagine living anywhere by the Appalachians now I mean it's so much a part of you\nSo you must be a big hiker right I Can't imagine living anywhere but the Appalachians now I mean it's so much a part of you\nBut the interesting thing for me is that a deep immersion into the realities is a place where you live helps one to feel at home outside where one lives it's an interesting irony that I feel better situated to live in the world maybe anywhere because\nI Know what it means to live in one place\nYou know in your earlier book breathing in darkness you have a poem that refers to the blue Ridge Mountains and it's called swallows I thought I might get you to read that\nThis is one of the earliest poems in this collection it's linking back to what we were talking about what's window very encouraging me to have kind of a sharper sense of craft the original draft of this from perhaps Nineteen eighty was just sitting in a notebook somewhere\nSo I went back to this poem after taking window berries class and thinking about some of his lessons taught to us so this poem is basically a recast version of an older one and put together in the early Nineteen nineties but based on an earlier experience of immersion in the blue Ridge Mountains as a very young person\nSwallows\nAlone in this valley of a thousand mountains the blue Ridge Mountains by the Shenandoah River I'm walking watching water meander over the old rocks washed them away\nLimestone mostly some sandstone in shale dissolving\nOutside the framed farmhouse I pause knowing no one is home this late September evening I shall step back in my boots worn like the door screen I stumble my grace lives feet trampling the floorboards into dust\nNow I trespass in the place of swallows\nThey swoop for my eyes and so I cower where once I crawled I recall seeing swallows then\nBut then they lived in cavities in banks entries not in our house and yet I'm not surprised to find them hiding here from me might can stole flight from them\nAnd one's for fun I flung stones at them but missed it only my window\nI Can't look back now can't see my path as one dissolving in
