me today is that in my hotel I looked at my window and I saw bookstore sauce I [noise]\nAn independent bookstore and then I looked and ride around the corner that was another book store [noise]\nThat's crazy [noise]\nThey used to be normal but it's not any more so I was like okay good I wasn't sure about Kansas\nBut [noise] got books or so you're doing something right [noise] I just actually have how to be drawn\nUp here and what I Will tell you is I really only care about like the last\nThing I wrote by the time the book is out there um mostly just thinking about a few new things that I Need to try\nOut so that means that can be terrible\nBut I Am always trying to work towards though so that does kind of inform what I read I was thinking about a few things that I should read just to kinda see what transition I can make of what I'm doing now which is always a little bit different than what is in the books are what you might expect if you've read the books I saw some science and I'd be funny then I\nJust haven't been feeling funny for like the last ten days or so [noise]\nYou know I'd like to have any humorous pollens I Do usually this is the first call\nAnd then there's some weird stuff in the basement like King Lear stuff that I Would never say but I'm doing that because I'm working my way towards some sonnet so there's a little Shakespeare for you but there's also some oh the obese I don't know if the same people who know oldie be you're going to know that I was alluding to King Lear\nThe first call what it looked like dear old dirty bastard I too like in raw I don't especially care for Duke Ellington at a birthday party\nI care less and less about the shapes of shapes because forms change and nothing is more durable than feeling\nMy uncle used the money I gave him to buy a few vials of what looked like candy after the party where my grandma sang and an outfit that was obviously made for a West African king\nMy motto is never mistake what it

the king and that's okay no one will tell you you were the king no one really wants to king anyway\nSo that's sort of in the middle of what I could do like there's some weird stuff in there but then you know the grandmother for people who like pulling should have grandmothers and um [noise] they'll get the king Lear rent if you've got a college degree in English you should know [noise] okay okay so that's the first one\nA lot of the poems have a shadow of like experience and then just allowing for that we're all going to be\nAs open as it can be even if it's sometimes a shadow of a real world of the\nThreat of history you know is there and I thought I was with the first time like I might not say that the horse reference to the king though one wants to king you know is King Lear or maybe you don't know who Tang Clan and maybe I like it raw you might not know any of that but it's the pieces of things like a ... you're not going to wear all the parts of the cook from\nTo make a quilt so that's usually how I think about the world [laughter] that's how the whatever the guy counter\nSo I can take like a little something and then it will become a poem but this one this actually happened
