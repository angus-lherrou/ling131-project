I graduated with my MSA last year and for the Evan Bayh process part of the thesis is a creative manuscript this book is the combination of that two years\nI was halfway through my MSA\nHalfway through with the new creative project and was going to be a book that had no title and one of my astonishing professors a poet named ... who told us in the end if a program that we have to attack the manuscript\nOn the wall as we're working on the new book and then put revisions of that poem on top of it so that you can go back and look at the earlier version of the problem you can see the poem growing death and the book grow in length and depth as well on your wall and I was halfway through my him if a program and\nI had about forty pages of my manuscript I was about halfway through my manuscript on my wall\nAnd I liked a lot of the poems very much and I wasn't crazy about a lot of the poems very much I thought it had it a little bit of promise but it was still a work in progress

slurred speech and an intimate way posturing and over grazing it is uncertain how long the recovery period will last\nWe should have known something wild and non native would refuse to take root in
