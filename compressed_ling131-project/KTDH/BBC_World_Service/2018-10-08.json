back\n\n\nAlive\n\nIn last week's program climate soldiers Michael Mann explains a several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his models were suggesting we think there's something wrong with a comma\nLet me issue a mayor culpa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly inactive Atlantic hurricane season and that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic into tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen those temperatures were not unusually warm\nWe were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event did it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the\nFormation of these storms so for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but\nAt woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic that warm\nIs what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened even before Florence made landfall\n... rage with scale full wins the Atlantic clinics But Kevin read of Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in the forecast simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there were demoted to petition overland after impact of the dorm with fifty percent increase due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description outside from friday also which is as a great so long can you heard of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving ... the amount that the strengths of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of a vent to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it make landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... and you can pin down Pacific Ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate\nIn the north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it make landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the natural beauty and you can pin down the Pacific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that an estimated at part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and warmer areas and cooler area but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initial education so that when we run lead modify forecasts without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the ... temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that there had on the atmosphere temperature as well as their temperature changes that have a choice during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... vets are associated with the greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for it but we're not just doing a uniform a change in the ... the we actually have a pattern change of the empty that come from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned it's something that has actually included in the set up\nThese patents have geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic a\nLarge part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to\nForm a tropical storm we think that somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there is a very large region in the Atlantic the sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms and that as\nThe Atlantic warms up with global warming that region where temperatures are high enough to\nForm those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanded quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier we're seeing\nStorms turned into major hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well is marginal changes\nTo the Atlantic look potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many events that have mocked the past few months\nSea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most some of those and recovering more poorly each winter Julian streets were of the
