there's a lot of plastic inside the cabins or airplanes that may never get re is is that single use and what will it be replaced by you know metal of some kind\nAlso it takes resources to make that metal just like a dust plastic and takes energy and it's heavier as a consequence that may cause the airplane and get less gas mileage so to speak and have a bigger carbon footprint\nSo those people who carry around the mental knife and fork in that bag when they go to work so they don't have to use a plastic one that doing the wrong thing or they\nOh I don't think so I don't think that's quite the same thing I think avoiding the use of disposable plastic there's not a bad thing to do however I don't know that just banning it out right across the board is necessarily going to achieve the most desirable result\nWhile it's not out try it it it's just in the European Union and surely that's a good don't\nKnow it's outright inside the European Union what I'm saying is that\nAlternatives we'll have to be found for example if you don't use a plastic bottle then you'll have to use a glass bottle how much energy goes into the use of that glass bottle how much energy goes into either recycling into just throw you in the landfill one has to consider what the alternative is for each use of a single use plastic\nI thought the whole point was that they were single ... plastics and a glass buffalo you can take back the shopping refill and using many times if you want to tell them I mean that in the perceived wisdom surely\nWell not necessarily I haven't seen many return of bottles in the United states at about twenty five years well there are a lot modem in Europe I can tell you well that's fine they're also costs money to scrape those bottles up and use them again it's not the single use plastic should be used\nIt's not that getting rid of them isn't a good thing but you have to be careful about being sweeping\nI'm just curious as to what the alternatives to sweet thing is I mean if if you introduced legislation to ban single use plastic says it all depends on where to death and they did a good thing or is it no it's in your opinion\nI don't think it's a good thing to have a sweeping ban\nShould such measures they expanded so that it becomes written into global trade deals that\nWell as in not just for the European Union then it's certainly not good for the world I Would like to see fewer single use plastic out there right I Would feel the ... plastic forks or are going into restaurants and being handed Styrofoam cups and things of this nature\nHowever one wants has to be judicious about this and think it through\nYou have to be careful about how you go about this because you might end up using more energy rather than less it depends on the energy use of the alternative that's the problem\nRight then you decide to just you know blind\nIt depends on the energy use of the alternative that's the problem right when you decide and just you know blindly regulation not you know something this is a good example of why it's ...\nIt's been kind of a victim mandate outer parcel better for people to vote the way they do\nBut surely it boils down to whether it's best to to use reusable items again and again or do you talk to a cognitive science shows that you are damaging environments led by not using plastic fault surely there isn't much of a debate about election representing the interests of pocket folk my 'cause\nI don't represent anyone's interest by the way I guess I've said over and over again to you that getting rid of most single use plastic probably makes a pretty good sense but getting rid of all\nI don't know and that's what bothers me about this legislation 'cause they maybe circumstances which the alternative material actually causes more harm the environment because in in the nature of the way you use\n[noise] Peter Morici who's an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland in the U.S what did you make about ...\nWell [laughter] I understand what he's saying about having to look at the energy footprint of alternative but I Do think that environments degradation on climate change\nThat we're seeing in the world today is such a pressing issue and we need sweeping I'm an action ... scale on this and of course looking at plastic is not new um we've seen plastic bags being banned on the African continent for example in Rwanda Kenya\nMarch ... and Morocco\nAnd of course across the world we both have the taxes on plastic bags and I think it's a very welcome development my slights um reservation\nIs around the bottom plastic strollers in particular and I've been leading the consensus from disability rights can campaign has about this and who took about how many people with disabilities need plastics jaws um in order to be able to drink liquids and\nKind of use metal ones opaque well I well actually\nOther materials such as paper on mental a glass of silicon don't necessarily what so many people can be allergic to them they can cause injury and that can be choking hazards metal for example it's not safe\nFor hot liquids and paid petted soldiers with repeat to use\n'em so I Do I Do have some concerns around the ban on plastic strollers um but by and large I think it's a beyond that it's a welcome development\nAnd I'd also like to let not just a single use plastic but other kinds of plastic that's in the oceans as well so I was really struck by the high proportion of plastic and in the oceans that's due to fishing I think twenty seven percent of the ... on a beach is\nFrom that and and I'd like to look at that as well as um clean up as well as prevention\nMatthew oh this is an issue close to your heart's if the civil liberties issue I think is is

an on any political issues than Europe\nTaking strong action on these um but that seems sort of a ground breaking it will will quiet yeah it is it's a directive it say she has not yet nor of course but hopefully it will lead to legislation which were false industry to change 'em but there's also things we can do as well I don't know if you've come across ... brakes\nThese incredible innovation that's being used plastic both ... yeah that's right it's it's they're being used in South Africa or in parts of Southeast Asia or essentially you take a plastic ball for robbing and farming in a way you fill it up\nVery you you you you pack it very densely with other pieces of plastic a way that you would normally have just ... in the band and gradually you get a very solid piece of building material it if you can get it to the right place can be used to create a structure that's going to stand there for a thousand years so I was like we need to do a feature on [laughter]\nYeah that's an

Brussels\nHave popped up in some cities on this subject it's fair to say that science fiction films haven't inspired optimism from the Nineteen seventies the step for wives where ambitious women are transformed into do style husband pleasing awesome Mesa\nAnd more recently the British movie ... which a female robot stabbed so let's see if he is create to the city is having used that word for a while to death\nSo robots are going profoundly to change our lives and all sorts of ways but how will they affect on sexual behavior\nChildren after the room ... flights health warning Kate Devlin is a senior lecturer in digital humanities at London University King's College and she has the answer to everything you've ever wanted to know about sex row boats but were afraid to ask a new book\nIs called toned on science sects and robots and she joins us in Studio welcome Kate morning are quite positive about sex robots aren't you\nIt away I mean I think there is potential for technology to help us with relationships to help us with intimacy and to bring pleasure to people but whether or not comes in\nI think there is potential for technology to help us with relationships to help us with intimacy on to bring pleasure to people but whether or not that comes in the form of the currents extra boats is another story was how the ... there's really no to any\nRead eat we kind of have one in prototype that ... to ship to customers ... any time now I really and it's essentially a sex told her I loved all\nI'm with an animatronic had uh how'd you hear from them that why is it\nSo different from a blow up\nLove a wouldn't blow up the things that quite expensive um they ... up with a [laughter] it's probably up with a little too much too early Mac died the dollars upwards to buy one of these robots um five thousand dollars up words if you just want to adult version or may not have silicone\nThey are um sculpted they are they are kind of think it does works of art and but they don't look anything like humans rated\nOkay we're going to expel a few minutes in a moment what do you make of the concept Chitra very briefly of the sex robots before we go on\nWell I find that really striking that human beings can do all kinds of things with technology and this is why we put a essence\nRice sex robots kind of feel ... and you know divorcing the sexual act entirely from feeling comes with risks or does it\nI I don't think it necessarily ... you know that sex toys for example looking around for hundreds if not thousands of years the difference here is that the current form of ... is a humanoid form that that's the problem because it tends to be a very productive stereotype of female body\n[noise] and and that's the problem why are we talking just about the female body on the robot for women on the sex robots for gay women\nKnow they're not yet there are not yet at this at a male version of a sex or will it tends to be a straight men that are buying the robots that doesn't\nTouch is interesting because on most sex toys still does which suggests that the to the classic lead on would be a you know they'll do based sex ...\nSo essentially that something else here and I think there's two streams what the two lines of developmental want us to sex toy like you say there's this big things like delivering vibrate or through my ... years on the other it's a sex all the sexual has always been a fairly nice market for manned\nOkay entitlement and some men in in sexual terms you know this is an area that brings huge alarm bells\nUm the compliance ever willing female figure is in policy isn't it in the form of the passive sects do which takes what he's given to it it it it's offensive to many people on all sorts of levels\nAbsolutely I I'm not something we'd be fed by ... fight on the air is as well and of course which always the hinges on a dystopian plot where the the woman got to be a potato and uh the female robots or takes over as a threat to men I think there's a certain power levels with with real life than not fear\nA but yes it is it's just this past the female form that we have and I I strongly asked me if your wife not because we have technology that could do wonderful things in terms of helping relationships in terms of bringing pleasure and it doesn't have to be in this form\nIt's open field for questions Matthew I'm kind of love it's the venture into this minefield I'll have to admit poor when I saw that this was going to be a topic of discussion it just before I let you in the morning but K. I. average don't shy away that you know I've I've ... my my mom has raised ...\nBecame ... can you tell us how you go into this topic what drew you to this you know I wanted to address that question [laughter] I thought it was to read\n[laughter] well I mean it's a fascinating subject area um it came about rainy from a sitting up in the pub after a conference will come to the system talking with a group of colleagues same when is it a bite develop have symptoms that can think why or why why why we feel this effort and decreasing\nThe the whole point is whether we like or not we want to replicate our our genes Chitra [noise]\nYes I mean we've touched on this slightly ... I Want to explore more and we don't want to read about one six robots would mean for human sexuality\nParticularly given that that as we mentioned already designed by men woman suggested straight man what are the implications for women especially when it comes to attitudes around agency consent and lights and and also a link to that is not a perfect an allergy but when you look at pornography\nThen up to kill the racial stereotypes um that uh put fluids in pornography as well and I'm just wondering about I guess the the race and gender implications of a move towards um sex robots ... ideas K\nYeah that's right I think it's very problematic at the moment it's very much a a male straight while I'm al ...\nA lost word has her normative so the idea that people um are in relationships are straight on on monogamous and I'm featured in this case um it's it's a month and a woman and it's it's a sex symbol of China [noise]\nUm I think that that sounded problem I think um we know that the ... the old stuff he made the sex all that we have today all tend to be in this um\nSalmon I type of sexual form and they all tend to be white as well or whether they aren't where they're they're adults with a different skin color they are as you say they're kind of ... sized\nUm this is problematic on and I think that we do have to really address stop\nAnd look at new ways of doing anything I'm just a check or are we at the technological stage of development where robots can really accurately imitate a ... not ... the other problem we're very very bad at making human like robots which ... how sexy can they possibly be out ...\nIt's quite a bit ... and I think it will stay incredibly nice for quite some time\nBut we can can you know integrate virtual reality now these they I mean showing the technology is changing so quickly this also official intelligence as hyper realistic veal I mean the ... release of about ... took to convince me not somebody so they these are not in the mood give you a bit of [laughter] this ...\nThis robot that they have personalities that are being developed that you can carry around just starting to load up on your phone tablets you can have a virtual girlfriend in your phone they're working on a a meal version as well partly um so I think that's that's probably a more realistic convincing human than any robot\nWhat's being reception of your book case so sorry to a quick point I was going to\nSay just hearing you makes me I'm wonder why people need but she'll go for it and whether it is is this does it say something about him and he got boyfriends and girlfriends don't let me let's be honest it's not ... but she'll go friends that were talking about and does it say something about masculinity\nI'm In an era that you would rather have a vet she'll Gulf and who doesn't it's not a real human being with her own ideas and ...\n...\nYeah I think that's ... probably about it and I think ... the ... the idea that women are the emotional gatekeepers and so we of course you know we are able to go out there and and bomb socially but perhaps men have more problems\nWith a K Devlin author of turned on south science sex on robots many sites coming on the program picks thanks to August Chitra nights in our garage on in Lagos Matthew Green here in London thank you for this thing and joined the rest of your weekend by by for now\n[noise] distribution of the b._b._c.

lot of the people have message she have a what they said\nIt might not be able to get it all back he can get really good indication of what happened and it's about making people laugh that even if you haven't called the device it was sent from just a little you can get from the other device\nSay people and have a ceremony so once in a lot about Sarah was telling me especially the geeks and for these things that reminds me of the cause of white ...\nOtherwise if this is a form of an hacking in this case hacking for good to attract criminals and so on but I was really struck a ... in many ways about these digital trials that we'll see leave and we use washing machine like Hitler say what\nIt is is it's ... and and the Internet to things ... to sweat the small washing machine called
