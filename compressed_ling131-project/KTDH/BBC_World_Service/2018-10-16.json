others we Harvard University in the U.S\nIs fighting a lawsuit brought on behalf of Asian American students who failed to gain admission athletes houses policy known as affirmative action which many universities choose to adults to give disadvantaged groups a better chance of getting in\nThis means that they're not less in just on academic ability the Asian American students say they were good enough to get in but what kept out because African Americans and Hispanics have that chance is boosted by some direction racial balancing its cold\nThat we have from someone in favor of affirmative action in the moment but first the testimony of one student Kelly about civil\nI come from an Asian American background I'm a student at Harvard and I think actually the ... tennis university and that's a ... many other Asian Americans will have to come I think that when you look at the case here of affirmative action\nWe shouldn't be looking at whether or not affirmative action is right or wrong but started power formative action it's impacting different communities and the point of affirmative action has been in court\nCommunity that has historically than underrepresented are excluded it seems like it's found Asian American right now as it looks like Harvard and the shows are fees are\nDiscriminating against Asian American interest an article keeping that embrace lower\nIt's hard to say what Microsoft ... looks like a sort of how it affected me but I think the interesting thing is to look at it on the aggregate and how the Asian American population has been increasing in an ac rapidly but the amount of Asian American admitted to Harvard has been saying around the same as having more\nSo they have the idea that the students don't mind that speak to Gregory Davis who's a grad student at Harvard or an who's in favor of the affirmative action as it sounds Gregory thanks for coming on what's your reaction when you hear arguments such as those just made by Kelly ...\nA ... a her stance makes a lot of things and I am happiness here um but I think she's mistaken about what the\nPoint of affirmative action or support of affirmative action is not actually fair to\nMake a underrepresented groups uh be more pressing the point of affirmative\nIs to increase diversity increase the benefits of diversity one thing that's been\nUnder represented groups uh be more pressing the point of a fan of action is to increase digressing increase the benefits of diversity one thing that's been that's not to them and talked about as much in\nThis lawsuit is what it means to have a critical mass here at Harvard and many other colleges and universities across the country there are a critical mass isn't quite frankly Asian students um don't have\nTo walk on campus I feel like they're necessarily represent this other group um or that they have to speak for every person from that background I'm this is particularly true of\nChinese um students are are students are Chinese background however for African Americans for Latino Americans for indigenous Americans which has not sent this is simply not\nOkay so you're saying that even ways affirmative action as it currently works in in in most areas of higher education I mean ... just tell us about your experience but as before you're ... you were at UCLA and one of the complications of this fact is is that in California\nAffirmative action isn't allowed so what was the effect on the view of walking into class being one of the very few African Americans I I presume that that's how you felt\nOh absolutely and there was the case um I entered into a class of about two hundred and fifty are entering law students and I was one of twelve African Americans um this is\nAnd the state of California which\nIs as much more than just a four percent uh three or three or four percent African American and Mrs in an environment in which I was you know in classes debating highly intellectual and highly social issue that involve things like race um in history\nAnd I was one of two African American men in the room that's how the huge effect on my ability to um to judge the issues to be able to voice my opinion without feeling like I was speaking on behalf of everything\nI can see that so it becomes it becomes personalized it becomes emotional on the coast what you'll you'll get to study principles and argue about a sort of intellectual facts are with without being muddied in that way [noise]\nI Wish that was the case yeah unfortunately it very rarely happens that\nWay for example in your class was than not one or two Asian or a Chinese and Marilyn how did we should defined them all have failed Reggie managed to establish numbers in the education system that means that they have support in critical mass of that kind\nI Believe they do now this is not to say that that aren't underrepresented sub groups within an Asian Americans are among the amenities as a Southeast Asian Pacific Islanders students I absolutely underrepresented um an all facets of higher education\nBut if we're going to talk about Asian Americans a as a general group um they're representing well both at schools that don't practice affirmative action in I argue schools that do\nAnd why would that be\nI think it has a lot to do with the caliber of students applying um the number of students applying um and where do they decide to aggregate the applications I\nObviously I I think it makes less than a lot of Asian Americans we apply to harbor um one interesting fact about this entire lawsuit that is not discussed as much as that I'm\nTwenty two percent of the entering class of Harvard every year um roughly\nAs Asian Americans but also twenty two percent of the application pool is Asian every year\nWell they you up affirmative action two sides of the student argument is document that is being taken to the court case or taking to coach a against Harvard University at the moment\nI should say is a little bit of background in this um many places um and you had that for example California actually bans affirmative action but Harvard as a private institution or because of the ...\nGround and there's so many places I'm a new ... for example California actually bans affirmative action but Harvard as a private institution or because of the state level and under its own a constitution decides that they want to do that that's why they go ahead and do this\nIf it's a private institution that they can make that\nGoes by the last movie that you have to be in a state where you can have affirmative action or and or many people are interpreting this is a really significant court cases\nOver the legality of affirmative action in many of the ... is not just in the academic\nSphere and I'm a there's lots of accusations about who's on behalf of whom and who's wearing a tool divided along sort of community\nAh backgrounds no I'm Talking about close in Britain that would be a close issue or rather than a a a race and the ... election issue off a little more so if one fascinating arguments going on or we can cold\n\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

to for profit basis or to help develop or help tourism et cetera because of\nHow will the often the American officer the confidence look different to the Chinese one because\nUh critics say that the Chinese model ends up settling African countries recipients with a great deal of debt and not much in return to the infrastructure\nOn the other hand many African governments around the please not to hear a constant west in an American going on about governance and rights and those kind of things which the Chinese um understand Robyn less concerned with so um what is this going to look like to the African continent is\nThe most important thing that will do is give African partners choices [noise] um so uh choices with um a major infrastructure or a project choices manufacturing and most significantly\nUm choices with a world class company it's a that can engage in the series of a private sector or initiatives that African states have their own\nUh and as we all know uh when there is serious competition [noise] I'm a African states will get better deals as opposed to having to be saddled with\nA large Chinese engagement that leads to a long term debt which friend can you be

wasn't come on to talk about or it said that word or put the word of right\nIn the newspaper so they often use the word such as violated or if the victim is under aged than they would say they were
