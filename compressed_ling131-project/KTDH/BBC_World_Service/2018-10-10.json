the United states is that his country's may not like\nI said that's what we know that if we say we're going to do something we fall when the president for that whether it was the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO sang in other countries have to pay their share and it whether to try and deal with the main thing they\nIt's easier to gather we'd solve a lot of problems one of the process of selling a lot of problems\nOne half of them for the United states on foreign policy now the United states if I may have life\nMy favorite if we say we're going to do something we fall for that whether it was it the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was saying that our country to pay their share I mean whether the type of work and then I made that followed through with that\nUm it's highly is one of the few high profile but in in the administration of former governor of South Carolina she had been a critic of Donald Trump but once you go to jumps you became loyal\nAnd a forceful and voice for the president or an also kept lines of communication open at the un ah she said to be close to Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner yesterday at that press conference she described him as quote a hidden genius but no one understands that there's still a baby she's ... in LA what if she got\nShe says she's going because she has been in public life for a number of years now and she simply wants to step back from it she says she doesn't believe in term limits in other words he doesn't believe in indefinite row in public life so she wants to step back\nAnd let someone else in to do what is going to say quite a difficult job with a tensions between the U.S and\nMany other nations at the moment just look at the relationship with\nRussia with Iran the runway all all of those issues Nicholas North Korea as well that Nikki Haley has been absolutely central to in terms of sanctions against that country it's a it's a tough job and she says she wants to step back from it and give someone else a guy that's one of the speculation is that she is a very ambitious\nPolitical animal and the hops one day she my my son for the presidency herself\nWhat does she ... she left on very good terms but she always agreed with Donald Trump had she\nNo she didn't always agree that indeed during his election campaign she uh initially didn't support him but they have become pretty close uh she certainly echoed his\nAmerica for St message chip hops a that applies to always be domestic policy but on the international studies you know she was a quite a strident critics for example of of Russia on Syria of course up the UN but especially on Russia She she seem more inclined to criticize Russia whereas the president's might stay\nQuiet she has said many things that clearly that the president agrees with she was fiercely critical of what she claimed to be on the global the anti Israel biased over the United\nNations says she supported the shutting off of us funding for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency in terms of the detail of a lot of the policy she was echoing what Donald Trump\nSaid but equally she was a single minded person that I think it was part of the

social media and said that she's not in the running\nOh so they're not sending dynamite to the un not yet anyway that was ... like you're reflecting on the very Cody will departure of Nikki Haley much speculation in the press and the pipe is about what she does next or whether she will prepare for a a tool to the presidency or not next time nothing twenty twenty but possibly\nUm after that this is

and women from Maine because they were playing with fire I gather on and a\nBar with all of a it was a little different for me um I did encounter some\nA kind of you know uh in ... you know and do it in the beginning when I came to Mumbai um and I sort of a always avoided um that sort of group and the people who fog than windows to me and I never worked with them I never ended up working with them\nI always ended up working with people who later became friends and then I kept repeating working with them\nSo up to be honest I avoided a ... problem\nSee I ended up the way you deal with them is to avoid working with them to do where you vocal against these people that are ... year and there's\nYes in the beginning I\nJust said that okay no thank you I work with some other people because I I I don't I I'm not going to talk on to something like that but if you know the thing is it's never did it it's always it's come in I'm In a suggestion\nAnd when I got that suggestion I just I just said that don't get fined I'm not going to need that person anymore\nAnd so in the beginning in the first one on to your the my career that's what I did and then in the industry\nEveryone has a reputation right so the reputation threads that she is never going to do it [laughter]\nSo then it became like a sort of a mutually repulsive a situation where I Would not go to them and they will not even on to me in that film because\nThey know that it's not going to happen with me and the so I ended up working with people um I continuously ended up working with people repeatedly working with people who became friends and who really meant professionalism and walk and jobs there was no pressure on you know and that was going on\nAnd that was your way of dealing with it and then the ... the editor of the news a miniature told the BBC so many allegations have come a have come out now and something needs to be done about should you have the time and again when it comes to sexual harassment in India the ... are you confident that something will be done about this I think I think it's\nGoing to take time but what is a wonderful is that the young girls are really really courageous it wasn't like that then you know back Fifteen Years back when I started working\nLike I wouldn't uh come out in public and the president said that also end to it I Try to do that with me and that's I'm not working that's on right right I Would just say okay like forget about it I'm not looking at that person because you might try to do that I because I felt that there isn't in in in when do end up suggestion\nSo I said okay fine I Walk with each other a lot of people right but now I Want to because it it's such a boy's club now what has happened is that the young little girl that read I Am so happy that for ages the empowered their thing that oh you know so and so did it\nUh I'm Out in public and the breadth and the that also and I try to do that with me and that's I'm not working right
