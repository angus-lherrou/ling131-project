clear that the Democrats are likely to retake the house\nBut suddenly the Senate team didn't play that process did change after the cabinet controversy\nIt did fire up Republican voters\nAnd so many people believe that the Senate very well could stay Republican there's no question this was a powerful political moment for both parties and I think that Trump is trying to keep that fire under Republican voters until we hit the mid term election\nFor bright when it comes to public perceptions\nThe Supreme Court which is hugely important part of the constitution the American way of life the
