[noise]\nWhat happens to information but objects fall into a black hole that's the question posed in professor Steven Hawkins locked academic work it's called black hole entropy unsolved\nHave such a heck of it is one of the co authors of the papers you work with Stephen and department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics\nAt University of Cambridge and she joins me now and of course I'm oversimplifying crazily really but this is about black holes having sheets which means he dissipates black holes might disappear what happens to the objects\nAnd that's exactly what it's about we're trying to find a resolution to this problem and called information powder which is something that Stephen Hawking has been\nUm really obsessed with the last ... years we'll say on this problem as essentially as you said what happens objects when they fall into a black hole where does the information about these objects guys\nAnd usually we think that from the outside you can't tell anything about what's inside the black hole and they want something flew into a black hole all his nation about that passed last forever and what we've been trying to do is to um traces information and find a way of recovering this information\nAnd how how far have you well we're not definitely not that we we were one step forward I'd say we've shown that I'm so there's a way of describing movies mission in a black hole an optical entropy and we've shown that there was a way that we can say this entropy\nAnd but this is this is just one step along the road\nAnd what's next that because I I suppose my next question is can you go further without that remarkable brain\nWell it's\nI mean it's going to be difficult Steven had um a multiple intuition and amazing inside and he would often I'm\nSort of

in one sentence something he thought it would be the case of what's going to happen and we don't get confused for a while and then you know among place have you on the right and\nIt was just so youthful having somebody has some amazing and intuition about how things should walk\nSays it will ... is definitely gonna be different different and more difficult without him about what I'm saying he's still going to try the next step really is to try and walk out\nAnd if we can recover how much of the information we can recover and if this description and all the information paradox could possibly and actually result this problem and if we could recover or to the information that's in a black hole\nAnd this is not just about the theory is that we're learning so much in this exploration about where we all go anywhere on a planet where a universe is going\n[noise] yes I mean did the black holes week considering all all real and black holes ... sensitive after physical black holes and so they really relate to and the universe and how and things interacting with black holes and things interacting the universe is\nSuch a really interesting to meet you and thank you so much for explaining that so clearly special ... who's also one of the co authors of the paper with Stephen Hawking which is called black hole entropy and soft I didn't ask a quick claim softer software is one
