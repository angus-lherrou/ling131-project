they'll provide additional information that may lead other other places\nAnd is it your under an understanding that the FBI would that have the authorization to do those subsequent interviews or for quiet\nWell that's a that's a question it's kind of up in the air the president seemed to indicate that they could follow the lead to where they wanted to go but there may be some conflict with the office of legal counsel which works for the president this is all going to depend on what the director ... director Christopher Wray tells his age and if you want them to do\nI truly believe that there'll be able to follow a logical leads what the president will probably not allow them to do\nIs to go out into other allegations that are not related to the one plane made by a\nDoctor for or any of the other people that are are authorized for interview this was still in negotiations with the with the Senate so we'll have to see how it plays out in the next seven days\nOnce said to complete

the village and forcibly displaced a presumably the the residents to different location or\nJust remind us so why does the government wanted to demolish it\nThere's a few levels you have to understand here the the reasoning that the government is giving is that it's a simple planning issue which you know sounds innocent enough but there's two other issues that place here and one is that we're talking about occupied territory\nAnd according to human rights groups of the Palestinian authority is and as most world leaders forcibly displaced thing that protected population in occupied territory is anything from a war crime to a great for each of international law and on the geopolitical level it the location of the village is very very important\nUm it's it's in a place of the west bank where if\nThe Palestinian population is removed and Israeli settlements coming to replace them where there's already settlements or exist in there are many people say that it would it would cut the west bank into two different pieces\nI'm making a contiguous territory impossible should we ever see some sort of peace deal mhm and it would also cut off East Jerusalem which many people uh [noise]\nBy the Palestinians and much of the world believe to be a will be the capital of a of a Palestinian state cut it off from the rest of the west bank\nA piece of people have been living here since the Nineteen fifties now these rainy government said the structures we built on state owned land without ... from the Israeli miniature ... which undid the Nineteen Ninety three ... students have control over construction in sixty percent of the west bank known as Area C students this fall within ... the\nIt does the residents claim that it's actually privately owned land owned by a a a nearby Palestinian town\nUh but the other thing you have to understand about Area C and and there's really control there is that the Israeli military which is responsible for approving a building permits and in that area that you mentioned denies\nWell over Ninety percent of Palestinian requests for building permits and the residents of ... one of their their last ditch attempts to stave off this this demolition was to submit a their own planning\nA their own master plan for for normalizing the the the the building permanence of of their village and something that Israeli government allows settlers Jewish Israeli settlers to do when when they're caught building a what the Israeli government that describes okay does go ahead\nMichael surely the Israeli government then has offered them an alternative taste to go to despite a international objection to this has been an alternative Peyton where would that be then\nThere is it's a location not too far away um it's drilled so very close to a trash dumped\nWhich is something that Israeli government allows settlers Jewish Israeli settlers to do when when they're caught building or what the Israeli government that describes as go ahead\nMichael surely the Israeli government then has offered them an alternative taste kid go to the despite an international objection to this ... where would that be then\nThere is it's a a location not too far away um\nIt's also very close to a trash dumped a which is you can imagine it's not it's not ideal for this for this residents and the other the other problem they have with it is that it's it would presumably stop them from\nA continuing their uh their lifestyle which involves are hurting and and other agrarian aspects\nOkay and it has become an international issue we said there's been a number of international objection to this including the un advising against it but in Japan has not and nascent has gone to had to wait to I said what's likely to happen if this should go ahead\nYou know the Israeli government has been trying to to sort of take over this area and remove the Palestinian population for a few decades now and up until the Trump Administration the Americans and the rest of the world have essentially told the Israeli government do not do this ...\nAnd now there's there's very little resistance I'm at the European Parliament warns that it would be a grave rich rich international law uh last year the\nMany European countries want Israel that there would be a reaction that this happened but it doesn't seem that there's any any real threat\nOkay Michael ... editor in chief of the methane is made in academe plus nine seven two\nScientists was discovered that a key priced sets in Christ of life may have taken place in outer space

Canada was playing a tougher game\nBut minutes before us imposed deadline on Sunday night also and Washington reached an agreement both sides say the United states Mexico Canada agreement\nWill result in free markets ferret trade and rebuffed economic growth in the region but kind of the house how to given to some American demands dumped him and he joins of trade experts at all to the university\nTold me that kind of the house negotiated hard on prevented us from getting everything that it wanted\nAt the Canadian team has done very well on this negotiated pretty odd\nUm has read correctly the constraint on Donald Trump that actually published by HIV and congrats on the U.S business I'm Sorry threat was that it kind of you know if it wasn't going to play pool he would go ahead with the bilateral agreement with the United states and Mexico\nBut the reality ones he would have struggled to get through that for the U.S Congress and they would've been a huge amount of pressure on him again such a bilateral deal that that's kind of outcome from his own business people that we could have not really a credible threat and the Canadian understood that\nCanada though have had to allow us farmers more access to a dairy market and this was a big sticking point ... wouldn't do this to this potential you tried out of them into the field for Canada\nIt's very early hours we're really in the very we haven't seen the details of the tax my understanding is that what they were the Canadian the greed it's only a tiny bit more than they already agreed back in the days of the Trans Pacific partnership agreement\nI'm so back then they promised 'em the benefit of the TPP which included the United states of course access that dairy market by opening up a little bit over three percent of the dairy market\nAnd my understanding is I haven't seen attack yet but my understanding is that they can a tiny bit more than that but it isn't it's nowhere near the radical overhaul and opening up of the Canadian dairy sect that the u._s. which was aiming for the start to talk\nBut why is that is it because older people are more resilient to worries about learning it\nI think that's really good point I think one of the things is that we know that\nWhen you're very young it as a time when people feel emotions very intensely and also this may be the first time that you felt this this painful feeling of loneliness and older people may have the experience to have learned that it usually policies because we know that most loneliness is temporary and that usually people get out of it\nAnd of course if you're younger you haven't had the chance to know that\nWhen we all people who are older to look back and we often when they with ammonia civil they said it was also when they were young adults so I don't think it something about life I think this may ways of being the case it was just never mentioned before that may be used as a time when you feel more lonely and that's interesting because it's going to talk about social\nIt's this this painful feeling of loneliness and older people may have the experience to have learned that it usually policies because we know that most loneliness is temporary and that usually people get out of it\nAnd of course if you're younger you haven't had the chance to know that ... people who are older to look back and we all them when they with ammonia civil they said it was also when they were young adults so I don't think it was something about ... life I think that's my own ways of being the case it was just never measured before may be used as a time when you feel more lonely and that's\nInteresting because it's going to talk about social media but you said older people have felt lonely and when they were younger but Britain is the lonely loneliness capital of Europe why is that what does it tell us about the culture here because I'll tell you what what what is locked in in in London and the surrounding areas then he'll be make eye contact and that in itself can be quite low in the right\nYeah so we did all these people will if it was about their neighborhoods and and whether they would talk to people and also and it was interesting looking because we have people from all over the well take pause\nAnd in in nine countries in particular we were able to do more detailed comparisons and that we found that um the the UK and then and I'm from the U.S has kind of comparable levels of letting us and India there is a bit lower in New Zealand which was interesting\nAnd we also looked in in terms of bigger regions we looked at which countries\nAre places where people really value that independence and northern Europe has a place that would very much be the case and they have high levels of lending us in the countries where people were very independent than in the places where people tend to depend on each other more and be happy just depend on each other\nSo being independent it's not necessarily a good thing now the prime minister edited see I told you set up punching levy a loneliness and social isolation with wanting that millions of people were suffering from a lack of regular contact with ads which is what you were pointing to in being independent and how do you solve this though what the strategy\nWhere we are people ... solutions they founded what for them and of course with its own plus because this to find out what is actually what for people for people they know that it is amazing\nUm number one was finding distracting activities or or dedicating your time to work or study all hope is next for joining a social plop all that that also came a list of most um helpful suggestions that people make so it's not for everybody\nI'm changing your thinking to make it more positive to to look I'm On the bright side of things of obviously sometimes are easier said than done\nAnd I I thought was interesting that you're starting a conversation with anyone because it hasn't got to be deep meaningful long conversations that people have that can alleviate loneliness chanting somebody when you buy your paper in the shuffle or your milk or or whatever those little things remind us we connect to everybody else in the real human and wrote in the same well\nAnd you can listen to the full results of that survey on loneliness on the health check program BBC well seven this Wednesday at

La Nina setting and I didn't mention that twenty eight team was going to be held comma\nEvery year has some extremes the world is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThough that impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of the uh systems science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods\nWildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there's some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually will captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks chops a gruff puffing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fine up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks early night among annual average is a ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages early parts of the climate story and know the ... the masses to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers too often we take this narrow view\nThat climate is about averages and yet we expect average temperatures on earth to continue to increase and that has huge ramifications for global sea level rise for melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather and those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes\nAnd so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes are changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather and those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes\nAnd so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes are changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting their unfolding in real time on our television screens in in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change did says the face of climate change\nNevertheless I voted wants to be cautious weather of some kind of rule does happen every yeah\nAll right let ... anything to do what I Do and it's not necessarily harming our what we can say the reason why won't do echinacea or any of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different something that needs to be quite rare and now I read that they call it and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect them to become more frequent around the world\nOr the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived heads of heat heat waves the atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods at the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worst droughts you take\nExtreme drought you combine it with extreme heat you're going to get wildfires so that science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science or as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the model\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is the fact that climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream in a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger in apple attitude and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the high stress the jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks they also put another high over Siberia with high heat that and over North America\nWhere the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California with seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael mine\nIt's getting warmer and warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress\nUm the summer droughts are so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires in what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season the California Winter isn't now California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was\nThe Thomas wildfire last winter in Southern California\nOnly this summer did we see an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire northern California and some of the other wildfires that broke out so California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is an indication\nThe notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season to California Winter isn't now California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was the Thomas wildfire last winter in Southern California\nOnly this summer did we see an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire northern California and some of the other wildfires that broke out so California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is an indication of the\nThe profound challenged the climate changes already posing\nTo us\nFrom our historic emergency the largest fire forty now bigger than the size of a fabulous\n\nPiece of conditions lived and experience fine then yeah queen Davidson a fire experts at the University of California\nCompounded the tree stressing effects of long term Trump was enough rain in northern California last winter to stimulate a surge of bras gross to add an abundance of drawing on the gross which few and far storms\nAnd some parts of California we had a hundred and eighty percent of normal for graft production so I think a lot of fire people were thinking\nYou know this just isn't looking good and all it's going to take is an ignition on the right day with the right whether to cause a real problem and so when the Carr Fire started I was over here I live on the coast and suffered from some of the hot weather and things like that but\nPretty immediately that fire was raising hairs and my husband actually went over and worked on that fire and um I I think we we're all feeling tension that we're not used to feeling around fire in California we've had it you know the last\nTen years we've had unprecedented fires almost every every year every other year but the Carr Fire felt different\n... affecting a major residential term walls in itself trying to find but the big one was the ... the Mendocino have actually a pair of finds that started on July the twenty seventh ... only finally confirmed extinguished last week\nThere was the ranch fire and the river fire and those were burning near to each other on the north and west sides of clear lake which is one of the largest lakes in California it was during the height of the summer so the hottest days over a hundred degrees solid winds blowing through those areas it\nJust all the right conditions for fat tire spread and extreme fire behavior and so the fires grew so quickly\nThey were sometimes burning twenty thousand acres in a twenty four hour period or or more maybe\nThe the rate of growth made it very difficult for cruised to to get a handle on it and they ended up burning four hundred and ten thousand acres and I we all have heard that that's the biggest fire in California history I think that the next big it was last year in Southern California at two hundred and eighty thousand acres so\nA very large area\nOf course is not just being heat waves and fires while California bunt in camera south India they have the worst monsoon fighting in a hundred years\nMay come to Carolina\nDid buy them more

[noise]\nYour\nLimits are Lewis was WorldCom rely on the rainiest state TV and the writing on the ... said done with America John with Israel and done with the ruling royal family in Saudi Arabia and there was a map showing the target outlook come out in eastern Syria on it [noise]\n\nWe have somebody took place during a military parade in Los Angeles one of the deadliest in Iran putting in a decade I've been speaking hardly doctor she is a non resident fellow with the Americans think factory a slump to console she edits his blood pooled Iran source\nMorning the atomic revolutionary Guard Corps launched about six I'm short range ballistic missiles into Syria they claimed that this is in retaliation of a lot of terrorist attack that killed about twenty five people in the um the province of Kurdistan\nAnd typically are the first trade was actually part of a bigger parade\nI mean I've been speaking of the holy dogs issues among residents with the Americans think so I just want to come so she had this this phone call to Iran\nThis morning the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps launched about six I'm short range ballistic missiles into Syria they claim that this is in retaliation of dialogue terrorist attack that killed about twenty five people and um [noise] um the province of ...\nAnd typically are the laws parade was actually part of a bigger paraded throughout the country that mark the anniversary of the Iran Iraq War so is the Rania\nIranian celebrated it as a Memorial Day essentially so the attack was I'm a big deal in Iran it was the second terrorist attack Iran has seen in the past two years\nSo it was interesting was seeing that they were actually launching missiles and retaliation now what's worth mentioning is that last year when there was terror attacks and tear on twin terror attacks a week later the Irish juicy also launch missiles into Syria\nAnd that also happened a week after so this is actually the second time we've seen Iran launch missiles in retaliation for terror attacks\nOn who is the target who do they think they are targeting in response for about ... [noise]\nUm I I think it's also worth mentioning is that initially the plane was put on athletic separatist groups and one group did specifically come out and say that they were responsible for it not them themselves who are based in Denmark\nBut third group inside um Iran and Iraq was responsible and that they had not given the okay so that's very interesting to note but at the same time the Iranian government has been putting the blame on the U.S Saudi Arabia Israel and the United Arab Emirates and they've been saying that they've been back in the separatist groups\nAnd that they've been backing ISIS and so what this attack supposedly according to what we've been reading on state media is that they were attacking text fury terrorists which is essentially another word for ISIS\nAnd it seems that these were I'm focusing on ISIS strongholds in Syria and this is exactly what happened in June two thousand and Seventeen when they did a similar launch in Syria\n[noise] total submitted by your cross national resistance movement that wants to split Iran all the ... I think for most people this will be a new name\nIt's a new name for a lot of us as well focusing on Iran or a lot of the separatist groups don't do not have much back backing from the Iranian people\nAnd there are at least half a dozen of them that exists now a there was even as it is an initial confusion about which off of the group it was and so um I think that by throwing their accusations that way and also finding that one group had said that they're responsible the Iranian government is able to actually [noise]\nOn more of the activists inside of Iran the act Arab acts of this um [noise]\nThe send the activists in Iran and I think another thing that's worth mentioning is when you think of advise people tend to think that it's a Sunni majority promise when it's not there actually Shia so for them to the Iranian government to come out and say that these are you a factor Saudi backed separatists groups it's not exactly accurate\nIt would mean that they're backing these shapes um groups within Iran which would be very interesting angle to take on although historically they have had some instances like in Yemen during the Nineteen seventies when the who the as were backed by Saudi Arabia so we didn't exactly be unprecedented\nAnd that's the way things are to hold it Douglas who's from the Atlantic council you know there's things will update from the BBC\nActually yeah so for them to the Iranian government to come out and say that these are you a factor Saudi backed separatists groups are not exactly accurate\nIt would mean that they're backing the shapes um groups within Iran which would be very interesting angle to take on although historically they have had some instances like in Yemen during the Nineteen Seventy is on the hook these are backed by Saudi Arabia so we didn't exactly be unprecedented\n[noise] and that's the way things looked to hold a diverse who's from the Atlantic council you know this new world updates from the BBC\nThe first lady of the United states millennial Trump's traveling to Africa on a diplomatic on humanitarian visits a first time\nAnd that kind of mission of the main focuses on the wellbeing of children or be best initiative on her first up is a car in Guyana then she'll go on to Malawi Kenya and Egypt joining us from across is Elizabeth I had a a former minister of state thanks for being with us on world up to it\nWhat do you hope Milan here can bring\n\nBring I'm not sure I'm just hoping that um she would see China and Africa in and lied to that she doesn't know and then be able to talk about it tested in a positive manner [noise]\nWhat are the kinds of things you would want to see to demonstrate a positive message\nWell that people had a dynamic in wanting to improve apple under quality of the highlights all the time and that people here that young people in particular\nAre anxious to be accepted then to do things that will make them competitive in the rest of the welder so that they can\nA deep pocket and regarded that's a normal part of the world and people are not looking to\nThe rest of the world to feed them or to look after them but simply to be able to ... to be able to improve our phone up all your life that's the kind of thing that we would really\nBe glad if she would see acid that life is you see that ... is that really would be good\nBecause that's the question isn't it how would she be received we know that President Trump ... husband that said things about um I'm not going to call it the whole thing but you know as you know countries\nAre a ... of gives you an indication that people from Africa or not welcome\nIn the United states the same time she's the acting as she says to support children but children from Mexico and other places have not been treated well in the United states when all of that come up do you think\nI I don't think it to be the last stop on anybody here or in other parts of on the continent\nThat Sam ... has been did that's not it's not seen in a very positive light here but that's why it's a good idea for him to come and see and maybe maybe go back and tell him that you know these places that not all of them\nWhat they were you think they are so obviously you know for example it should be a world of difference from say two thousand nine nine when Burr apple and and that Michelle Obama\nCame to guy now and the effect ship to Africa when everybody was\nYou know falling over themselves to because simply that that they had agreed they have chosen not to come I don't think you if you go out on the streets right now you would see that kind of enthusiasm indeed I asked a few people and not many people knew that\nDave where you think they are so obviously you know for example it should be aware of the different from say two thousand nine when bad apples and and that Michelle Obama\nCame to guy now and the feds trip to Africa when everybody was you know falling over themselves to because simply did that they had agreed they had chosen guy not to come I don't think you if you go out on the streets right now you would see that kind of enthusiasm indeed asked a few people\nAnd not many people even knew the name of they've ... they've got the name of the ... of America\nNever mind that even asked you what's coming so we don't have the same kind of enthusiasm that she's coming and then also having said all that I might add that you know that may ... may be normally doesn't travel empty handed so who knows she might\nUh [noise] uh refurbish when a hospital ward who knows\nThanks am I going to lead Elizabeth and thank you for joining us somewhere up there from a gun am minister of state we'll see how that trip goes there will be of course a lot of very sort of\nHeadlines surrounding Maloney of Trump's visit to Africa but we'll try and reported as fairly as we can err on the b._b._c. World Service [noise]\nTo against the agreement ... exactly what what is it that makes this such a nationalist issue would it mean to the great I loved ones before\nYes indeed well it was um\nIt has been a very painful issue that has been ongoing for twenty seven year then they have been different proposals under the table but we've never had the situation where actually the sides could say we could we could live with this and this could be a decent solution what my students have insisted for\nIn all these years of negotiations under un Austin says was that\nThe identity is not to be and not to be part of the deal in the sense that students have to be ... and the language cannot be change than it does make a donation and a regardless of how the name is called a\nNow adding that I'm adding north uh too much ...\nWas seen and was estimated to be a good solution a painful one again because it requires constitutional changes and uh and it is a very emotional issues because nationalist have been\nHave been a building the agenda on that for for many many years\nUh but this goes to show on one hand that\nThe boycott campaign was a successful as much as the government campaign had failed to convince people that this is a good solution that being said six hundred thousand that I'm voted for\nWhich the government is now saying that is enough to give it to legitimacy because if the census was not which was nine hundred thousand ... that the number of votes that should be in favor would have been for a hundred and fifty thousand and now they're saying that\nA vote with six hundred thousand votes for and very few are very few against gives them the legitimacy to to press on with the agreement but\nThen have to get it through the parliament which might not be so easy we'll see how that turns out on a thank you Annette Patricia ... from the Balkan investigative report\nSaying that is enough to give it to a messy because if the census was net which was nine hundred thousand half of that that number that should be in favor would have been for a hundred and fifty thousand and now they're saying that\nI felt like six hundred thousand dollars for and very few in a very few Afghans give them their legitimacy to press on with the agreement about\nThat then have to get it through the parliament which might not be so easy we'll see how that turns out on a thank you Annette Patricia ... from the Balkan investigative reporting network in Macedonia this is the b._b._c.

I should maybe just quickly sent that into context I mean basically what he was saying and he's a very much a pro Brexit air and self dominant Rob was that look if you were to deny if you have another referendum in this country about ... that would be to sort of deny the will of the people and that could lead to populism and he was saying if you um [noise]\nYou know if you don't think you could have populism in this country look at what had happened to the opposition Labour Party going from being a moderate policy on the germ under Tony Blair so what we have today and that's why you joined us anyway I guess if I was to sum it up a flowers to sum it up then I Would say that the essentially the conservative positive note exaggeration\nIs at war over breakfast I mean there's just no two
