the ... in the world anti Doping Agency\nLet's get some reaction from Russia and speech our Moscow correspondent ... thank you for speaking to us I'm just remind us if you would have some of the allegations\nWhile the allegations are coming from three sides against Russia from the Netherlands for the u._k. and for the U.S and what they amounts to is a a huge a case against Russia that has been involved in cyber attacks on many friends\nAre in particular in the Hague there was a huge wealth of evidence presented all staff and attempt to attack the\nUh to the wife ... system of the organization\nOr for the prevention of chemical weapons\nAre and that was a an an an as an attack for which for a Russian agent so that you they agents of military intelligence were expelled from the country because they were traveling\nOn diplomatic passport so as you said Russia's response has been to demand dismiss all the claims and that's been a ... round dismissal on all sides I it's a the the foreign ministry here for example is accusing the west of\nA stage managed propaganda campaign against Moscow\n... saying that the west is paranoid at suitcase in Russia is accusing the west of buying mania and saying that anyone with a mobile phone\nNow being accused of being spies already playing down a the the case against Russia and on the plane down particularly the evidence or do we know for a fact that some of the evidence for example presented in the Hague about these Russian a man accused of this that attempted attack\nOr we know that to to if demand which ... amount of a sudden the links to a military sites here in Moscow\nAnd also the taxi receipt that was presented as evidence one of the men took a taxi from a military facility to the apple a couple of days ahead of the attack I've called the taxi company they told me that is a genuine receipts it was one of the drivers have made the trip\nAnd there is no no reason to doubt the authenticity without receipts so it suggests a quite a quite extraordinary a skill the level of work by these Russian alleged fights\nAnd the idea of the slump the uh the sloppy work from the spies are I mean what led to believe the Russians are generally fairly proud of their intelligence services are they getting a sense that they're feeling that may be a that go I haven't been up to the their usual standards\nWell not if you want to state media not if you ... if you read the pro Kremlin press who are really up playing down the evidence is very very heavily into saying you know all of this is built on a few photos and a taxi receipts and sort of there's a lot of bluster and the state media\nOr on talking about because I say paranoia and are on the Russian campaigns and all the like but if you read social media yes that's been a lot of mockery of 'em are all the intelligence agencies have particularly this one agency agency military intelligence geo you\nAre a lot of joking and and and a sort of school and ready for that work so it is having an impact but politically or the question is bigger I think in broad I mean for example watching state TV yesterday and today President Putin is in India or the next couple of days or having a state that that that\nUh he recently hosted the Chinese President in Russia that the Austrian chunk today with here are just yesterday so a talk of Russia's isolated in a ... a prize states\nI think it doesn't doesn't really feel like that here but certainly I think Russia is worried about what the consequences might they have all these accusations and whether those accusations may ... translates into further sanctions and for the economic calm\nFor Russia I think that is something that Russia is concerned about less about\nPatients and whether they accusations ... translates into fed the sanctions and for the economic harm to Russia I think that is something that Russia is concerned about last about humiliation and being a pariah state but more worried about the practical implications\nSarah writes in most guys thank you very much and they took interest that about the Russian response to those claims by three western nations that Russia was ... ...
