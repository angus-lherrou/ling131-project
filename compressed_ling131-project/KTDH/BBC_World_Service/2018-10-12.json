journalists at the hundred and fifty in Louisville Courier journal as they report the opioid epidemic from the house of their community there were ... is one of the report as to why Kentucky had such high levels of opioid abuse\nOne reason is that that many years ago back in the nineties actually uh at the eastern part of our state the Appalachian region was basically a lot of pharmaceutical companies kind of targeted that area and and they\nBecame there was a lot of pills are being prescribed and\nSome people became addicted to those prescription pill that pain pills we have a high level of of pain and our of Appalachian region\nWhich has a many coal miners and other people who are involved in manual labor and and then uh end up with severe pain and and and a lot of people just became addicted to those medications\nAnd then once the addiction took hold there really wasn't enough treatment Centers for these are folks and then when um when the heroin came around they took that because they still had the addiction that hadn't been treated you'll do\nYeah and you'll pay pal Laura I'm Around a story with the headline pet owners abusing animals to get drugs would with I don't

the addiction crisis uh for almost eight years and have seen a lot of a\nReal heartbreak you know and families across the state because this this hits every ZIP Code or in our state and in our region I guess one of the\nThings that really stays with me is a I'm a mother of two and I've reported on babies being born drug dependent and so just seeing those babies holding them is feeling I'm shaking my arms and cry and\nAnd knowing that you know they're suffering a and and they've just come into the world so they're coming into the world suffering and that that was I think the most emotionally difficult thing for me\nTen minutes about this blind the wool documentary experience you had you had people in your office but six weeks to initiate yes we did and they\nWere in the trenches with us um I mean they went to uh the jail local jail I'm a very hard hit community in southern Indiana\nOr where they had a march or an overdose awareness day and I'm I've been writing extensively about them and also I mean they went to a ... a ride with the police\nHe was the one who was on the ground that selecting girls often managing scholarship program last time went on the organization was through the the marketing ability of the founder kicked him either\nWas able to win the million dollars in a competition through Facebook which then meant they could open up a bit on school but sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students according to their statements the police had been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girl told authorities that\nThey were as young as ten when the ... began\nOn ten girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names are given to staff of the time as many as thirty according to an internal charge to talk about\nDo you know how many girls will actually reduce the number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh ... how did the investigation unfolds will basically this was an organization that it had some rumors around it\nAnd it was no one in Liberia that there'd been accusations of rape but but really no one ever gone deep and to really find out what exactly happened and why it happened and also one of the interesting things about it is that the organization right after this happened there was never a negative repercussions their scope of operation within the country has grown\nThere was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that\nThat the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in his care\nOr so when the rates came to light\nThe organization essentially said unless within their press\nStatement that this was a community issue\nAccording to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central ... who died an intimate relationship with ... they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they had empowered by giving him the power to educate these these girls through their scholarships and also give them access to the school and then when it came to light\nHe had been ripping these girls they essentially said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations own operating\nCultures in a challenging contacts may have contributed to his ability to access onto abused young girl\nDemand ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveal\nCentral mine and they were going to station had an intimate relationship with the wind or they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they had empowered him by giving him the power to the educate these these girls through their scholarships and also give them access to the school\nAnd then when it came to light he had been riffing these girls they essentially said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations own operating\nCultures and a challenging contacts may have contributed to his ability to access and abused young girl they mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in how would you do and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be ... actually affected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so while the organization took steps to make sure that the tiny girl who had testified against him were tested and they didn't take steps to ensure that the white or student population also were tested so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named essence victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's a there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization according to our investigation really failed to confront and a meaningful way and uh\n[noise] so what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continued to operate generally there'll be any changes of told to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think the after this took place that's certainly true that the organization sought\nTo to strengthen its policies and sought to increase the hiring practices and implemented a whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually that was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time two girls were the first time according to their statements police so definitely the organization type the policies but almost immediately after the rates came to light the organization ended up really rising international prominence in the six months afterwards because of course the Ebola outbreak hit Liberia at that time and\nThe organizations founder and the organization overall we're courted very strongly by international press subsequently ... who's the head of the organization was named time person with a year\nWithin six months that these rapes and her organization coming to light a\nJournalist Finley young school foundation called mold and me how's this statement in June of ... fourteen ten brave\nGoals named jumps in the abuse of both of the academy undo the community as soon as the ... report to the senior

up to provide education for girls ended up being a place where a number of them was sexually abused as I said\nYeah then more than me educational channels humans founded by an American women kitchen miner who raised millions of dollars and it was even gone into a building or by the then president and Johnson said leaf by twenty fourteen however a number of guns had come forward and matching they had been raped by the organizations main coordinated Macintosh jumps and\nHe went to prison and later died of aids but the fact that the charge the will to able to operate unreasonable funds despite the scandal and get people in Liberia now one month to come to the store you know your long investigation on Tuesday me it's really young\nHe's behind the film an optical released today by ProPublica and time magazine\nSo the organization was funded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called West Point when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describe themselves as a former child soldier who was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and\nHe was the one who was on the grind selecting girls often and managing scholarship program\nBut sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students\nAccording to their statements that police had been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girl told authorities that they were as young as ten\nWhen the ... began on than girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names or given to staff at the time as many as thirty according to an internal charts talking\nYou know how many girls will actually raped as a number\nTangles testified in court against Macintosh on one of the interesting things about it is that there was never a negative repercussions there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that are the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in his care\nOr so when the rates came to light the organization essentially said that this was a community issue\nAccording to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central ... organization had an intimate relationship with the founder they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they hadn't power to him and then eventually said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an exception to the fact that perhaps the organizations own operating cultures and a challenging contacts may have contributed\nTo his ability to access and abused young girl they mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals that way when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be ... actually infected as well\nChallenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so what we know is that to students who are named essence victims by the by that\nSecond to the fact that perhaps the organizations own operating cultures and a challenge in context may have contributed to ability to access to abused young girl they mind ended up in prison

students who are named essence victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's a there's a strong public

operate to the generally there'll be any changes a tool to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place it's definitely true that the organization sought to to\nStrengthen its policies and sought to prove it's hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually that was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time two\nGirls were the first time according to their

discovery of antibiotics and the other years of the twentieth century\nWill the twenty first see the end of the effectiveness one of the reasons might be the widespread use of herbicides which is adding to the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria\nThat's according to new research by scientists in New Zealand and I spoke to one of them he is professor jak hind them an from the University of cancer brand new Zealand I asked him what's the connection between herbicides designed to kill weeds and antibiotic resistance\nNice surprise at all all of that is that as you say we expect her to die to kill plants and we expect antibiotics to kill bacteria but the chemistry of these different\nKinds of of agents and drugs are such that bacteria proceed both types of drugs as toxins\nHerbicides are not particularly good toxins for the time the bacteria that we study but the bacteria I don't know this and they react to them as if they were a good topic because these are or toxins because herbicides or core toxins they don't kill the bacteria\nKill bacteria but the chemistry of these different kinds of of agents and drugs are such that bacteria perceived both types of drugs as toxins\nHerbicides are not particularly good toxins for the time the bacteria that we study but the bacteria don't know this and they react to them as if they were good top ones\nBecause these are or toxins because herbicides or poor toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you'll get a sub lethal effect\nBacteria would respond to these herbicides like turning on genes for pumps that remove all those toxins from inside themselves to outside\nThat pre adapt the bacteria for exposures to toxins that are much more potent like antibiotics so the herbicides in a sense are vaccinating the bacteria against the antibiotics\nAnd this is happening this person is on the way the most harmless of sounding places anyway ... thanks looms where people play with the dogs\nThat's right wherever herbicides and antibiotics may come together and they come together in these places because for example you might use herbicides on your lawn\nYour cat or or your neighbor's cat might walk through your lawn ... back into someone's house where they're stroked that puts her side and application levels on their hands and they made touched them out\nIf there are also on antibiotics or if the taxes on antibiotics we now have a combination of herbicide an antibiotic in this latest study\nWe found that that particular combination when herbicides and antibiotics come together\nThe development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicide\nWhat can be done professor\nWell first and foremost we have to have a much better understanding of all the different kinds of chemicals that are in commercial use for their impact on bacteria in these sub lethal effects on bacteria presently were unaware of any regulatory process in the world that asks these kinds of questions\nWhat would happen when these bacteria are exposed to sub lethal levels of chemicals or people are routinely using either and work or at home\nThen once we have some sense of what kind of combination of chemicals could induce antibiotic resistance that could inform us into possibly revising what we think of as appropriate use of the different kinds of manufacturing chemical\n[noise] can you imagine a post antibiotic era\nI can imagine it but it's not a very very pleasant image\nThe post antibiotic era will be like pre antibiotic era except we won't have the hope of new antibiotics so we have to be very very careful with the antibiotics we have now and the fuel yet to be discovered so that they continue to be useful to us in the future\n[noise] professor jak

comes to what the us is prepared to give\nMuch of the Trump Administration is reticent when it comes to hunting of an inch of war declaration various reasons for that that includes the fact that they have twenty eight thousand five hundred us troops based on their soil it may give North Korea and China the chance to turn around and go look\nWhy do you need these trips if there is no longer the war on that peninsula why do you need to have a presence in the south China Sea why do you need to have at ... you know military exercises\nAnd these trips but not the base here for North Korea debates
