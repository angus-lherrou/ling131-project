a lot of districts in Afghanistan\nThe way it works is that the administrative headquarters and a circle with a radius of about maybe half a kilometer around it is controlled by the government and not smart government administrator sits and there's a security posts a small contingent of Afghan police and then the villages are controlled by the Taliban\nSo by not reckoning I think we can say that
