to cry sits on friday I spoke to keep some prison drug policy expert at Stanford University what could politicians on this a new legislation white has\nJust said drugs crisis in the U.S gather such momentum\nBut we have three waves of bit swim nationally it starts due to poor regulation of pharmaceutical companies could make opioids\nWhich led to quite dribbling of prescribing in the United states from the mid nineties for about Fifteen Years and that bothers to level like about six times per capita what you would see in Great Britain for example\nThe bad guys many people addicted to prescription opioids and then came the second wave was that heroin traffickers are reasons correctly that if they opened up shop in a lot of American towns where they had previously not had a presence\nThere would be able to convert a lot of people from opioid pills to heroin and they were right and so then that started our second phase\nAnd then most recently in the last five years or so has been the infiltration\nOf heroin supply which fentanyl which is a synthetic opioid far more potent than heroin and that has turned a disaster into a catastrophe you know upper scale we haven't seen and drug policy and in several generations\nI mean what does tend to know and why it has become so popular among uses\nSentinel is entirely synthetic opioid that means that does not drive from the opium poppy you can make it in a lab or you could make it in your sink\nThere for many people can produce it and at the moment the main producers are in China which has a large chemical industry in large pharmaceutical industry they're not tightly regulated\nAnd with the Internet and you've been able to get markets where they sell directly to Americans and sometimes deliver a it here in our postal service\nAnd the other thing they've done is established links with Mexico where they deliver fentanyl Bennett's blended into the heroin which is very appealing to a heroin tracker because now you have a drug you can make justice strong at ...\nDeliver federal benefits blended into the heroin which is very appealing to heroin track or because now you have a drug you can make just as strong at much lower price than heroin cost and then that has been important in the U.S over the U.S Mexico border\nSo serious is the problem now in the United states the Democrats and Republicans have come together to back this legislation in an attempt to a kind of the appeal I cried says one of the main ended up and solve that legislation\nSo probably the first thing to note is it when it's not there which is there is not an enormous amount of money the parties were far apart on that issue nonetheless they did find a lot of sensible policies that weren't expensive but are should be helpful things like\nA reimbursing the training of people who specialize in addition having our Medicare program which is our program for senior citizens cover opioid addiction treatment which had not done up to that point\nA supporting efforts to use a different insurance program called Medicaid for people who are in a jails and prisons because they're extremely high risk of overdose and so\nThere's going to be demonstration projects where there'll be able to get access to health care before they leave prison and hopefully that will preserve their lives but there are many things like that that together I think we'll add up to sending some lives even though it's not a\nTransformative piece of legislation\nTo how we get a measure the success of this legislation would it be the reduction in the number of deaths from drug overdoses\nThat would certainly be a very good outcome although it's you know only one of multiple outcomes that ad or\nBeing addicted to opioids is very hard in people's health and also just they're functioning in daily life and their ability to hold a job or succeed in school or just play an active part in their families so also be measuring\nThe prevalence of addiction in the country and then we're going to major the prevalence of new addiction in other words if we're providing health care properly it's not just a matter of people who are already addicted\nSurviving we should stop creating as many addicted people as we have in prior years\nBut ... is a drug policy expert at Stanford University in the United states who's a what with the American politicians\nIn
