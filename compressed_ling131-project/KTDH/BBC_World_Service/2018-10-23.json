from around the world and in many African countries the abundance of wildlife brings in the business is a huge amounts of revenue but much of it is under threat\nIn addition to well known problems like poaching logging a new study has revealed the menu for continents protected areas such as national parks mostly underfunded\nJenny middle of the University of California is a coastal so it's a study\nAbout Ninety percent of protected areas with lions are underfunded it's a pretty dire situation we found that these parks require\nBetween one to two billion dollars annually on in order to adequately protect lands but they receive only me about three hundred and eighty million dollars annually so that's just about ten to twenty percent of what's needed\nSocial or just in those parts just the most protected areas ... billion dollars across the country that's correct amount no good change anytime soon as it\nNo in fact it may get to be a higher number\nAs lions continue to decline and the pressures on protected areas become worse but it's not all bad news because it's only one point two billion dollars I mean relatively [laughter]\nYou twice as much on the management of its national park system or you know that might be equivalent to a purchasing a U.S football team like the Detroit Lions so for a relatively small cost we really can save lions and their ecosystems\nAnd secure the backbone of Africa's parts\nIn the report you make the link or that if there isn't a major increase in funding that will be a decline in the population of ... where you focus your social mine's why what's the link\nOh because lions are the top predator in the ecosystem\nAnd so their survival is linked to the entire food Web all this focus levels below them so they're basically a proxy for the overall health of the ecosystem and we know that strong resilient ecosystems benefit people directly through ecosystem benefits like clean water\nHealthy soils and so saving protected areas saving wildlife is actually saving people it's an investment in people as well\nBut my assumption would be the um the funding ballparks\nLife is actually saving people it's an investment in people as well\nBut more from ... to the um the from doing ballparks long term problem and yet the lawyers would still look\nYes that's a good point um lions are very resilient species generally\nAbout where now at a tipping point for their species so unless we act now they're the she's will continue to decline\nAnd so that's why we feel like the timing of this study is particularly useful because we are at that tipping point the actions we take now will determine the future of the lions and they're larger ecosystems\nBut won't cause the streets which will be boys now as opposed to five years ago or ten years ago\n... decrees about forty percent in the last few decades and so we're really at that at that point where you know their populations have declined to the point where ecologically speaking they're just gonna keep heading south when it reaches a certain point in their population there's really just no turning back\nSo we feel like we're at the point now where there are still in us independent population that are resilient enough and strong enough and there's enough protected areas which is what we focus on that have good populations of lions that if we invest now we're going to prevent falling off the glass\nAnother argument you might read the report is saying there's a case for investing development from doing in protecting parks now if I'm In charge of advocating looks for money for development on drinking first of all hell for roads and schools not better funding for ... how'd you like our cars\nRight that is because a lot of people don't associate conservation with benefits to people and so they tend to invest in human focus development like infrastructure\nEducation but really investment in parks with wildlife is investment in people because of the benefits to ecosystem on human health but also tourism so it's important to realize that the wildlife watching industry in sub Saharan Africa generates an estimated thirty four billion dollars annually

I don't always have to\nFall or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if that has something to say that they want to show in the video and then I have to take that into consideration okay Kenny\nAt least to me through how you go from page to final productive what are your technique\nSo you know they gave me this song I go back I could listen to a song and meeting at Sikhs matches on pictures in my head like I can see like steel frame and I have to rebuild the gather from time to take me a long time I got to you know claims on while I'm washing my team got a point when I'm cooking\nAnd I have to reduce the gather and sometimes it takes me a long time I got to you know please don't when I'm watching my team I got a point when I'm cooking when I'm drinking some why\nBecause the thing I'm trying to the way from is\nThinking about the idea and it never watch for me I don't think about the idea and then she would come to me in weight than you know when I'm sleeping and that's why we have looked at when I'm speaking with a pen\nI just get up and I write it all down but then I'm going to forget as soon as I get up and I tried to make it as a visual as possible in words and then I sent it to them and hundreds of the hundred\nThe article I Love that idea\nThe ... a hundred percent I I don't know I didn't I didn't believe I I I Do have to think that that's what it is I shouldn't have been talking about it and you know\nAnd then of course I think at some point the liberal chalk that had come in in in my career boots off\nParts of it of course you get to the point I was like okay this is what we need to do that this is what we need to do I because I'm ... I'm a bit parts in\nSecond along stomach quintuplets in ... well not pitching lawn cutting that idea very passionate about it I can see I can teach that I can feel it I Do everything from but when you look at the gym you're going to win the prop usually the entire vision is what you just have to show up and you'll boxes\n[laughter] you know let me let me I'm ... I'm\nKenny to about ... over and over again she's brushing my teeth and drinking wine what about you how do you come to to get that decision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore\n[laughter] oh [laughter]\nAh [laughter] and\nAnd I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening crisis until you just can't you know maybe it's subliminal you know you want me so I guess yeah you don't even have the lyrics anymore you just feel it [noise]\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if you can't the problem is sometimes you get a truck and I like to get as a treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday [laughter] you know so\nThat's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market well maybe I'm just not as popular as director Comey but you know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors [noise] so that's a little tricky because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many ... hours I recently pitched on the cot is a ... and Jay Z\nAnd I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and\nI knew I was lucky just be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in a busy schedule I'm not sure they had time to talk to [laughter] so I just have to come up with an idea and cuts the best you know I didn't quite nail at that time but not so proud of being a director is that\nThere is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success rate show [laughter] but maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artist and you ... out of it can potentially be more competitive out bad because I Know there's a lot of direct it out there\nIs the biggest skill you if you're fishing for me on the energy project [laughter] that's a that's a larger scale I mean yeah I had\nThe opportunity to watching of course with some amazing

music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so your booth operating at a level where many of the artist you worked with huge big names and know exactly what the ones I\nCan think can be a specific example where you have to navigate accommodating on holding on to create a vision and I knew him and you say that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points ... somebody one who's going to be a little bit differently and does yeah\nYou got on Dan initially in the beginning it wasn't that way 'cause I mean I have to put myself in being a woman in the industry and competing with of course jumps going to lead to cut the male dominated field and that ... the editor crops are starting off\nOn television so I was a pretty parts and that now want it to to be the girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I can do that only weapon I had was every time you get the opportunity\nYou have to knock it out the park the first ever project that I did one official project and I did music video with the music video for an award ceremony at I was the\nOne of them and they had a song that was going to be the theme song and then they had a lot of the big names pitching for it\nAnd I'm like you know what do you do not like you know I'm a direct analogy but yeah I mean what we want you to that when you come out of the stage and things like that\nAnd I mean I'm not just from one they had one day I had a dream about the concept tries to be a visual\nAs possible and I sent it to the guy that you know who's running the show and he called me up like actually love this treatment and bite off your like that's the I call it that is one and I need to make a decision that popped into my head you know what how 'bout you do this\nHow about you don't pay me give me just what I Need to execute the project and you get a better job because of course you're gonna have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point I caught that shock eventually\nTo position myself I didn't want them heritage that I knocked it out the part I might not have gotten a lot more books that tuition but that it's the only part of that and I had to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a bigger part of you know a lot of people call me they don't even though I'm a girl so [laughter] because they didn't see the music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nLike I can talk about how much you're charging [laughter] I'm very expensive very kind of you on hold again if you don't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you're charging a fence it depends on the project\nThat things I saw the ad that things are charging dollar um ... ... they're probably like I'll give you figured that project so that I Do\nFor nothing at all but that would have made me the money when they came to me my budget or the little bit too much for them I really loved the the project I wanted to be part of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in that particular project might not have\nLied my pocket at that point in time when I was probably made me the most money down the line because people are seeing that and gone I needed to work in this project right drawn out somewhere\nAnd they figure they're going to be given that they can get\n... now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much she or challenging\nAnd it's funny because actually my family has not increased [laughter] because at that as a rule of thumb that older actors get temp Senate budget isn't what would be typical\nBudget I mean you can give me an example of the budget or we took him out of hand\nThat as a rule of thumb that older actors get ten percent of the budget is what\nWould be typical budget I mean can you give me an example of a budget or we took him out of hand hundred thousand US soldiers are we talking about ten thousand US dollars\nIt can be that it can be either hum let's say a low budget project is around ten thousand oh\nAnd that means that director would get a thousand dollars but that would be like a month's work\n... you would get more working at a supermarket [laughter] because a matter of hours you put into a project where you drop everything and they actually just do that you're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can you end up with a little bit of caution you pocket\nUh
