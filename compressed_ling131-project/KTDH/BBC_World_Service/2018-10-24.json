G the Saudi authorities now have to deal with some stinging criticism from ... back to the U.S\nPresident Trump says the Saudi explanation of events amounted to in his was the worst cover up in history his was the president's speaking ... to the White House\nThey had a very bad original concept\nWas carried a poorly and the cover up was one of the worst in the history of cover up for a simple bad deal should've never even thought of somebody really messed up and they had the worst cover up ever\nAnd where should have stopped is at the deal standpoint whether they thought about it because whoever thought of that idea I think is in big trouble [noise]\nAnd they shouldn't be in big trouble\n[noise] Mr Shirky was murdered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul which is joining the Turkish government to do the dispute for reaction up and speaking to the former Turkish opposition MP I kind of near now with the foundation for defense defense and democracy ... think tank in Washington present the idol one\nPromise offers revealing the naked truth\nOr was unfulfilled or there was an editorial in the Washington Post are criticizing ad on a for a exploiting the crisis for political gain but nevertheless ah the spectacle a you know add on announcement and then um you know to live\nA broadcast all his group meeting contribute to an increase in global pressure increase in global awareness about the issue and potentially as of today Washington has started responding\nNow the Trump Administration is moving to revoke visas of Saudi Government officials have intelligence agents suspected of being involved\nIn the killings were seeing the fruits measures at unit of measures again some a high ranking Saudi officials how do you think this might affect things going forward do you think the Saudis will just accept this is part of the outcome of what has happened from ...\nTo ... for you this is still an acceptable scenario or we will probably continue to see further action against other Saudi individuals and potentially again some institutions uh\nAnd uh they will not be limited to these restrictions or we might see a global Magnitsky a big nations pitching in\nSo the use going to be represented ... Australia's with saloon notably no to invite you to sit with the cool kids though a China and the United states of the two biggest economies in the well I Do not going to talk about global trade with them\nI'm curious what men so I spoke to independent research and stuff and he had a dog to what exactly needs reforming about the WTO\nThat three main plane so at first it they want to improve the efficiency ineffectiveness of monitoring system they've got a hundred and sixty four countries around the world all trading together really difficult to keep an eye on what's happening now right everything's technical now\nAnd that brings us into the second point which they need to modernize trade rules for the twenty first century so we're talking everything from digital trade\nTo international investment to state owned enterprises that code for China by the way um and the third thing is that they want to safeguard and strengthen the dispute settlements system to right now it's really tedious\nLengthy and inefficient to try to resolve disputes between countries\nWhich is why we're in the current situation we're in which is that the United states and China are breaking the world Trade Organization rules and having their own private trade war at the moment that started this summer and it's not great because it floats the WTO rules in which case why should the other one hundred sixty two members follow them\nOf all these people that are meeting in Canada obviously with trying to win\nThe WTO rule in which case why should the other one hundred sixty two members follow them\nAll these people that are meeting in Canada obviously with trying to in the United states not being invited to the world's two largest economies so her going to work it\nSounds like a disaster and not have them there but at the same time I might be really inefficient to have them there at this early stage so one of the things we could see as a negotiating strategy is that\nThese Thirteen stakeholders are joining Canada for this today ... have ideas come up with some solutions and then present them to the to feuding party and says look\nThis is a nice basis for discussion what do you think what do you like and it really takes something on the disposition and personality and great and insurance\nOf the people who are committed to multilateral trade to keep doing that I mean that this is diplomacy state craft and the stuff that Canada frankly it's very good at\nRight in the European Union is very good at it the United states used to be very good at it but under US President Donald Trump we've seen him wants to renegotiate the north American free trade agreement\nWhich has recently done and he took that right to the wire he pulled out of the Paris or he didn't want to sign up the United states the Paris climate accord he doesn't like international agreements and he says complaining that the United states spend too much on NATO for instance which isn't true by the way but he likes to say that and to paint the United states has a victim\nChina similarly also is saying you know we're really happy to be part of the world Trade Organization but we are really against we oppose\nAnything that's got penalize our state owned enterprises because that's a huge part of how they operate one\nOf the main functions of the WTO they have a lot of ... they're looking at international trade the U.S has actually been withholding appointments to various different tunnels\nWell this is so you've got the United states and the one hand saying that you know\nWe're going to withdraw if the WTO to shape up and then on the other hand making it really difficult for the world Trade Organization to function by blocking the appointment of judges right who who do all of the education so that sounds inconsistent they would say that this is part of the way of forcing the issue\nForcing the negotiation and we saw the former head of the world Trade Organization amending ... say say what you like about Donald Trump by\nHim wanting the trade war with China and threatening to withdraw the United states he has done what many people that needs to be done which is to reform the WTO\nThat was independent research it's definitely\nYeah quite an undertaking there tell me thanks [noise]\n\nThe last few days you'll be familiar with the caravan of thousands of migrants heading from Central America towards the U.S they reach Mexico now gaining numbers in attracting political controversy as they go\nThe size of the group is growing from around a thousand to more than seven thousand according to the United nations estimates President Trump has turned the caravan into a major domestic us political issue to accusing the migrants are being criminals among other things\nFor their part the migrants said many of them are parents with young children seeking a better life away from the violence and the lack of ... ... in their home countries one of those in the carbon it's twenty nine year old Jose got mad at Clinton ya from Honduras and he's been speaking to news day about why he's on the move\n\nI'm twenty nine years old ... for me it's been three years but I was a joke it's ...\nIt's a sacrifice and sometimes I didn't have money to get tiny foods I'm truly scares or if I'm honest I'm afraid because this journey is not easy for me this is the first time leaving 'em ... fear but when I remember the necessity we have about just forces me to continue\nAnd for me this is the first time leaving and I have a ... fear but when I remember the necessity we have not just forces me to continue and even if I Would like to go back I don't\nKnow because of their retaliation that the Honduran government has promised us sing with anyone who returned home during his risks jail for an up to four years no that isn't my fear my fear to starving to death that's my fear the only thing I Hope it's Mr Donald Trump opens the doors to us that sense\nBecause it's been too much sacrifice to get there an end up with nothing we're not going to steal from him we're not going to do anything that would be by God's Grace but he can help us\nAt ... or ... ... ... ah well I've been talking to Daniel Lipman a reporter for the political news site in the U.S and I asked him how he saw President Trump would react and he said who is your story\nI guess I Would say that the president he makes the case then you can't be allowing millions of people from desperate countries because you enter a border ... and then you know when does it kind of stopped and so I think you know Trump was elected primarily\nA in some cases a on a anti immigrant platform in twenty sixteen and so he's carrying out his voter promise to stop illegal so I said that we should have a heart with immigration policy but he doesn't always carry that out in terms of\nShowing for people who are clearly plane desperate situation\nThat sort of a policy line his rhetoric and so on clearly plays very well to his base with these midterm elections approaching sauce do you think it works with the rest of the country particularly perhaps undecided voters\nI think a lot of moderate voters they don't like when Trump uses false statements to back himself up when he was talking about you know unknown middle Easterners\nIn a way in America where a pluralistic society and so a lot of suburban Americans were moderates they don't want to use this type of you know racially motivated\nFear mongering that is not even true and you know\nI think it just doesn't appeal to his small sliver of his base which is still in about thirty percent of Americans but for Democrats for independence for even moderate Republicans you know whatever Trump says on the caravan or immigration policy in general\nThey are do not approve of him or they don't want immigration policy to run out of the country by a Steven Miller who is very hard right anti immigrant\nA senior policy adviser to\nPresident Trump has also included said Democrat caravan tried to pin the blame as they were on the Democrat is is a topic that the Democrats than just simply trying to avoid in the run up to the midterms or conversely I wanted to kind of ... most possibly\nHelp them in the sense that it might motivate that base perhaps evening courage Hispanic votes is to come out and vote for them\nA great point I think and Democrats that don't want to be talking about this issue because no political party has a great answer to immigration policy and we've both presidents of\nDemocrats and Republicans they have tried to tackle immigration reform and they've been stopped a in various efforts and some Democrats want to be talking about health care and economy and Trump's character a and investigating the president they don't want to be talking about immigration but\nIn all this effort to split the\nUh and investigating the president they don't want to be talking about immigration but really the effort to split the country and I jumped in terms of what this is a democratic caravan when a these types of ... I've been happening for the last couple of decades has\nDaniel it and then with the Politico a news site\nIt's called little coverage in its uh on the BBC Web sites a beach new so called a ... a video made by a correspondent highly ... that Trump and the facts about the migrants caravan sort of fat check facts check some of the things Donald Trump has been saying about those thousands of people making their way up to the U.S border\nAnd that's in the U.S are us and Canada page um BBC and use them at BBC dot com forward slash needs at the photo stay tuned ... coming up in the second half of this hour we're going to Canada because after days of legalizing\nMarijuana it's reportedly running out I'm gonna try to find out why [noise]\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.
