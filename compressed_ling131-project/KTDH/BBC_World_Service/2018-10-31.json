when he was elected two years ago\nNever offered any evidence for that claim but often the election he did set up a commission to investigate election integrity from votes cost to folks have registration forms\nThere's no actual or real verification done by election officials once they get that for them to make sure that for example it's a real person\n... is a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation a think tank in Washington DC and he was a member of the president's commission\nAnother example of the problems is there's a question on the form that says are you in the United states citizen and there's lots of evidence that non citizens are illegally registering and voting because again that's not check\nThat's a problem and is the problem that in many states you don't have to show any id to vote you simply walk into a polling place\nGive them a name and you get to vote\nAnd you know what your opponents say about you they tell you that you are stirring up a specter for problem where there was really a problem how you respond to that\nWhile I respond to that by citing an opinion from the United States Supreme court which is our highest court of law back in two thousand eight what the Supreme Court said is that the United states has a long unfortunate history of voter fraud it's been documented by historians and journalists\nAnd it could make the difference in a close election I don't think anybody disagrees that if you have a national election where the margin of victory as tens of millions of votes\nIt would take an awful lot of fraud to change that and us probably unlikely but we have many many elections in this country particularly at the state and local and city level and many of those elections are decided by just a handful of\nVotes ... therapeutic in the southern states but not only in the southern states a long history of focus oppression and what your political opponents say it the sign of measures that you're talking about fixing to unfortunate Patton voted suppression\nNo they don't that's their convenient are scapegoating of them in order to oppose them requiring everyone to show an ID when they vote is no way going to suppress votes\nIn fact it's a bit patronizing I think and frankly borders on racist to believe that for example African Americans don't have the ability to get an ID the way white Americans do or Asian Americans\nBut many African Americans only spoke to in North Carolina took a different view especially since the state's voting little was ruled unconstitutional\nThe appeals court said it was written with discriminate street intent to impose cute it's a problem that did not exist and targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision tons if he could understand why African Americans might be skeptical\nOh I can understand why they would think that but it's not true the whole point of what the those who were suing said was this is going to depressed turn out the number of African Americans voting will go down the exact opposite happened in fact a African American turnout was a record in the state\nAlready them and is a senior reporter for Mother Jones magazine\nIn fact a African American turnout was a record in the state already\nBooming is a senior reporter for Mother Jones magazine and author of the book give us the ballot the molten fight for voting rights in America he's not a tool convinced that any of us should be worried about voter fraud I think it's a very\nSmall problem and one that has been exaggerated I think that you see cases here are cases there\nThere might be a county here or a county fair where it's very problematic but the kind of widespread fraud where president Donald Trump says three million people have voted illegally that just doesn't occur and so I I think there\nHas been a pretty committed movement of people on the conservative Republican side of the aisle who have exaggerated that threat for political purposes and had made it seem a much more widespread in severe than it actually is\nBut if you accept as a problem with voter fraud even if it's possible and spread out truly need to do something about it\nI think it's a very very very small problem and there are targeting solution to the problem but I think rewriting all of American election laws is not a targeted solution\nA lot more people have been prevented from voting than fraudulent votes cast that there are many many more people that are being blocked from the polls that\nHave voted illegally and I think you have to scrutinize all of those cases very clearly to see if if there were actually fraud and and there's been a lot of really wild claims that had been made by people like Hans von Spakovsky so the bigger problem\nIs that a lot of people can't participate in the election or choose not to or to sway from participating\nBecause of barriers that have been erected\nTo the ballot box of what evidence do you have that they actually do\nI think there's been a lot of study there's been um numerous studies that have found for example that\nVoter ID laws reduced voter turnout and that they reduce voter turnout most sharply among young voters first time voters voters of color these are studies that have been done by\nAcademics in states like Wisconsin these are studies that have been done nationally by government agencies and places like Kansas and Tennessee I think if you look at the intent\nOf Republicans have claimed many different Asian or that these laws have helped them politically that have helping carry key swing states like Wisconsin for example I and\nI think it also it just makes sense that you know if you reduce people's access to the process that fewer people that are going to participate\nBut also the last election in North Carolina the state board of elections did a careful review and they found ... five hundred cases of people voting you shouldn't have isn't that evidence of vote to froze I all Ari\nIf you look at the case the frog that were uncovered most of the time they were ex felons\nDidn't realize they're an eligible to vote there are people that had already served their time and they were on probation or parole and they thought they were eligible to vote when they cast a ballot 'cause there was a very very steep price to pay when you're talking about potentially a facing ... years
