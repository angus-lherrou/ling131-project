an immigrant I came to the u._k. when I was five and a growing up I I had heard about this story and it just became more residents to me and it struck me that very few people knew about\nWhether they were all ethnic minority origin or or Asian or Indian or whether they were purchased a meaning a white person\nIn terms of a story she was a Muslim sissy pacifist she was born to an Indian father an American mother and she was actually a children's writer in Paris than when World War two broke out her family moved to the u._k.\nAnd she voted for the women of apples um two years later she was picked up by the special operations executive which was a special unit crisis by Winston Churchill\nAnd she was the first female ready to operate a to B infiltrated into any enemy occupied France aged just twenty nine years old so essentially she was part of an intelligence unit yes yeah I don't like when the nine\n... and one of the leading ones because what happened was that could stop a doctor to round up um their spy network\nAnd she was she was she and she was adjusted to come back to the u._k. but she did not want to ban that have French colleague without communication so she stayed and she singlehandedly that's Indian woman a pacifist a Muslim sixty she ran afoul of agents by herself\nSaving countless of lives and the sad thing is she was captured by the Nazis she was tortured and

to handle the crisis it took us far too long to diagnose disease and responded appropriately Walsh school of economics that actually did that is how to handle the crisis as old fashioned games in economics\nAnd a number of people made that point but then people recommend that fiscal stimulus in the face off a deep recession\nThey weren't using the frontier economics with a guy that got starting graduate schools they were using stuff that if you remember it from the undergraduate days yeah so the economics of the cities\nThat wrote it better than the economy of the eighties nineties and the early to says\nThe financial crisis highlighted the extent to which what was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them with the head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy with students were with the mismatch between what they were learning in close what we're seeing on the news as supposed banks and then the whole financial system began crashing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning this in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economic times it's a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimension to the crisis\nAnd Christian that's where the good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that knocks off is\nFact that students around the world continue to be too close\nAnd the students having to say well we're actually not covering that knocks off is\nThe fact that students around the world

used university textbooks in retrospect she admits these books missed on subjects that we usually important in terms of understanding the crash\nThings as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomic textbooks which we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy side or the one published in\nTwo thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics is taught in universities around the world\nAnd has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think this was true or not just the opposite of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate and going to steal the financial systems in which we will depend if they get bad advice can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration felt by students and their teachers around the world has given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others are building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionate about\nAnd so I have to put my own hand up here I chose the core charity\nBut

definitely a problem it is very very shocking they remain really fantastic early in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end ignoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flooding incentives and all that deception and fraud and all the excessive\nEndangerment that's entirely unnecessary it's just taken is given it's just what they said the system and does she think this has changed following the crisis\nWhat you hear is more and out you know very shockingly you know stuff happens then you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big groups at

of move on and say well I did my\nBest can prevent it stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economist could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going

conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true\nI think it would be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices\nBut somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives that Mitch used his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained\nMarkets often don't work the reason that this will hand often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of an invisible hand and supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys them selves things and the self interest and trades freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust sticking that's one of the Nobel Prize for economics by them to find some of the ways in which the cue Simpsons about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just that somebody know something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes at in Dr needed their students the markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\n\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem at the heart of economics
