outlook\nGoing into the final week of the midterm campaign people are very concerned about what's going on and this affects people's outlook towards the state of the country\nAnd Lee has the Republican Party come to terms with a Trump presidency I mean across the Republican policy\nWell I think it's interesting 'cause there there there was a note Trump burst for quite a while they have pretty much vanished\nI think it's fair to say that this is Donald Trump's party when you look at the votes for key legislation you look at what Republicans are saying at worse they say well you know he's got some odd characters things that I Wish she didn't talk about so much or tweet about so much of the agenda I'm really solidly behind\nThere's very few Republicans who are distancing themselves\nA horror facing election right now or reelection from Donald Trump I mean they they are really you know stepping in lied to his administration and his presidency\nI was gonna say if I may it there is relatively little difference in polling data between people who identify as Republicans and people who tell us that they voted for Donald Trump\nIt's not as if one group is any different from the other on in terms of their political views what we find is that Republicans in particular are taking their cues\nFrom President Trump and while they may not have an opinion that matches his when an issue first emergent\nAfter a week or two they do in fact echo the Trump position so we've got Donald Trump effect is leading the party and leading those people who who voted for him two years ago\nOn if I also can add something about we've had shootings in the United states we had a lot of mass shootings over the years it does relatively little in the long run in terms of changing opinion about gun control about what to do about gun violence\nOn there's usually a short term effect but it it dissipates in in us surprisingly short amount of time a week or two so this coming ten days before the election it's sort of hard to see whether or not it's going to have any meaning to voters when they go to the polls on next Tuesday\nAnd caffeine what about Republican women because there are lots of things about what this president is alleged to have done to women and the things he says about women which might outrage women even if they are loyal to the Republican Party\nI've spent a lot of time over the last few weeks looking at the relationship between gender and partisanship and how that affects opinion\nAnd what seems to be the case is that Republican women and Republican men don't differ very much when it comes to opinion about Donald Trump they did not differ when it came to opinion about\nSupreme Court justice now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh where we see gender differences emerged and be very distinctive is among those people who identify with neither party on independent women are very different from independent meant\nYeah and I I Would add to that or you just clearly more about party than it is about gender when do you accept you know back critical group of voters and the basis of both parties are pretty much lock stock and barrel behind her party's candidates that leaves these independent voters and especially independent women\nAnd independent women who may be in the living in the suburbs\nWho are the ones who are if there is a swing group that's probably the group of voters that to zero in on\nWell then let's finish by talking about the Democrats we report quite a lot about\nThe group of voters that just went on\nWell then let's finish by talking about the Democrats we report quite a lot about changes in the Democratic party a much more progressive voices the kind of establishment Clinton nights really losing the influence how do you see that ...\nYou know [laughter] I think there were a couple of primaries that sort of guide some headlines I'm not sure that we have\nAnything that's clear looking ahead to let's say twenty twenty at this point\nOther than there's a lot of mobilization among the Democratic party I don't think Democrats have certainly pick sides as to which part of them is going to dominate the process I think the unified in their opposition to President Trump to this point ...\nIf the Democrats take control of the house of representatives um it's very likely that Nancy Pelosi will continue to be\nThe leader of the party in the house and she has certainly identified as one of the old guard on the other hand you know I'm from a woman which is a distinction that may prove valuable in terms of her contest for house speaker if the Democrats taken Trump\nJust a short also from each of you or how likely is it that the Democrats will take the house or even the Senate Lee\n[noise] well I think you know the ... and I suspect cats will agree with that I mean the conventional wisdom maybe right this time I can agree on how it's like to go democratic in the Senate it's like to stay Republican\nIs very likely that the national house vote is going to be clearly in favor of the Democrats but the way districts are drawn that may or may not result in a Democratic majority in the house of representatives the Democrats have a terrible time trying to reach a majority in the Senate\nJust because there are too many vulnerable red state Democrats who were on the ballot this year\nAnd and very few Republicans who as I see that the that Hillary Clinton carried the reverse doesn't hold its just as all the Democrats are said the Trump carried\nLabor and golf director of the Marist College poll and the\nCafe Frank of it and then and then holding an election consultant you'll have your own views you might have your own votes let us know on Twitter at BBC than them and I really would like to know of course\nHe'll have full coverage of the run up to the votes and the result here on the b._b._c. was seven [noise]\n\nAnd you're listening to weld updates from the BBC the
