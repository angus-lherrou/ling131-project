S. that you had to participate if you are public broadcast or private broadcaster for that matter ... so if you are one of the primary channels for your city or your region you would be um made to carry a message or the or more just yet where it would go off\nAnd they would say this is a message from the White House stay tuned for more information stay on this channel\n... and they would they would do tests so Americans with ... with the sound but that would be told that it's just a test of the system as the on the emotions you Brokaw system\nYes there was a required a monthly test and some places the weekly test as well but often you know it was at midnight or a little bit later so I'm a lot of people found out by when they knew that on the couch or it would make them up in a very ...\nThat sounds like a cultural thing this is a trunk the Americans none of the site America wouldn't know that is that's a great detail I Love that [noise] so do people talk about this\nThere's been this rising tide of awareness where people are realizing that this is something that's going to happen this is coming straight to everybody and I think the part that's really getting people burn is the fact that it will say it will be labeled at the top of the the text message that arise as presidential alert\n[noise] yeah I'm a social media message from President Trump um that wouldn't be confusing would ditch [noise]\nUh no I think at some point or another\nThat is what everyone is fearing is that the system will be taken away from its original purpose and that will suddenly get an emergency alert to the entire nation that says no collusion but there are also to road blocks I think that having that happen right the first one is that is legal they did set this up to say\nThere is a way to use this is only for emergency situations and anything else especially politically would be illegal now a lotta people say well maybe that doesn't slow you down the legal part won't stop someone who has already done so much to a scandal eyes that country\nUm but the actual activation procedures it would go from the White House in in Trump's authority only but the procedures would be handled by FEMA so the officials there would have a modicum of oversight to say the least I don't think that it would be like his Twitter account were hit on constrained access to any\nTime right so it is slightly unfiltered by the emergency management um uh people are presumably Yukon reply to this tax\nWrite and [laughter] I I Want to think of what would happen if someone else took control of the system though and sent some message either in farce or in you know ... to the entire country\nIn the wrong moment right that that would be a a worse situation almost than having a real message come through a at an untimely time\nYeah reply old would lead to trouble wouldn't it address to see any of the ... center at the Harvard Kennedy School I'd just to spoil the or anticipation that message are we going to get says this this is a test of the national while this emergency alert system no action is needed that coming from the you know are we going to get all caps slump\n... says this this is a test of the national while this emergency alert system no action is needed but coming from the you know are we going to get all caps luck for example well this is this is the thing I'm I'm ah in fact what what to enter and other people are\nInterested in Aden is the kind of the fact that many people who have a ... not to do to the current occupy of the White House will just come and go\nI don't want to Mr the president is going to ignore it even when it could be quite important uh likewise if somebody else we're in the White House the other half of America would possibly avoid it as well as he was saying um it just feels as the president count really send a personal message but bear in mind that these folks alarms do actually happen to remember Hawaii that\nThere was lots of ... there was a a a false along with a ballistic missile attack which went home for thirty minutes before the pug was actually pulled the noise by the way I'm quite pleased we play it she was playing it on my computer\nWhen I came in and suddenly the whole office was looking at me is that screeching and unpleasant you wanted 'em ... thank you very much in the ... already got twenty pounds to fourteen twenty\n\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S has made possible by American public media producer and distributor of award winning public radio content\nHow can you make sure that you target the right people that you get people to the numbers of the people you need to get hold off to cover a broad enough uh sway the community for example\nThat yeah that's very good question so these days numbered actually not a problem because like I can imagine so many people have mobile phone even in a little league are studying like Liberia urban even rural areas of Liberia but they're still an issue because the people who use mobile phone\nMight be of course a little bit different than people who don't inside and so we had to use some\nMash and techniques after the nature of the pie some and look at some samples from the people that data from from the mobile phone to make sure that makes sense for the you know the larger population\nYeah 'cause I can imagine in a place like Liberia there's some pretty remote rural places where people either don't have a cell phone network maybe in some cases people who are illiterate maybe some of the people who need to help most are the ones you find the most difficulty and reaching\nYeah no that's of course they're important especially in these situations so we have to be a kind of put in a little bit cinematic we meaning the lenders for example over sample and places where it's more under developed there'll be less at\nThat and then we took a cat into account characteristics of people not just um what they were finding in terms of their health care but you know what they're since your economic were and other things to make sure we're getting information on it and good a distribution of you know thinking about going to teach in the population\nAnd I wonder about these text messages because in ... in many places it seems to me the ... the tax to the way of getting information around quickly\nYeah exactly you know these kinds of things are always changing what people are using for Arctic\nTechnicians were okay make really good you know samples people\nBecause it's still possible for people to get text messages sent me given incentives so people answering the survey they would get some amount of air time they'll that and it was a little bit and send it to respond to that you've been definitely people you know I think in terms of research exploring these different modes like what's that other kind of\nA new technologies would be important to augment you know our ... our public health efforts as well\nAs ... as she says yeah the idea is that it can be used it all the crises\nThe globe as well on the way we talk about the green Sahara a fundraising period in history\nAnd how humans are back then this is tens of thousands of years ago ... clever than humans now at managing deserve suffocation also he'll just say that report on the way and also we go to Texas as well so it looks to come plus the sport but now we're going to cost to the states we're going to talk to one of the journalists behind\nThe big story in the New York times and in the American media which is an investigation into President Trump's family and the ... schemes which greatly benefited the president of the report talks about some Donald Trump receiving large amounts of money from his parents are nothing wrong with that of course as you were about to hear\nA but it's sort of contradicts the image that was presented to being a self made man to obey started with a million do those those are his words not mine\nA President Trump's lawyers has ... ah I've responded to the times story saying the allegations\nOf fraud and tax evasion all one hundred percent photos\nAnd highly defamatory or so for the president has broken with the practice of past presidents and has refused to release his tax returns there's programs ... spoke to one of the journalists who ...\nPresident has broken with the practice of past presidents and has refused to release his tax returns there's programs I mean 'cause you just spoke to one of the journalists who have the story David Boston\nAs if it reveals too important glance one is it reveals that the central narrative\nThat Donald Trump has told throughout his life and especially in his political campaign for the price of of the narrative that she is a self made billionaire who basically started with a million dollar loan from his\nFather and turned it into this incredible Baldwin park but that narrative that is actually completely at odds with the record itself that we on the earth no record of many tens of thousands of pages of documents from any side the real estate empire of Fred Trump the father of the president\nAnd that record shows in fact\nThat Donald Trump threw out his life he's deeply dependent upon\nHis father's financial support starting from the age of three and that that support continued not just through his adolescence\nAnd into is adulthood that actually you know into his forties or fifties he was being paid anywhere from five six seven million dollars a year from his father his financial empire\nOne wants to be what's wrong with that I Do my money once in a while\nYeah notice there's absolutely nothing wrong with parents supporting their kid the part where there is something wrong is that the amount of money that Donald Trump received from his father was significantly increased by a series of tax ... very legally dubious tax schemes\nMarks on the borders are we talking about ...\nTalking about tax evasion tax avoidance\nTax evasion is illegal and what we discovered was the Trump family for example created a sham corporation can disguise large cash gifts\nFrom Fred Trump to his children as if they were a legitimate business transactions when in fact they were a\nBunch of the tea or that Trump's lawyer has denied this\nAnd the basically the ... optical ... story\nThey have said that a ... by should remind your listeners as well I Would encourage your listeners please\nTo read the story for themselves you actually will see that we made available to reverse the source documents that we used to reach some of the conclusions that we reached tax returns invoices banking records checks it's all there because of course\nIt's important for us especially at a time and so much of the media is sort of accused of fake news to kind of show our map\nAnd yet it's very likely that he's he's he's going to push the button dismisses Laurie is some little pot is a company that gives them I\nI think that that's unfortunately true in this very tribal allies age that we live in\nThat same above so one of the journalist involved in that report in New York Times speaking to I like to see John ... children on
