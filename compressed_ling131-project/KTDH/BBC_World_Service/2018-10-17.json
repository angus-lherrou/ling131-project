for another ... should Fortnite it's a collaborative shoot 'em up survival game essentially\nIt's also a big money generator and now the creatures epic games are becoming one player Brandon Lucas who it's posted videos online on how to cheat while playing the game [noise]\nSo how big of a problem is that when the online video get within the online video game industry let speak to Ellie gets in video games journalist who joins us in the studio great to have you with is Ellie\nJust before we get into the the the problem with Brandon Lucas [noise] we we say that it's a it's a huge game for I'd I don't play but I've heard of it how was it a global and a big money generator you don't you don't make any money playing it do you make any money buying it to play it\nWell you don't have to ... to pay any money to play the game of dominoes again I think one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to lots of people if you want you can buy a thing ... seats in politics about maybe ten dollars\nAnd that gives you access to so cooler weapons and guns and outfit and that sort of thing um but yeah it's not really a a money generation gave in that sense you have to pay a subscription or anything like that\nBut obviously lots of people have super into the game and willing to buy that season ... how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted on line there and why the company at the games it's suing that\nPlayer Brandon Lucas so you have to find them Lucas is accused of making the tax to the game and selling them\nAnd these are enabled prior to cheat by ... the he's maybe ... ... ... it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim at them dumped it for you automatically\nSo he's been selling these molds to the game online\nAnd put up with the two hundred pounds in some cases wow and yet and people are buying those people are buying them yes because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people have got the money to rent that these kinds of things but over the knowing for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating and of course\nThe the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is that essentially we're talking about hacking into the software ... uh Fort Night\nThat's right that basically accusing the paper of copyright infringement that saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that you have ... essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one that surely at the games should be targeting everyone who does\nWell this is in fact it's argument is that he's being singled out he believed at some fat he says they're not some notes of other people doing this you know why they picked on him\nUm and you know I think epic haven't been there about the only thing they would probably argue that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to stop somewhere and ... that trying to demonstrate with this case that if you do this this is what the consequences will be\nAnd it's this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nI Know if it's not even a fuss for Fortnite rated I vote yeah they they had some people arrested I think and I'm a this is a different game actually paranoid festival grounds and that I have to be arrested in China for hacking the game [noise] um yeah and an historically it's been going on for years it's always been cheating and games\nAnd like many thanks Eli gets in their video games journalist joining us life\nHas been shooting and all sorts of games um thank you Eli I understand a bit more now\nTwenty two minutes possibly a about Canada has just become a\nThe second country to fully legalize recreational marijuana full consumption I'm Sorry you regard was first\nEven a fast food night rainy day but yeah they they had some people in a restaurant I think in um uh this is a different game actually paranoid about two grounds and that it has to be arrested in China for hiking the game\nUm yeah and an historic day it's been ... there's always been cheating games and like many things really gets in the video games journalist joining us life\nHas been shooting and all sorts of games um thank you Eli I understand a bit more now\nTwenty two minutes possibly a now Canada has just become a the second country to fully legalize recreational marijuana consumption on site Europe why was but the protests began a few hours ago it was midnight struck first Newfoundland and the eastern most parts of the country to be moving\nAcross to great celebrations Chris O'Neal yeah each of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was that in the provincial capital St John as midnight struck so who was setting the first batch\nIf a company called called canopy gross it's actually quite a large multinational company\nAnd uh they set up shop in St John so they will be selling it you know over the counter here um there are about three locations here in in St john's area that you can walk in off the street and by the candidate but\nFor for now for the most part\nYou'll be ordering it online it's controlled by the same corporation of government that control the sale of liquor\nAnd uh they've brought in older road regulation companies have to fly in order to be able to sell it legally there\nAbout twenty two locations off in a in the country right now that in ... in the province right now that can sell it and they will pay an excise tax the government so while it is regulated by government largely a lot of private companies\nTheir eye on this already and we got in for that if the companies that already um\nThat had already set down on\nWithout route than other parts of the world\nAnd I was the time zones move and midnight goes across the country or are we expecting the same sort of policy atmosphere it seems that you'll seeing the\nOh I Would I Would say so St john's there is a rather small city\nAbout a couple of hundred thousand people and saying this excitement tonight it's quite amazing so I Would imagine across the country if you look at large cities but really for people some of them are Canadians of one of them for very long time and uh when Justin Trudeau ran to be prime minister of the country he promised\nPeople he would take 'em take marijuana out of the hands of of of the illegal trade of the drug traffickers adds up\nAnd regulated in an attempt to to grow an industry and I guess a lot of people in the world right now we're looking at candidates and see what Canada is going to do because our way is the only other country in the world that\nHas a federal law that legalize cannabis the United states has done so in in a number of states and some countries have done is within safe but Canada it's really a leader\nA lot of people will be looking at houses\nHold it will not be without some that hiccup\nFrom law enforcement to actually whether there's even enough marijuana that the one thing we've been hearing of the last number of days that they expect that demand will be so great in the beginning that a lot of the flyers are probably going to run out even within the first few days\nRight is it because it's such a stampede or the basically the country's gonna be smoked empty do you think\nWell exactly that's what it will be but that people will have to take it and bring it home or take it in\nAnd look at it private because it's governed by the same rules as alcohol or smoking\nThat's Chris O'Neal Yates in St Joe Newfoundland or she was reporting there was a very ... behind hook you up for their legal kind of his uh for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation now\nGreat in the beginning that a lot of fires are probably going to run out even within the day\nAll right because it's such a stampede or the basically the country's gonna be smoked empty do you think\nWell exactly that's what it will be back here will have to take it and bring it home or take it in and look at it private it's governed by the same rules that alcohol or smoking\nAs Chris O'Neal Yates in St Joe Newfoundland uh she was reporting that was a a break Julie cue behind her queuing up for their legal kind of his uh\nFor the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\n[noise] now it looks like the cash will start flowing into the massive industry dam project in the Democratic Republic of Congo now that of fourteen billion dollar deal has been signed that David of our business asked is here with us now match is his third year old projects find any good at going to get off the drawing board and actually make some money\nBut then he looks like at the ... three hydroelectric projects has been delayed many many times but now deal has been signed\nLast year the deal the government almost two competing consult here to join forces the company that built the Three Gorges dam in China and Spanish Company called ACS and now it looks like a deal between the three ... prior to being penned\nAnd being money being delayed and it's had all sorts of needles I mean it's been a long time coming two years ago the world bank of froze the disbursement of Seventy three million dollars of aids cash that it was putting into a helpful technical assistance because it said\nThe country have taken the project in a different strategic direction than had been agreed\nTo tell us about the significance of the scale of it how they get it\nIt's a huge um I mean the only gift for the ... just three is to compliment the two existing power stations on the Congo river there about two hundred and sixty kilometers downstream from can shop near the NGO fold\nAbout those two power stations are pretty old no one was built in Nineteen Seventy two and one in Nineteen eighty two so this new project as well as the Jews are it's got sick phases and\nWe'll take more than ten years to complete complete it'll generate four thousand eight hundred megawatts of power now that's about the same amount of energy as three nuclear power stations China\nDoes the deer scene eater you that much power as\nWell as it doesn't but it means that the power supply in the deal she can be expanded way beyond the ten percent of the population who currently have reliable electricity supply which is of course great for economic growth\nIt'll be a boost for the country ... province in the southeast is where all the mining takes by some mining uses a great deal of energy\nAnd it also means the deal if he can be a big power exported to the rest of Africa not just its neighbors but as far south South Africa which has actually already signed an agreement to take power from the industry project\nHuge prospects then for the are the match many thanks ... and ... of our business desk joining us
