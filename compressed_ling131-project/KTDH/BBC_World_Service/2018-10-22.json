basically taxing and banks and insurances\nAnd on the spending side and talk and then there is any grazing talent to spend the term mainly pension and spend the church and also the so called basic

filling its promises to vote to sudden observing you resign and spending rules\nExactly exactly that's exactly the point I'm which is uh something that you know it's a big problem in Europe I think because the\nThe very fact that the governance he's an incomplete business and means that are still around the race go for a government that running something which is not in line with the European rules and that is a little you can do about it but to pull up to the country and to have such a new procedure eventually\nThey should be sanctions but so far sanctions have never been lied and or the process is he's a very long run\nIt could be argued do that um the government they need to do something to worry about the whole the economy and spending more for instance some infrastructure has the potential did it not to boost the economy\n[noise] yeah my point is that they really need to really an overall as you said about the on the supply side knocked on the demand equally does not need the support to them in\nUm I eat them you need some major reforms structural reforms to a better prepare the supply side to cope with the\nChallenges of the global economy is uh that imply some or a
