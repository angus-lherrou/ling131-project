good point because it seems to be easier this year to motivate people on the basis of fear\nThan it is to motivate them on the basis of satisfaction which is a strange thing for American politics

I Know we sold out at the moment\nI Know I Know but you know what they have nothing right now like it's very difficult for artists to go there and tour 'cause it's not worth it like in the economy side economy side but also people are afraid to go out during the night you know to concerts and so they try to make ... early during the day\nSo they don't have to be exposed to like you know at eleven PM leaving the theater\nSo yeah for me was also a surprise I was little doubt even the ones who didn't the night but yeah they're they're they're just like a craving for talent and for people to go and sing for them\nAnd when you are an all just from a country produce highlights you at the moment full suddenly all the wrong reasons mhm do you feel that sense of pressure to perform to writes about it to sing about who took to put some sort of message out there about the situation back home\nUh what color pressure at all I think it's something that we actually comes naturally\nThat we want to talk about it that uh as I said because my family's there I'm not I'm really far from the token I say that yeah from the situation because I talked to them everyday and they're living at you know so I think it's something that has happened now\nReally far from the token I say that yeah from the situation because I talk to them everyday and they're living at you know so I think it's something that has happened naturally fraud to talk about it or to express how we feel and it's more about missing\nMy family missing the beautiful beaches we have they're missing the fact that like if I Want to bring people to go on and and see where I'm from they they don't want to go because we're what they see the news and uh\nIt's not too pretty [laughter]\nUm so but yeah I I'm hopeful you know like I think things are going to get better because they have to you and people are very very brave and when I went last time people are working you know he was young people young people with a smile on their face\nJust very happy to be there and working for a better better Venezuela and that was very touching for\nMe and then the good times would smuggle redrawn and like\nI can get if you really have to visit it's not because I'm from their release you all go to bed yeah no I agree it's beautiful I think it's perfect the whether we have actually it's maybe Ninety degrees the whole year [noise]\nI Know it may sound bad for you but he's actually very uh it's amazing because we have to wind up ah the food each grade people are happy all the time every time I joke pictures to people there like what the hell are you doing\nHere [laughter] to me to mogul redrawn another is growing in London for the first time that you have to London jazz festival the twenty fifth of the budget some photo brings words from you both when it's an interesting you started to somebody\nPerforming abroad because she has to be ruled by and large reflections on family she's missing what's going on back home\nYeah ... what are the ones that are called murder to ensure when you're talking to her when I started to touch on the delicate political situation was the coded language yeah I remember that from the years with the military dictatorship in Brazil\nWas a coded language there are things that you wanted a pass or would you couldn't actually said yeah because we're afraid you're worried about what would happen to somebody exactly yeah she just got family there so she was a word yeah\nYeah I I think it's interesting that she said people to start for college for the courts or might cut I got ... mainly allies see I I actually have a friend living there and um I Can't understand that the concert was sold out so I agree with\nBoth of them and said well listen we're going to have a bit more of her music [noise] say thank you to both of you for joining his leisure time\nTo get I\n[noise]\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

to stop hurricanes we thought that we could use silver iodide too if you will sprinkle it over the hurricane and maybe stop the convection from happening\nThat didn't necessarily work for us and so we got more involved with trying to improve the forecast\nBy going over that started when people said oh a hurricane's coming is it just they tell by looking out the window and seeing black clouds\nPretty much so I mean it only got better for us\nWhen we had a satellites and that was around the early Nineteen sixties and it gave a sort of a picture of what was to come to our coats\nAnd

research into the realm of like her to the hiding started\nTo come up that is professor in electrical engineering and information technology at ... university book um\nWe were interested in seeing how far we could go in using the difference between human audio protection and machine audio perception because humans of course have some limits\nTheir perceptual ability\nFor example after a very loud sound human won't be able to proceed very quiet silent that free speech recognition system that's just the fame and there's other effects like that so not only can you not hear quiet sounds after an hour so that's also\nWhen you have a very loud sound wanted one frequency for example let's say you at the very very out fifty Ford's ... then you won't be able to hear a very quiet sounds like at

with embarrassed sounds I mean might be able to check up something like what about your voice them sort of like so have you\nYou have another example which involves an autonomous cars to join us

the hurricane season stunted his models with suggesting we were heading for something rather comma\nLet me issue me a ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly inactive Atlantic hurricane season and that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen those temperatures were not unusually warm\nWe were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event in debt usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that adverse for the\nFormation of these storms so for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got a new ... heat wave\nThis extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic that warm is what these storms\nFeed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical and some tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened even before foreign ... made landfall\nRabbit rage with scale for wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read ...\nAtlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an oceanic heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius so for a large part of the western Atlantic that warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you\nReally warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened even before Florence made landfall\n... raised with scale fool wins the Atlantic side clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these four cats in relation that we did which are very similar to a a global forecasts that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a mode participation overland after impact of the dorm with fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great the likelihood of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strength of the event has been changed\nYeah so what we're doing a slightly different than looking at what was the probability of at the vent to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and that we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the natural beauty and you can pin down the Pacific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that an estimated at part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic until they're warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecasts the initial education so that when we run these modified for cats with our climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that had on the atmosphere temperature as well as their temperature changes that have\nOn once you're in the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a change in the U.S that the we actually have a pattern change of the epilepsy that come from the fact that\nThe climate to him as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in that set up\nThese patents have geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak the ... the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic a\nPart of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start\nYou know decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that it actually included and it's set up\nThese patterns of geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak because the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the ... the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see a waltz do far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there's a very large region in the Atlantic the sort of marginal waters\nThat are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms and that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming that region where temperatures are high enough\nTo form those storms is actually expanding quite a bit it's expanded quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that is right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region\nIt's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier we're seeing storms turned into major hurricanes much\nFarther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well is marginal changes\nTo the Atlantic potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even
