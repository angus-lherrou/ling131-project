couldn't get him out because there are many people that that was a little bit shaky let that for me\nIt's there it's on page eight [laughter] it's eight minutes past seven GMT President Trump has confirmed that the U.S plans to withdraw from a key nuclear weapons treaty with Russia he said Moscow had repeatedly violated the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty\nWhat America had on a date Russia has denied those US claims so he's right President Trump pulled the Russians Daryl Kimball is the executive director of the arms control association that is a U.S based known punted on organization which promotes public understanding of arms control policies\nWhile the United states beginning in two thousand fourteen alleged in I Believe it's correct that Russia tested a ground launch cruise missile beyond the five hundred kilometer range limit allowed by the treaty and began to deploy a small number of these missiles\nThat they have an presumably that's the game and money talks and with so many people many countries desperate for an investment the Saudis have surplus money\nAbsolutely one of these investments and and you look at the trade between for example of Britain and Saudi those full point two billion dollars at ... pounds of of of the five billion dollars of of annual trade ... at\nThe trade but as as much in favor of the u._k. that translates into about a hundred thousand jobs in the u._k. as a result of trade with Saudi are we prepared to give this up and roasted price Rosen's\nWell why not tainted the thing I think by leaving me is that we and I'm willing to skate not or anything like that we have I Would argue I mean at somebody like in debt stand that anti midlife crisis leaving leaving ... and ... now and getting in finding that if all they have that\nAnd more dangerous friends and I think I'm willing to cross laptop come ... out of the leaving the biggest markets in the wild\nAbsolutely I mean if the ... the ultimate question is how much are the president will any other country wants to be the policemen of the world is this a wrong or is that is that to global responsibility and when we say global that includes Russia and China who work on the church has different set of values than we in the west operate on what though if\nMore images I mean clearly there is talk of more evidence emerging from turkey um if some reports the rights of some of that evidence could be extremely gruesome would that change things\nWith murder is always gruesome regardless of how to take space um and I think a ... the Turks have been politicizing the way they've been dropping and dripping information and then saying don't don't take this into account that's an authorized leaks so it's important to look\nAt a at the whole thing in context social she was murdered and he was a as a Saudi Arabia has said was murdered by at least senior officials and on and I think we just have to wait for the results of the investigation by the Saudis and how's the world would react to it\nAnd I could name I'm pro that when we knew what was happening in Yemen and they will still gathering and very happily and what what what do you think about that well\nI mean the Yemen crisis is is is another one you've got it it's it's not every subject that's operating there it's Iran with who says if the straits of of um of my rape in the south is Red Sea coast that's Fifteen Percent of global trade goes through the straits that means massive inflation that's going to affect us\nAll goes through there it's it's ... you know you could argue that Saudi has actually fighting the war of the west of war because of the south is news and the Iranians close the straits its house in the west who would be having to pay the price for it\nOne of the things we're told about why the west supports the Saudi regime is the sort of fragile and complexity of political settlement in the middle east what would happen if the west actually took the bold step of not propping up the Saudi regime\nWhat I mean that's what's happened in two thousand and three with Iraq and that led to the creation of faucets and we're still dealing with that I think it'd be much worse if the same thing is repeated with Saudi because it's not\nI think it would be much worse if the same thing is repeated with Saudi\nBecause it's not only to the extremists who wouldn't exploit this but to cheer extremist and done on your you have and then you've got the oil and um we have severe political and economic repercussions that will take many many years even longer than the Iraq War repercussions would still which will to dealing with no\nThank you very much into becoming mothers are actually some but as we look ahead to that event in Saudi Arabia this week it's a twenty

know line and try to some guy\nTime that that gun\nIn early two thousand sixteen we started doing smaller venues and little clubs around the United states\nThroughout the primaries and caucuses 'em and various debates and the ins and outs of the day to day news that I felt was worth addressing a little bit in our shows just so that I could introduce a song and say\nThis is dedicated to anyone who's not represent doesn't feel represented by the government and into the song and we'd get laughs in some places in other places would get like\nAn angry as years but the state of our shows just felt the atmosphere of of politics was unavoidable and different from any that you've experienced before a little bit I mean the fact that the news\nInvades our lives in a way that it didn't few years ago and certainly not Twenty years ago when I started doing these little clubs and things like that and yeah so I just started to feel like it would be great if\nSome of this stuff we could talk about it instead of just trying to find a clever introduction to a song and simultaneously Larry kind who I've worked with many times over the years had just started by saying you know let's come over here
