Steve how are you in ... because sometimes there really are ... I don't always ...\nFuller the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if that has something to say that they want to show in the video and then I have to take that into consideration okay Kenny\nI'd like to me somehow either from pitched you find them put up take what are you taking\nSo you know the game and that's all I go back I could listen to a song and immediately I teach matches on picture in my head like I just like steel frame and then I just have to do things together and sometimes it takes me a long time I got a you know please somewhat I'm brushing my team\nGot to play when I'm cooking when I'm drinking the why\nBecause the thing I'm trying to stay away from is\nThinking about the idea and it never works for me I don't think about the idea and then she would come to me in ways than one I'm thinking and that's why we have looked at when I'm speaking with a pen\nI just get up and I write it all down but then I'm going to forget as soon as I get up and I tried to make it as a visual as possible in words and then I found it to them and hundreds of a hundred\nThe article I Love that idea [laughter]\nA hundred percent I I don't know I didn't I didn't believe I Do have to that's that's what it is I shouldn't be about it and you know\nAnd then of course I think at some point the liberal hawks that come in and in my career boots off\nParts of the of course it gets to a point I was like okay this is what we need to do and I taught that this is what we need to do I because I'll be quick deposit I'm a bit parts in\nSecond to last me quintuplets in but we're not pension lawn cutting that like you have very passionate about it I can see I can take that I can feel it and do everything from but when you look at

also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening practice until you just can't you know it's ... you know I almost I guess yeah if you don't even have the lyrics anymore you just feel it [noise]\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if he can't the problem is sometimes you get a track and I like can you get the treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so\nThat's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market well maybe I'm just not as popular as director Comey but you know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors [noise] so that's a little trickier because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many hours I recently pitched on the cot is a ...\nAnd I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and\nI knew I was lucky just be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in a busy schedule I'm not sure they had time to talk to [laughter] so I just had to come up with an idea and cuts the best you know I didn't quite nail at that time but not support a band director is that\nThere is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success rate show [laughter] but maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artist and you ... it can potentially be more competitive out that because I Know there's a lot of direct it out there\nIs the biggest skill you if you're a fishing for me all the energy project [laughter] that's a that's a larger scale I didn't have\nThe opportunity to watching of course with some amazing artists but then I think I'm looking at the time to come to me that kind of made up their mind but then then again it's going to look beyond say\nYou're listening to the conversation like that so she would win a music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so you been operating at a level where many of the on she worked with on huge big names and know exactly what they want\nTo think can be a specific examples where you had to navigate accommodating ... holding on to create a vision and I knew him and you say that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points with somebody wanting something a little bit differently so just Indonesia yeah\nYou got on gun initially in the beginning it wasn't that way but I mean I put myself in especially being a woman in the industry and competing with all the junk going to medical male dominated field I'm not on the other crawl all starting off\nOn television so I Would put the person that no one at the to be the girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had was every time you get the opportunity\nTo knock it off the park the first ever project that I did one official project and I didn't mean to video or the music video for an award certain many that I Won the\n... and they had a song that was going to be the theme song on and they had a lot of the big names pitching for it and\nLike you know what do you do not like you know I'm directed not look I mean that's what I'll be watching his dad we come out of the things like that and I mean I'm not just for one thing\nYou know I Do not like you know I'm directing out like look I mean that's what I'll be watching his dad we come out of the things like that and I mean I'm not just from\nOne they had one day I had a dream about the concept tries to be as visual as possible and I sent it to the guy that you know who's running the show and he called me up like absolutely love this treatment and bite off your like that's the I caught one\nAnd I need to make a decision about called you know I think you know what how about you do this\nHow about you don't pay me give me just what I Need to execute this project and you get a better job because of course you're going to have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point I caught that chalk eventually\nTo position lights off at the heritage but I knocked it out the part I might not have gotten more books tuition but that it's the only part of an effort to pitch for it\nWell then one I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a bit in the hearts of you know a lot of people call me they don't even though I'm a girl so [laughter] because it took me the music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nOkay can we talk about how much you're charging [laughter] I'm very expensive what kinds of you on hold again if they are you didn't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you're charging\nA fence it depends on the project that things I charge denied that things are charging ... I'm ... ... they're probably like I'll give you the project so that I use that for\nNothing at all that without lead me the money when you came to me my budget or with a little bit too much for them I really loved the project I wanted to be part of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in\nThat particular project might not have\nLied my pocket at that point in time when I was probably made me the ... down the line because people are seeing that and gone I mean he's working this project right so that someone\nIs an ex because we're going to be given today I think I'm not going to get ... now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much you owe challenging\nAnd it's funny because actually my family has not increased [laughter] because it does a rule of thumb that older actors get temp set of budget is and what would be the typical\nBudget I mean you can give me an example of the budget we took him out of hand hundred thousand US dollars are we talking about ten thousand US dollars\nIt can be that it can be either hum let's say a low budget project is around ten thousand\nAnd that means that director will get a thousand dollars but that would be like a month's work so you would get more working at a supermarket [laughter] because a matter of hours you put into a project where you drop everything and literally just do that\nYou're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can you end up with a little bit of caution you pocket when you see the\nEvery year but knowing when do you can be complicated\nCertainly if you had somebody is you know six foot four and was like three hundred pounds you want to be very very careful how you wake that purse it up you have to be prepared to protect yourself\nOn the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News Monday morning beginning at five central [noise]\n\n[noise] this is Ninety One point five ... eighty nine point three Katie da da Silva supply planes public radio available everywhere at H.
