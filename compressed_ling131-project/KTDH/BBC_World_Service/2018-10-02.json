you know you can do it it's just\nDifferent activism work we do in within the conversation talking to the woman so it's it's a lot actually I go home holistic you just ask what was your big but I usually ask my patients do they have you eaten you know\nBecause she sometimes forget south yet ten kids and she\nHad been even eaten you know the you know she's feeling maybe she was starving more than twenty hours\nA day could could you take us into your clinic when a female patient walks in one of the things you've taken into consideration and come to light and everything\nThink for my last eleven years since I went back home my view it's completely change because I got my education from Russia and I spent several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality that you know family time and they said we should do and we push our patient as the paternalistic way of telling what to do what's right\nAnd one patient I had really she transformed my view and from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was complete\nAnd from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was completely change\nI had a patient who came to be the a leading in flood level was very extreme you didn't know in the condition in somebody we don't have blood

is just putting kind of life to risk just to save our children\nFrom that day on I just my views become more broader start listening an approach my patient more holistically where they come in from it's not only being in a physician who or training or what that time for my clinical skill and where\nI went to come back to some of the other cases and challenges you said take all the fence on cue point about your work focuses on the fact that men and women experience some diseases differently in court for a long because those treatments were designed for men not women went inside well\nScience has really been based on a very male model and that goes down to not only clinical trials but the early ways in which we do research so if you think about the cells that we use we don't pay attention to the sex of the cells if we look at\nThe animals we use in research\nThey are far more frequently and mail animals there's a real sense that using female animals makes research more difficult because they meant straight their menstrual cycle and that's the reality of women\nSo much of our science has been done on a male model and even when the laws changed in the United states\nIn Nineteen Ninety three to include women and late face clinical trials you're still dealing with the issue of the science on which the clinical trials with spaced being based on a male model [noise] and can you\nGive us an example of a disease that affects the ... different she\nLet me just give you heart disease which I'm a cardiologist we see and cardiac disease that women are more likely to have a different type of laying down a plaque or the hardening of those arteries and the heart\nThat tends to be more evenly laid out across the vessel which makes it more difficult to diagnose we now have the tools\nTo make the diagnosis the issue is that we don't understand why\nWe actually see that difference so if you don't understand\nWhy you see the difference question arises do we have the right therapy and I think those are questions that need to be asked there are other disorders where we're just beginning to understand some of the differences\nIn biology women are more likely to develop all timers women are more likely to develop depression\nTo understand some of the differences in biology women are more likely to develop all timers women are more likely to develop depression why is that we're beginning to see some studies\nBegan to point to differences in the biology but not yet something this actionable and I've only giving you a tip of the iceberg but the good news is that we are learning\nThese things but we still have a very long way to go now they could you working\nIn Somalia country that has seen almost two decades of civil war and up until recently there was no

confused and sometimes they can be guided back out to see about the discovery of sixty eight trivia wells dead on the shores of Scotland and Ireland in recent weeks\nSuggests a much bigger problem or to put it into context to get to a year is considered to be a normal figure here we have\nMore than sixty I've been speaking to us through brown the director of the Scottish marine animals stranding scheme\nThis is a little different to what we would normally see in in ... when the usual mortality events because I'm the conferences that are coming in a show of incredibly decomposed so\nUm we we actually had an investigating this lesson of pathology point of view and more from a sort of oceanographic aspect to try and work out why these animals have come from\nIt's not that they're being washed up and then they die that that when they reach the surface\nWhy these animals have come from\nSo it's not that they're being washed up and then they die that that when they reach the surface\nYes exactly um so when we we we have an investigation program that looks at uh the causes mortality of of mammals are stations sales are exceptional\nAnd I'm In the past we've had what a cold must running events where we turned up on the beach and the uh I'm a significant number of animals I'm all in one group um some of them still in the ... of some of them on the beat some of them alive some that [noise]\nUm on way investigators try and work out why this funding happened in this case it's it's a very different picture\nOf what we've seen is over the course of the last six weeks we've had a an an increasing incidents of I'm a very unusual species that's being washing up I'm light from the sort of the the goal why pay an island all the lights the top of Scotland\nUm so it stays taken us a while to put the pieces together these animals are not alive um they've been dead for for several weeks it say um but it's very unusual to to get any of these animals coming on TALK shows\nHow many in a normal year would you see and how many of you've seen this year [noise]\nSo in a usual yeah um we would get probably between three and four animals in Scotland of this particular species a it's a ... it's a it's quite a cryptic species we now she by ... by these these class substitutions\nI'm On this year so far um we've had sixty eight of these animals that have been washed up I'm On the shores of islands Northern Ireland in Scotland I'm forty five alone in ... which\nIs [noise] they live very deep and the water don't they so what do you think what what is it what is it possible speculate might be happening [noise]\nWell this is what makes this quite tricky because they um they as you say that the species that live well off the shelf hatch so they they inhabit deep ocean trenches they can they held the record for both the deepest and the longest dive of any any animal\nUm they've been clocked to just a under three Columbus is down and they can spend up to two hours down there\nThe reason they go into the the the such extreme environments just because that's where they can find that food which is a squid\nAnd um these these ... to a large number of them off the off the shelf hedge so this is the normal habitat for the species\nUm now that there's the problem is is that when these animals wash your shoulders vi limited amounts of pathology that we can divide from from them because of in such a extensive states the decomposition\nHowever we are I'm aware that this particular species\nIs particularly sensitive to I'm underwater noise um human ... noise in an in specific the effects of midway and ... and that's something that we would want to try and establish whether or not with any particular activities going on off the shelf hedge\nI'm In the last a couple of months that put a lot of this this this noise in the million and bottom\nAny ideas because you know humans haven't been quiet and let's see for quite a long time that something like this should be happening now seems remarkable\nUm indeed it does I mean we we've we've made the oceans vide noisy place in a not so the sense of the general problem in this specific case\nProblem we have is is that this out of the people that up lights the mid right inside an all off in the military\nAnd loving information from than can be quite challenging um the reason that the military ... a an a sudden this frequencies is that it's used for um communication on the association for locating underwater objects such submarines\nOf a sudden all this frequencies is that it's used for um communication on his social used for locating indulge objects such submarines\nSo I'm obviously this is this is sensitive national security level so trying to get the information as to whether it'd be

in jail for corruption and all the other corruption scandals around the\nFederal company and the buying of votes how excited are Brazilians about voting for any politician\nI'm not sure that that excited that there's a lot of trepidation about this one and many people will be choosing the lesser evil or the the least bad candidate that they can find Brazil was sort of on auto pilot from the period Nineteen Ninety four to two thousand and ten you had a series of elections where\nWhen there was a second round of the presidential election it was a choice between a center right candidate an
