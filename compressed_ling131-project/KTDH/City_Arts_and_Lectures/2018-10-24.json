I hate school period like grammar school I'd love to our school I was tested in grammar school\nI was so I was such an outstanding grammar school student you would not believe that these uh when I was in grammar school the main thing we had to do as far as I can recall is drawn pilgrims\n[noise]\nAnd the ... and we love the ... by the way the owners were good show and and the Indians love them too because the worm showed them how to Thanksgiving um so\nI Would love to drawing I was very good joined pilgrims and I even did it at home in my spare time and the fire matches that someday someone would say there there'd be like a pope emergency and people will say can anyone here don't tell them I say I can I can [noise]\nBut once I got to high school\nIn my life completely fell apart because we had algebra and I'm not I mean I count on my fingers I only have a brain\nBut algebra I I don't even know what it is and I was so terrible at it that I took algebra one four times\nAnd I ... and took in summer school and I still don't have any idea what it is and it torture thing it ruined my entire life because I was constantly punished for deli algebra and\nIn my adult life it never came up once\n[noise] and I and I\nThought what would be preparing me for [noise] I mean now you're probably gonna do it on your phone or something but\nBut but you you were actually expelled from high school so I got I was\nI was not exposed to that I I was failing everything I went to public school\nI was failing everything in school things to spend it all the time I was when football games in my high school um I guess every high school um there was one of the worst parts of high school was the football games um but the really worse thing was on friday afternoon\nAfter school was supposed to be out we had pep rallies um for the football game for the next day and I twice got caught sneaking out of the pep rallies and have was mandatory\n[noise] and I had no ... um [noise] and I still have no path um and I hated\nFootball which I also could never understand and that you know I'd be sitting there in ...\nUh [noise] and I still have no ... um and I hated football\nWhich I also could never understand and that you know I'd be sitting there and like everyone ... I wouldn't have no idea what was going on I was over and over again asked people to explain\nThe game to me I could not understand it and finally I realized that you know it was just a simple was kind of an algebra in motion you know something I never going to understand and I didn't never understand why people thought football players were stupid\nBecause that's how she because they'd be they understand football which is quite a bit complicated and then\nMy mother was always been called the school and you know and they don't look she has to go to private school\nMore [noise] there's a lot of people say the Shabaab hands um you know it would be worse depends on the upside of Penn is that he could never ever ever be elected you know I mean because unlike Trump Pence has a very clear ideology\nUm dishes shared luckily by not enough people even in the ...\nUnlike Trump Pence has a very clear ideology um the shared luckily by not enough people even in the really bad states you know I mean even in you know the south\nI'm\nA show that he is a really um he's really a religious not so\nSure that um he 'cause you never be elected so it would be better had then I think um than Trump because she could never be reelected um and so that I'm not afraid\nOf ... being the president um and so that is my opinion about pets I mean of course I like most people I'm never heard of him before I'm a I have actually a friend who lives in Indiana and I should do this ... ... what do you think that she said we're just happy that he's left the state\n[noise]\nDamn Indiana is in case you don't know one of the worst states we have [noise]\nAnd we have plenty of fat [laughter] and ...\nIndiana is where the Ku Klux Klan started you know you say no Alabama know Alabama is better than Indiana in this particular thing\nUm [noise] so I ... Indiana is kind of I Know it's not really in the south but it's kind of in the south um [noise] you know Trump sound depends on the same way he found I'm Kevin ... they ...\nThey know truthfully if we ever took power in a real way the first thing we have to get or these lists [noise] you know when I start like putting these people in jail I Want to list they do they have a list and list of these people\n[noise] especially river on your last\nYes it's leave all what I was sitting next to the person years ago when um they asked question who's your favorite hot you're too young those in power now I'm not and it was really when you do we had a conversation after the fact about it and to this day it's a scare me\nThank you so much as well you know perhaps we'll have another hostage crisis and\nIt'll come up again [laughter] [noise] it's questions from the balcony\nSwitching gears I'm more serious side I just wanted to ask where did you get those boots [noise] I Am so glad you asked I Hope you heard where did you get those books I design these boots [noise] these are unless someone is\nCopy may not impossible the only wing chip cowboy boots in the world um I just I was the person who made these boos which show impossible such so crazy that once I finally got these boots which took him two years to make\nI mean you think it was an essay taking that law took him two years to me I thought take care of each was friend\nYou're never going through this again and so people are very often say oh you know who made your booze would you recommend them I say I would not recommend him over\nThis guy who lived in Texas um for two years kept calling me in line to me on this guy was a very good looking guy in a very sleazy way and he was coming off this lifetime of lying to women show he would\nConstantly call me goes I'm really shy him and the Toronto airport and I was going to have to go to Dallas on it and I said I'm ... I forgot his name I Would say let me explain something to you I Am not your girlfriend [noise] I don't care where you are I Can't wear my boots are [noise]\nSome thank you for another thing that both [noise]\nCensor the orchestra\nGive her another thing that both [noise]\n\nCensor the orchestra Hi Francis nice to meet you I ... I Would invite you to be in my perfect world for a minute where it's past twenty twenty and the Democrats of taking back the house\nThey repealed everything that's gone wrong in the last year and a half and we're looking towards our new president Dennis you in the house [laughter] what would you do in the first one hundred day\nI wouldn't need on ... [noise] what do they say why take a hundred days [noise] I mean it's not like you have to write something something really hard to do\nYou mean everything's already repealed everything is perfect is that what you're saying everything's already perfect that I Would say I'm finished [laughter]\nAnd get on that swelled plane was surely he does not\nDeserve um [noise] you know there are as you know I mean there\nThere's not five minutes go by that you don't think someone has to fix that like it is inconceivable although it just happened that the president of the United states addresses the UN and there's less that [noise]\nI mean\nIt's that's pretty astonishing especially to me who as a child I had to childhood\nIdols one was Leonard Bernstein and moments that commercial um you probably heard Lenovo design you may not have heard that before he was the director general of the UN um I have as many books by that average will have a photograph refrigerator\nUm and so I always think what would that Congress will think of this\nUm when I was a child or when they took our class\nYou know from school for a tour of the un I Know when I was like maybe nine years old and I was incredibly excited because I thought I Would see that commercial um and I had a book or by about ... and I brought it with me and we're walking around the UN or they can figure out who's going to see him and so a man in his shoe walk by\nAnd I thought it was that commercial so I left the line we were always marsh around like my height and then a lot and I listen line and went after him and then I couldn't find them because there were many men in suits and I couldn't tell which one he was and so I pushed a door to where I thought he'd gone through and every alarm and the UN went off\n[noise]\nAnd I gave up a policeman came over and I burst into tears and I said there wasn't that much security there then obviously if I was even able to do this and I kept saying I saw I saw the commercials I thought it was done how much will that I didn't really know who their coverage for was um [noise]\nSo that for me the un I once spoke at the un not to the general assembly\nUm and I was incredibly excited to be at the un I'm Donald Trump um ... you may have missed dish but before he was president his only comment about the UN was he didn't like the ... and that he could get them a better deal [noise]\nOn the marble trial um so I Will I truthfully thing that if Abraham Lincoln came back to life it would take a decade to repair the damage that Trump is done I really do do you know uh\nI Can't really tell you what I could accomplish in a hundred days um but except for Abraham Lincoln more than most\n[noise]\nYou're listening to a conversation with friendly but with this is ... from next to this is from New York it's alright er here I mean I\nI um to me you're sort of an autonomous with New York in the seventies\nAnd eighties and that's where I happen to be\nOh here in a high um\nTo me you're sort of an autonomous with New York in the seventies and eighties and that's where I happen to be from and I just I'm curious about what are your thoughts on sentimentality or is there anything that makes you sentimental and if so what ... what are your thoughts in general about in the style Joe\n... is a very poisonous thing is a really bad thing ... that's why you have Donald Trump as a president you know this that it that is that the ... the sound is is is truthfully about something that never existed\nYou know or is she said you know is when we do have Giuliani ran for mayor the first time we don't see very many um political ads in New York especially for presidential elections because it's the most expensive media markets and because you know they're not going to trick New York into voting for Republican for president\n[noise] um [noise]\nBut we see local a political as and when Giuliani first ran for mayor I have seen people you know the the ads are almost exactly Trump as you know later years and\nI should watch these ads for Giuliani basically he's saying vote for me and this will be Nineteen fifty eight again and when you're was great you know and it ... exact same thing that Trump does and that Trump did and you know it was who was your great for\nYou guys that she was great for show was not wait for anyone else Newark in the seventies um too much to my astonishment I'm I Am constantly step in the street by people in their twenties telling me they wish they lived in Europe in the seventies\nNow this is really not a good thing because I Know that when I was in my twenties I wasn't constantly thinking I Wish I Lived in Europe from the thirties\nYou know [noise] it is the\nJob of people who are young to do new things that is their job\nOkay so you know [noise] person on the ... that\nPeople have for their own lives you know that's fine that's harmless you know that's just human nature um but it's very bad for the culture for sure not just the society it is terrible for the culture\nThat is why we have seen for the last like thirty five years this kind of round Robin of collages you know that you see in every single art form you know I I went to a at a party for someone in their twenties is at a friend's kid um and I knew every single song they're playing now that's not right [noise]\nYou know put your African on your lap don't put your hat don't reach over someone do grammar less has all this stuff nonstop this is my childhood summed up I Would say to my mother can I please have an apple and my mother would say may I please have an apple and I would say that we should have an apple and she would say no\n[noise] show consequently I had excellent enters\nThe most I can hope for in that regard is I have lately been trying to bring back the phrase you You're welcome because here's what happens now ... says thank you for coming than the other person says thank you for having me Oh thank you for comes\nAnd goes on forever [noise]\nHow I've lately been saying that people will say thank you for coming I'll say You're welcome and they look at me like you are so rude\n[noise] so if you mean civility like in\nThe Senate is apparently there was there was this time where these senators walked off arm in arm you know in some wonderful or a friendship I'm certainly much better than it is now\nI'm there that would certainly be better um you know there's constant talk about how partisan politics have become I mean is it in a way kind of funny I mean\nPolitics partisan politics is redundant you know politician apart is and that's the point of politics at their partisan um the problem with politics is not that they're part is the problem with politics of Republicans [noise]\n\n\nQuestions from the center of the balcony high high um\nWould you please tell us a little bit about your participation in law and order\n[laughter] um [laughter] I have it or that's what I please tell you or at least her um about my participation law and order which was a TV show um where I played um either I'm a recurring part as an arraignment judge\n'em I got this part by begging them to give me that\nI knew I pay them more because they don't play the police captain him and\nUh that that that I met ... who invented this thing and I should put me on that I I Love letter I still love law and order I Love it there is not the only thing I Know that other people find other ways we're last yoga spies you know [noise]\nI'm not the spot or you might imagine but whatever that usually gives ... others like three I hear that I've become the Dalai Lama [noise]\nBecause it's only a relaxed and one of my biggest objection to present the\nCome the Dalai Lama [noise]\nBecome instantly relaxed and one of my biggest objection to the president the\nPopular culture is why there is not a law and order channel [noise] because that's the only thing I ever want to see on television\nIs water and so they actually first um or we're going to give me this part as a real judge 'em and I had to go and audition for him and the producers sit there and I I did the audition and I knew I was horrible and the second I stopped\nI should look I Know it was really bad I said you know if this person too big for me I'm don't give me this part give me an arraignment judge part because that's really reached by two sentences and the British had a friend\nActors don't say I Know I failed the audition so give me a different part I said I Know but I'm not an actor\nSo I can say it so they did give me this part and it was fantastic because first of all you got to where the judicial robe which the law and order was done on film\nShow it was just like shooting a movie show you know the work days even if you were on for two minutes or like you know twelve sixteen hours you'd be there forever I'm the second I Would arrive I Would go to the wardrobe department put on my ... they would say friends you don't have the robot now oh that joking\nAbout [noise] and I remember\nThey shot it and in Chelsea Studios which are on the river where they were judged started then to build now it's finished unfortunately this past you know for people to like ride bicycles and skateboard and like it's like the whole city turn into some summer camp [noise] and I was outside smoking\nCigarettes where am I robe and this kid came ... down on a skateboard this kid was like a million tattoos and\nPiercings and they saw me and you stop like that and he said I didn't know there was a court here and I said there's a court everywhere\n[noise]\nSo I I really love I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed\nThe law and order I I also\nReal ... uh every other judge on TV copied me\nBecause when you sit at that bench which is the best she'd ever in any room in the world you know you sit there you're hired then everyone else you have a real comfortable chair and you have a gamble and because the gavel is there I took to like ...\nAnd I instantly got dozens of letters from lawyers and judges many from judges you are not supposed to gamble\nYou're not gamble is for by the way to judge you are not supposed to go home and less there is an outburst or something in the courtroom\nUm however now every single television judge ... [noise] it's just in tears is simple thing you can't not gamble is [noise] I Can't tell you what a pleasurable thing which is think about it you have a hammer in your hand that stopped other people from talking [noise]\n\nThis is from the back of the center of the orchestra actually as you have ... I I remember seeing and you ah sorry excuse me I remember seeing you on the documentary Paris's burning and I wanted to know what you thought about roof Paul and the drug scene becoming more popular I apparently\nParis's burning which I think it was made like twenty five year I mean it was really a long time ago\nUm I'd forgotten about it is apparently been revived it because lots of people who are young talk about this movie um [noise] uh I I Know we're Paul I mean I've actually met ripple is is a TV show right\nThe drags it wherever you are that it's like a contest for drug wings which is now on television I mean this is the kind\nIs it is a TV show right\nThe drag say whatever you know it's like a contest for ... which is now on television I mean this is the kind of thing that used to be like a very covert thing because it was against the law\nSo it was very covered it was extremely different and now it's on television and this is apparently the most progress we can hope for but in the seventies for instance\nAh sometimes I Would be at a party or someplace and someone would come in with drag and I would always say how'd you get here 'cause you could not walk on the street like that you'd be arrested you could not\nBe on the subway like that you know only candy could do that because people thought that she was a girl she didn't\nReally look like a girl but never occurred to anyone that a man with a life that you know should there was an upside to this repression by the way I'm which is that you know she couldn't walk around like that um I Know that now it's like a it's so interesting that we live in a country I think this is a very popular TV show\nUm which means that many many people in the country like this and think it's fine and it's okay and they still vote for Donald Trump\nShow you know these things are not always how they look you know there's just not always a sign of you know being pro Russian I'm at the ... ... is burning was about um [noise] I Can't see what it's called them these contests\nVoting that's right so those vogue and things I used to go to them on they were ... they were a fantastically\nInteresting because they're completely invented you know that ah and I remember that when I did interview for Paris is burning 'em a lot of people that we are talking about that then you know a magic to me what was interesting about it was that\nIt was a mistake and at that time for some kind of humanism which in fact it's the opposite is desire to be conventional that causes that not the desire to be rebellious you know you don't have to be rebellious if everyone already hate you\nShow that I think there's just things that people don't really understand about this so it's interesting to me that it ended up as a popular network television show 'em and I was very popular I don't think that real voting exist anymore there's no way that it could be 'cause you could afford to rent those places\nHigh friend I'd I'd love to know your take on the me too movement\nOkay she's left on my take on the me too movement because you think that might have some contrary opinion like that idea or um [noise]\nFish is one of these things that I have found completely surprising you know I never imagined this would happen not necessarily an years because being a woman was the shame from like IV [noise] until like six months ago [noise]\n\nShow naturally\nIt never occurred to me this one ever change you know and so it ... it really changed I mean the first\nYou know I don't know the first dozen guys who got caught I Know every single one of them personally every single one of them and if you told me one minute before that these guys would be gone\nI Would never believed in a million years not\nA million years now I have to say I mean to like Harvard for instance I think it was the\nFirst one I knew her rate for a million years I Know a million stories about Harvey I Believe every single one of them but I never heard\nThese rape stories I never heard this violence George I never heard them be and that is because you know it's one thing like ... for someone to get a part in the movie which by the way that the definition for that would always have been the movie business um [noise]\nThe but the the ... the violence and read I never heard that I heard a million stories about Charlie Rose I never heard the stories about these interns\nThe but the the ... the violence and read I never heard that I heard a million stories about Charlie Rose I never heard the stories about these interns you know I never heard the stories chairs and how I feel I Believe every single woman proved to me she's lying [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "24"}
