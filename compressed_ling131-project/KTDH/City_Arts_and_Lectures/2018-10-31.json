Lived in Lincoln, Nebraska a\nLincoln\nWhere I'm currently in the middle of a passive aggressive\nYard sign more with my neighbors\nAs we head into the mid term election [noise] um [noise] when I was house hunting in the fall of twenty sixteen there weren't any signs in any yards to indicate the political leanings of my potential neighbors I didn't know what this men and so I asked my realtor a lifelong nebraskan who told me it wasn't Nebraska nice\nMeaning it was considered sort of rude to have a political sign out in your yard I grew up in Florida in Miami a in a neighborhood where the bar for were counted as rude was quite a bit higher\n[noise] my\nFamily help nudge that bar hire a when they moved in\nThey were the first Cubans to buy into a predominantly white neighborhood prompting the white flight that's made our neighborhood overwhelmingly Latino today [noise] ah my parents still live in that house\nWhen my dad paid it off he celebrated by burning various house related documents over a charcoal grill in the backyard us kind of rude actually um he made us all come outside to watch and within a year he would decide to borrow against the house\nTo help me pay for college they claim they were happy to help me and I believe them they drew me a surprise party when I graduated from college I was the first in my family to do so and it was in many ways a party for all of us\nThey rented a banquet hall invited everyone they felt had played a key part in my arriving at that moment\nAnd told me we were going to have cousins baby shower shortly after everyone yelled surprise my dad's at the microphone and started the festivities by introducing one of the few white American families there he pointed to them and said do you recognize these people\nI did not [noise]\nSaid those are the people who sold us our house [noise] because we lived in that house you went to the schools you went to had the teachers you add everything we would not be standing here today and they never told us that house [noise] my ... the family waves from there\nHad the teachers you add everything we would not be standing here today and they never told us that house [noise] my ... the family waved from their table [noise]\n\nI don't think they know why they were there on this I think they thought it was a baby shower to um [noise] just sentiment that house is so much more than a house that house means destiny\nOpportunity has played out in various ways throughout my life\nWhile married I saved for a house house becoming\nSynonymous with future and with family the first time I've ever owned in Tallahassee, Florida came with a cautionary tale I bought it from a lawyer who had been given the house as a wedding present from his parents who just happens to live in the house next door\nFor reasons that were never made clear but about which the town's real estate agents loved to speculate the house had been on the market for more than a year the rumor being that the sellers father had put out a warning that no one should buy it [noise] I moved there from Los Angeles and his warning had it made it that far\nEveryone who came to work on the house had a story one contractor told me that when the previous owners had put up the for sale find the sellers mother came over with a marker and defaced it scrolling at the cost of our love across\nIt [noise]\nThe sellers father would often knock on my door and ask after the baby forgetting over and over again that I did not have children he would glance passed me into the living room\nWith the look on his face and said why do you need all this space when the marriage ended and the house was sold with it when everything the house was supposed to become I moved to Nebraska single singing the praises of renting forever that is until ... intervened\nA financial planner she'd been recommended to me by an accountant who sense for my shoe box full of receipts and my habit bringing every official looking paper mail to me to wear meetings that I needed some financial guidance\nLotto was in her mid fifties and about a foot taller than me she had a wide smile a personalized coasters on her desk\nShe was originally from Mitchell South Dakota and I'd been some missiles famed corn palace once so we hit it off instantly [noise] first things first one to set after reviewing the financials of my life you need to buy some property in Lincoln that probably means a house\nI did want anyone under forty does in a moment like that I treated someone tell me if I should buy a house question mark [noise] among the responses was a direct message from my former husband who hadn't been in contact in months no you should not buy a house\nCondo though maybe just my two euro not two cents he wrote euro [noise]\n\nFor the first time in my life I had a stable income no debt and no financial dependence and I just sold a house I knew I was very lucky and I was supposed to do something responsible with this privilege I asked ... if I could\nBuy a condo or lost or maybe a warehouse I joked I wanted to be able to roller skate inside of whatever property I own a lot of real\nOf this down [noise] she looked up from her no pat and said I said Lincoln's got another Fifteen Twenty years before a funky enough city to support warehouse living [noise] I showed her the message from my ex husband and told her that I'd crowd source of the question\nShe said everything I'm putting together about you it sounds like your number one priority with a property is what I'd call ease of exits meaning getting out of something quickly if I needed to in Lincoln\nLike your number one priority with a property is what I'd call ease of exit meaning getting out of something quickly if I needed to in Lincoln she said that's a single family home but that's not for me I argued homes or for families homes determine everything from where your kid might go to college to how long your marriage will last\nI was sitting at her office in pajama pants and in a shirt that said team Gigi and had all sketch it catches them off or Golden Girls\nProcess [noise]\nIt took almost a year for law has helped me rewrite the narrative that had been keeping me from buying a home and the one I Would eventually by I stood next to my realtor and its bathroom and freaked out about the size of an at the site of an oversized customs help from Nineteen thirty nine which was built in seats\nWhen when she was state Senate minority leader she gave this really wrenching speech I'm begging her colleagues to reject a really ... bill that would force women to by special\nInsurance riders if they wanted coverage for abortion even in cases of rape and incest which are obviously life events that people you know don't plan for and by special writers for [noise]\nSo when she was speaking to our colleagues she said if I had her prepared remarks and talked about how she'd been raped in college and she told me she told them it's something I\nWhen she was speaking to our colleagues she said if I had her prepared remarks and talked about how she'd been raped in college and she told me she told them it's something I've hidden for a long time but I think you need to see the face of the women that you were impacted by this vote today\nIt was really painful moment that seemed to accomplish nothing um her colleagues still voted for the bill\nAnd then she pre figured Christine Blasey Ford who blew up her life to testify that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school only to see him confirmed anyway\nAnd she I'm Gretchen with murder described to me how depressing and demoralizing it was to watch glad they go through this come forward subject yourself to the world's hospitals scrutiny\nAnd then have it seemed to make no difference\nBut it did make a difference um the demoralization didn't last and on the Sunday after Kavanaugh is confirmed Widmer held a packed rally with New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's it's still just like I was back at the women's march she said the previous day had been really really terrible for a lot of women [noise]\nBut they were showing up and seeing one on one another and saying we've got work to do\nI showed ... my friend's taxed and asked her if we are going to be OK\nIf she was really sure that Democrats were going to to win this time I Am she fed I see it every day I talked to people every day and so we talked a lot of politicians and part of their job is to project optimism\nNevertheless if you kind of are in a dark place like I Am often in a dark place\nUm all the way to find some of that optimism is to talk to the women who are out there working their hearts out to stop him you know if you're scared if you were furious if you're a despondent\nFind a Democrat and go canvas go knock on doors I mean canvassing is is ... I'm ... it's the best way to feel good about the world and connect with people as she as we were told me [noise]\nSo I read all the books about fascism I'm like [laughter] if you look at my coffee table you can see why I no fun at parties um but [noise]\nOne of the recent ones how fascism works\nBy the professor Jason Stanley was I think particularly important because it's one of the few that focused on the role of um gender and patriarchy and in in the fascist resurgence and he talked about patriarchy is quote strategically central the fascist politics\nHow because they always seek to cement racial and gender hierarchies um and as he put it when women attained positions of political power usually reserved for men or when Muslims blacks Jews homosexuals are cosmopolitan profit or even share the public good of a democracy such as health care\nThat is perceived as corruption he wrote\nSo that's sentencing calculates how Trump who's the most corrupt president in American history can sell themselves as corruptions opponent but it also shows why so many women sense an existential threat from Trump that goes beyond his personal abortion is\nI think women all over the country understand intuitively that his threat to liberal democracy and his threat to the gender equality are intertwined\nSoon really soon a majority of women could rise up repudiated repudiate him at long last create a check on his power women though of course not only women could save this country and themselves\nLong last create a check on his power women do of course not only women could save this country and themselves longing for this to happen and not being as short as well as almost physically painful the only way to feel better to do something to help you [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you're just an amazing crowd\nAnd she's like yeah [noise] so it's our great pleasure to 'em and privilege to Iraq than a year when I [noise]\nThe negativity\nOpinion writer for a number of years so I'm pretty recently we decided the world could use trade vice so we've um launched the abstract fan and vice calm and she's going to do a little bit of it live for you it's nice [noise]\nYes I Am [noise]\nI Love San Francisco it's a pleasure to be here tonight and it's gorgeous base was um this is my second time at the ... you know it's interesting I wanted to do in the ... I've always wanted to do an advice column I Love dear Abby and Ann Landers growing up and I read all of the sort of present\nDay I'm advice column about Paul ... and Dan\nSavage and um I even once in awhile listen to Dr Laura who is the do [noise] there's a reason why I\nListen to Dr Laura and it has to do with love 'em [noise] 'cause I don't care about Dr Laura I think she's the one part of it but I actually got a question that I answered in this week's column and\nIt's about love and so I thought I Would read my answer well I'm also going to read the questions that you know what why am I was [noise] it goes well\nDirects than I Am forty three year old single never been married educated mother of one and would like advice on love I'm navigating dating life need to fully understand the difference between loving someone being in love and having a\nSoul mate I Love the idea of love and would very much like to spend the rest of my life with a man\nBut I find myself having commitment issues because I'm afraid of choosing wrong I see\nCouples that have been married ten Fifteen Twenty years who get divorced him seemed to be completely fine with it it's scary to me because I Would like my marriage to last a lifetime and my over thinking this totally or being too paranoid or do you really never know because only time will tell sincerely where the hell\nIs the love of my life [noise] deer searching for the love of her life\nWe live in a culture that idealize as the idea of love and the idea that there is one true person who will complete you fulfill all your dreams and love you forever\nWe're told from an early age that are true love is out there waiting for us and so we earned defined them to know what it feels like to experience true love to know you have made the right choice\nThe truth about love is that it is often but we'll during a knowable you may never know if you have made the right choice but when love is true you embrace all of the unknowns regardless I Am forty four in a complicated romantic situation\nNever know if you have made the right choice but when love is true you embrace all of the unknowns regardless\nI Am forty four and a complicated romantic situation never been married I Am no expert on love I Love the idea of love but I have lived in love long enough to recognize that there is a difference between the idea of laws and the reality of love\nYou never really know if a marriage relationship will last\nA lifetime you can want that you can work hard to make a relationship work and have the best of intentions and still things might not work out\nBut that doesn't mean you have wasted your time or failed many people who choose divorce are completely fine with it because they know the difference between the idea and reality of love they know there was nothing to be gained from staying in a marriage simply because the idea of love\nDemands pretending everything is fine when such as not the case what may seem cavalier to you is most likely a decision that has been agonized\nOver a few people take divorce lightly because it is a profoundly painful thing to end the commitment you nurtured and fought for and hoped would last a lifetime\nAnd your letter you are very much focused on what could be rather than what is you worry about choosing wrong but are not considering that you might choose right for a lifetime or write for a moment\nWhen you meet someone and start dating you have no idea where things will lead\nYour hopes yes and dreams but you also have to get from one day to the next\nGetting to know a person deciding to deepen the relationship and sometimes choosing the formula is a commitment and it's so very important to know what you want from a relationship but you also have to create space for a relationship to develop without worrying about what that relationship will or will not become\nIf you ask thirty three people about the difference between loving someone being in love and soul mates you will get thirty three different answers\nSo I Will simply tell you what these things are to me I Am all about the chase seduction ... not just during the shimmering early days of a relationship but also years and when you're thinking about the maddening ways your person behaves but still is this a day a good day to send them some front\nIt's too painful to see these lives being taken and so many of these people men and women are so very young and it just breaks my heart and I can stay informed without seeing the graphic evidence\nAnd the other thing I Do for myself is right and try to increase awareness and to hold people to account for racism that\nIs healthy for me but you have to find some kind of outlet for the paying for the grief for the rage otherwise it will consume you I also think it's important to find a community that you feel comfortable in in San Francisco is an odd city I\nAlways think of it as a diversity because I'm from Omaha Nebraska [noise] and so really anything as diverse compared to our [laughter] um but there aren't a lot of black people here and so you might want to go toward Oakland where there is a\nFirebrand flat [noise] um at least for socializing and when you find community you will be able to share your grief with other people who are going to understand exactly what you mean\nAnd that can be really really useful and then also the Internet I find a lot of community online because for until recently I've lived in the middle of nowhere and so when I wanted to talk about these kinds of things I found black friends on the Internet\nAnd it sounds a little silly but it's been invaluable to me to be able to talk about that when you I live in a well not anymore but until the first I Lived in um Lafayette, Indiana which there are not a lot of black people they're either and\nIt's so it was really useful to develop a community on line of black people so that when these things happen and I think oh my God mine going to murder my neighbor um I Know that people can talk me off the ledge and say no don't go to jail for them [laughter]\nGet Internet Friends\nYeah very good enough friend um and I we have one last question here for Iraq than hello rock than what is your best loved comfort food that you would share it with a dear friend and tough times\nI Know emotional eating can make us crazier than we might already be personally speaking but perhaps speaking for more than just yourself but also food as love ensued as medicine for me and many others how do we reconcile or many hunger is how do you do that\n[noise] that's a great question I don't the older I get the more I recognize that I'm allowed to have hunger and that it's okay to satisfy those hunger is a within moderation\nThe older I get the more I recognize that I'm allowed to have hunger and that it's okay to satisfy those hunger is a within moderation my dad loves to talk about moderation walks on everything in moderation okay\nAnd I'm always like [noise] yeah I got it [noise] um [noise]\nBut it's true I think that a lot of the reason that we see so many people having such unhealthy relationships to joy to food to sex\nTo to to vice\nIs because we're told not to have any we deprive ourselves of so much that could make life a little easier and so I'm working on just indulging when I Want and um my nutritionist has been really into this thing called intuitive eating which is exactly what it sounds like\nAnd [laughter] it should be that complicated\nBut it's been really useful like when you are craving something allow yourself to habit deprivation never works out and so that's how I'm working on reconciling my hunger and uh in terms of comfort food\nI really love Italian food and I would love to share a good um set of ravioli with a friend or lasagna anything with carbohydrates cheese tomatoes and more cheese\n[noise] I think more she is yeah especially when it smelled the and it starts pulling and that's just like oh this is sex right now [noise] thank you for that\nIf a welcome um we have a herd of advice from accent now we're going to end the evening with that conversation with everyone um so I Want to invite Janine and Michelle to come back on stage\nIn la [noise] [noise]\nHello I think for coming back out and I wanted to start\nA talking a little bit of women in politics were in a city that knows how to elect women um so I thought it seems like a good moment to do it um ... we talked about them in terms of a lot and um people are talking about the idea of a pain wave or there are a lot of women running and it echoes nation I Need\nTo which was also called the ... the woman so we're going to do a very quick game which is I read a quote and you're going to tell me if it's from Nineteen Ninety two year old woman [laughter] for twenty eight candy whatever this will be called sleep we are either you you are\nYes um I mean I suppose you could get help from the crowd if it feeling I mean let them try but if it feels like it's really not going\nTo house okay [noise] um okay so let's start with Michelle and God healthy it's old than if they kick off these suburban women who've never really thought that their reproductive\nRights are at risk and all of a sudden there is that risk and Israel is that from Nineteen Ninety two or twenty Eighteen [noise] but how the so no I'm going I'm going to guess Nineteen eighty two\nUm that's like more optimistic than the world but I don't think they know is worried by the press in July wow God help those old man I'm okay this is\nDescribing a campaign out of the campaign ads opens with the hands of a pin stripe suited man walking a Barbie doll across the TV screen some\nPoliticians treat women like they're not quite real an announcer and tones outlining the opponents strict opposition to abortion\nI mean the pin striped suit makes me think Nineteen Ninety two\n\nThe opponents strict opposition to abortion I mean the ... district suit makes me think thinking maybe too\n[laughter] [noise]\nNo actually it was hot thing I found um [laughter]\nI mean at the your top ... song not surprisingly it was going to men's end up the road\n[laughter] Nineteen Ninety two yeah I don't know why it sort of like a question that you got it was the voice of men was really really they give away [laughter] for me I was finally one to not\nDemonstrate the I'm a lack of changes that we've talked about women running for office okay I'm a one more free it should be here um [noise]\nCandidates from both sides of the aisle say they've encountered voters who are relieved to see more women on the ballot particularly in light of high profile sexual harassment scandals that have rocked Congress and private industry you know when the guest thinks in eighty two again does anyone want to\nOffer [noise] [laughter]\n[noise] okay [noise] additional saw okay how can I get back okay for Eighteen ...\n[laughter]\n... [laughter] um but your husband in the wizard of the point of the exercises um [noise] one more um for each of you are not just have a different style with one being interviewed said they're more warrior oriented we're a little more consensus builder\nRoxanna but that's twenty Eighteen bucks in very good at this game\n[laughter] I read her views the law [laughter] true\nI'm OK last one forging the and\nThis was that's about voice to my well it's an online I sort of exhausted by ... sorry I'm this is a quote from\nSomeone who was interviewed interviewed about politics it's still a men's club until they get more women involved that they're not going to understand maybe it's a man becomes a woman and then get politically involved they will begin to understand a little\n[noise] that was now isn't it is the twenty eighth team um does anyone\nThey want to do [laughter] I was just found the trend is pretty good team Ninety to ... to ... yeah I think I'm here to give away I didn't keep reading what she continued to say was it would I Would have to see a woman in a big position like vice president\nOh I thought that she was dreaming up so I'm Sorry I'm really ought to get it on in the crowd but\nUm it does indicate that there's a lot that feel the same way we talk about these things and there's a lot there there's small things that have changed like she might have said I'd have to say one president [noise] um I wondered if you couldn't speak to how you feel now I'm compared to how you saw\nIn November nights twenty sixteen and what's going into that feeling in terms of looking ahead or just general mood rock then you were nodding oh um\n[noise]\nI you know like the collective side of the audience then when you ask the question I think that's how we're all feeling I knew it was going to be a\nBad when Trump was elected but I thought naively that since he's just a rank capitalist that he would just be doing money grab\nBut it turns out that he's also willing to implement a lot of truly dangerous ... policies in addition to the money grabs and so I just feel truly", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "31"}
