Bush and I wanted to kind of see what the religious right was doing now obviously liberty is like you know Trump gave the commencement address there last year it's become sort of a big\nRepublican operative machine um\nBut back then it was still run by the senior Jerry Falwell who's since died and it was it was a bizarre and and sort of wild experience of being not only like going to classes there but living in the dorms and singing in the church choir and things like that\nAnd how undercover worry people now that you were writing a book\nNo no I I transferred there as if I was like you know just a student and I I I went to to brown which is sort of like the opposite\nOf um [noise] [noise] if you are the\nFocus on like from from from brown to liberty yeah it ... it was like I'm actually they\nHad a very funny reaction to the liberty because like I was sitting there and where did you come from and I would say I would say you know I I went to brown and they said my God I'm so sorry\n[laughter] it must be awful there how do you how did you do that they assumed I was like an evangelical\nTrapped um [laughter] so we had fun in the liberal you want you to college with pastel grace yes um then you've got around to that ... [noise] I'm only in San Francisco to Ivy League schools are listed applause\n[laughter] yes yes I'm [laughter] I\nDon't feel it's it's hard to start to feel the me going back and looking at your resume that at the idea of immersion immersion of of putting yourself in a sort of ... to you at least an exotic\nWorld and just kind of bearing herself and it is you're calling card and the most recent version of that as as listeners the daily now has been immersing herself profoundly in meeting the darkest corners of the weather I mean as you say you're a beat his kind of prefer perversion of the Internet\nYou know I'm I'm interested in\nExtremes I'm interested in people who choose to live\nVery differently than I Do and um and part of what we've seen happen over the past several years is that\nThe Internet and social media has has really given voice to extremist and I'm I'm very interested in how that happens and what kinds of things they choose to do and where they congregate so I'm I have you know every day I wake up and I turned on my computer and I\nI have like a whole running list of like awful for Chan a sub boards and read it threads that I check and then I check my email after that [laughter]\nIn extremes I'm interested in people who choose to live\nVery differently than I Do and um and part of what we've seen happen over the past several years is that\nThe Internet and social media has has really given voice to extremist and I'm I'm very interested in how that happens and what kinds of things they choose to do and where they congregate so I'm I have you know every day I wake up and I turned on my computer and I I have like a whole running list of like\nAwful fortune a sub boards and\nRead it threads that eye tracking that I you know check my email\n[laughter] after you take a job that\nI Wish people why we put together this particular cast of characters on stage and it's because we're very much wanted to explain the essential elements of what it is to make the daily and so here on stage tonight you have the like three a tab atomic elements of the show you have your dashing host they\n[noise] um you have [noise]\n\nUm [noise]\nYou have your your your intrepid undercover reporter and you have your brilliance behind the scenes producer any brown [noise]\nUm [noise] and and and forget that we're going to draw back the curtain on on of course the tech industry but also how ... how we make the daily and the reality is that when you drop back the curtain on the daily\nIt's not always so perfect and highly produced or even pretty and I say that because you may remember this if you listen to the first couple of weeks of the show I don't come from the world of audio\nI don't I have no experience in the world of audio I mean in reality I Do not deserve to be an audio host I did not come from this world I Am not one of you and um\nAnd when the show started I encountered a tremendous amount of difficulty actually just doing the work of of being an audio host my voice was much higher than it is now we can talk about how that changed\nAnd I read audio rip your best and yeah that's what I call it um and and I\nBecause the message or just yet they're they're they're carrying tiki torches in the in Charlottesville rally and when I found it I was like I had been so desensitized by watching it for so long that it was like I Would I like so happy to have found the tiki torches and then putting it together it's it's unsettling but the\nUm we we do have this clip\n\nThere are a lot of people arranging car pools and talking about you know where to find lodging and [noise]\nAnd I\nWent to where it was a big thing of some of the younger white nationalist or sort of rolling their eyes at some of the groups like the KKK and the sort of more millennial\nNeo Nazis was like oh God those guys are so embarrassing like in their these boomers with their hoods and their robes and they're just like so cringe worthy of us\nSo they were sort of advocating\nFor the more so I I'm ... what role does does this accord play in the actual\nUnite the Right rally and ultimately I guess the violence that occurred I mean how directly do you feel like a site like this conversation is like those that you're listening to and we just heard and a contributing to what happens there wasn't\nSpace where people are able to gather\n... and their robes and they're just like so cringe were that'd be awesome [noise]\n[noise]\nSo they were sort of advocating for them more and so I I'm trying to remember what role does does this accord\nPlay in the actual unite the Right rally and ultimately I guess the violence that occurred I mean how directly do you feel like a site like this conversation is like those that you're listening to and we just heard and a contributing to what happens there wasn't\nAny space where people are able to gather\nIn sort of semi private or private\nArea is it going to be prone to this I mean this is not I don't think this is this court's fault 'em but I think after the after in our story ran after the the pod cast came out they did to crack down on these guys and and ban a lot of the biggest for clusters of extremists from their server since then you know some more popped up\nBut they're keeping a closer eye on it now and you ended up interviewing\nPeople in this group in this disorder but\nYeah I I called up a couple of the members and and one in particular was sort of one of the leaders of this group is one of the organizers of the rally in is a big some Internet I'm All right presents and um yeah we had a very interesting conversation\nI Want to play this clip of you're talking to this white nationalist because I think it does something really important in explaining why we created the daily and why the show is what it is which is it creates a real transparency around reporting and storytelling and one of the things we don't\nTalk about on the show is kind of\nHow much the show is guided by what happened in the presidential election and the feeling that a lot of us had enough you know I definitely had that journalism and kind of failed us in twenty sixteen and then we had arrived at a point where\nReaders justify only like didn't understand how we were getting our information and so little misled about the conclusions that that that they had drawn because of the reporting we did\nAnd and the daily is all about letting listeners really understand how journalism happens what it's like to be on the phone with somebody what it's like when Dianne Feinstein answers the phone or in this case a white nationalist interrogate you and and I want to play that they can they think it helps people understand what journals and actually sounds like\n\nYou want to ask you a question you sort of stopped and said well can I ask you a question for the personal\n[noise] what race are you [noise] ah\nThe you've seen my profile yeah she looked Hispanic to me as a ... or you're white or Jewish is a question [noise]\nWell if you're white than a than a few years there'll be a part of this group that if you read it [noise] okay All right [laughter] have a good day\nAnd he's ... he's basically trying to beat you into saying something ... and this is\nLike the kind of story that would never that that would never make it into a print version probably but that we would I Would tell so you know my colleagues at the bar or that we would come up in conversation I I Love that about it's sort of what the reporter's notebook element of the daily that's what's so fun as we get to\nWrite a story for the paper and then bring all of the kind of extra material in\nAnd make it you know come alive in audio\nAnd we only have this clip because\nHe was actually recordings you so I think it's important to understand that it wasn't like you were recording this conversation necessarily fear it I think you were doing some kind of fact checking with him in this conversation he records that and then she uploads it onto you ... as a kind of like gotcha moment\nI Love that about it's sort of ... the reporter's notebook element of the day and that's what's so fun as we get to write a story for the paper and then bring all of the kind of extra material in and make it you know come alive in audio\nAnd we only have this clip because\nHe was actually recording you so I think it's\nImportant to understand that it wasn't like you were recording this conversation necessarily fear it I think you were doing some kind of fact checking with him in this conversation he records\nThat and then he applauds that onto you ... as a kind of like gotcha moment and this is sort of crazy to me that like you are in in your regular reporting life are find yourself in these kinds of there'll be traps\nWhere your sources are trying to catch ill or or like corner you said that you say something that could potentially be banning for your career\nYeah and I always have to be on the lookout for that I mean are there are a lot of people with strong feelings about the New York times positively or negatively and we've we've learned that you know there are people who will try to plant false stories who will try to trick us we'll try to catch us doing something um so it's just it just makes you more cautious as a reporter I think\nI Wonder how much time you spend thinking about\nThe dangers of amplifying this kind of journalism I mean you send your day in this world and then you write about it and then you come on a daily and we're all collectively putting a lot of energy and time in front and audio into essentially giving these people may be a bigger platform and I wonder how you grapple with that\nYeah it's something that I think about a lot and I obviously you know we don't want to be a megaphone for people with extreme or sort of dangerous views on the other hand I'm\nAs with this court like a lot of times are reporting on this is the thing that brings the existence of these communities into people's awareness\nAnd in some cases actually leave the platforms themselves to kind of crack down on them so even though we may be amplifying like one specific set of people it can lead to a major\nOverhaul and changes at these platforms which can then sort of like it'd be a net good\nMore the quality of the conversation but I also think like that's kind of I when I get to watch a lot like how can you amplify things like Q A non or um things that might remain on the fringes and I guess my answer is that these people have platforms I mean there there are people like Alex Jones and others have enormous\nInternet platforms they they sort of um you know sometimes they're bigger than ours and so I think in that case we can sort of services like a translator or a corrective interest explaining to people sort of what's happening who's involved and what um what's the nature of the conversation is that\nHow how much did a sites like Facebook Twitter you to how much of a rule that they play and taking what you are experiencing underscored and letting it run at all free on their websites well this is sort of like how\nAnd hate speech and sort of extremist content moves through the Internet there's like sort of a well established\nPath for it goes from like you know this corridor for channel that goes to read it and that goes to Twitter and then it goes to Facebook and YouTube um so that's pretty familiar I think that ... ... right now what some of these companies are grappling with this kind of like how do we interrupt that chain or like how do we make it so that the stuff doesn't\nI'm getting millions of eyeballs on it but it's hard right like these people are crafting if you shut them down one place they moved to another place I'm with a different name so a lot of the servers that that got deleted from discord after Charlottesville are not back up with with other names um and if your platform it's kind of like a wax\nPath for it goes from like you know this corridor fortune goes to read it and that goes to Twitter and then it goes to Facebook and you too um so that's pretty familiar I think that ... right now what some of these companies are grappling with this kind of like how do we interrupt that chain or like how do we make it so that the stuff doesn't\nI'm getting millions of eyeballs on it\nBut it's hard right like these people are crafting a few shut them down one place they move to another place I'm with a different name so a lot of these servers that that got deleted from discord after Charlottesville are now back up with with other names um and if your platform it's kind of like a whack a mole game it's it's pretty much so it's hard to win\nWhere are these guys now [noise] um they some of them are are still on to score they've also moved into\nUm groups on what's up they've moved into um they moved down to read it they're they're sort of spread out a little more than they used to be outside of centralized where you have five thousand people in one group but they have sort of smaller pockets\nOf that and one of the things you've done so well and the daily is explain\nHow much accountability or non accountability has occurred when it comes to the big social media companies that have been number comes from both burdened by this and in some people's minds complicit in its amplification so\nYou have kind of made a sub beat it and your job of explaining to the world what Facebook\nEspecially has been doing when it comes to this and my favorite episodes in the daily and I never expected them to be even listen I'm all for the congressional hearings and Baltimore soccer\nYeah those are fun to watch that I don't even watch all five hours of it\nBut you know people don't watch congressional hearings like I was like I I'm not a I was not a news though for the daily and you I wouldn't have dreamed of wanting to watch a congressional hearing and I think one of the things that is so\nPowerful that that you as a as a narrator on the daily is that you can make it fun in a way that like I'm sort of I I can be can be tricked into watch into watching a congressional hearing\nAnd and and and this hearing to see how the context of if you remember what happened was they took it was going to be this\nThis moment where we're going to have a we were going to have Congress really holding Facebook accountable for what happened well it's sort of what happened in the election and in Cambridge Analytica but the but this moment where they they could really they could ask\nHow they how would they use us yeah yeah yeah but I I think what\nWas striking about fat clipping that ... is that they're not Nazis right right and and they're not like these like Russian actors who are trying to interfere in the election and it's something that that feels so much close like their discussion of like why are they doing this\nAnd that and that that that that in our backyard feels\nHarder to me to root out um because it's a much easier to blame it on Russia or to be like a you know they they want to run our democracy but what about these kids today not care about the fact that it might scripted democracy\nWell we we asked them about that it was me and Andy ... other producers and um and we asked them kind of like\nHow do you how do you feel about this and they weren't like look you know\nThere was a market and we found a market um and people want what they want and we're just gonna keep giving it to them it has been a little bit harder for them recently because I'm Facebook has made some changes that I think are are really smart to sort of dial to turn the dial on on sort of that kind of viral contests\nBut what about these kids do they not care about the fact that it might scripted democracy\nWell we we asked them about that it was me and Andy ... other producers and um and we asked some kind of like how do you how do you feel about this and they were like look you know\nThere was a market and we found a market\nUm and people want what they want and we're just gonna keep giving it to them it has been a little bit harder for them recently because\nI'm faced because made some changes that I think are are really smart to sort of dial to turn the dial on on sort of that kind of viral contests actually having a little bit harder time these days getting the kind of audience that they once had and they're starting to experiment with other types of stories um because the the outrage machine doesn't work as quite as well as it used to\nAnd I'm Kevin this has been a very serious discussion it's been kind of heavy most daily discussions are kind of heavy yesterday and I think before we even think about turning to our saviors and the audience for you and I we want to have lightened things up just a touch that's\nOne of the things about making a new show with a new house to hasn't been an audio is that you learn their verbal tax and as I'm sure you all know Michael ... has a pretty recognizable verbal attack\n... [noise] it comes in many forms it's a it's quite polarizing people feel many different ways about it\nDid you guys get like a lot of emails about the ...\nYeah [noise]\nWe do we get at least one or two a week yeah about the ... I have a pretty\nI have a somewhat of noxious reply to the people who don't like it was it like type ... H\nM M M M M M M [noise]\nIt's not just as a producer that using that email every time because it feels like you're saying the same joke over and over again\nSo I think you should sell as a ring tone though like you know [laughter]\nSo what's interesting about it it's like oh you are to kill it and why this weird take I have I mean let's talk about why I actually do the right\nWhich is um when you're a journalist and you're on the phone with somebody and they're they're just sort of drawing on and on or saying wonderful things there aren't that many ways of affirming them or making them think you're still listening\n\nYou could do a lot of things without agreeing with thing you can do the dishes you can do I mean you can go off and do a lot of things it's it's really more about the ... you can talk more with your mother\n... [laughter] really ... it's about it's about the fact\nThat you can be talking to someone that you don't agree with you and they can be saying something that you don't want to affirm but you want to\nSay I hear you and you want the audience you know they are still there and that and I think a lot of say right yeah yeah and when we talk to people but saying that sounds like you're especially to white nationalist do I sound like you're affirming them I I feel\nVery firm personally when I go on that when I go to the daily I mean it's like I spent an hour the guys you make them sound very love are it's just an hour yeah and and and I get a lot of affirming ...\nAnd I feel like I honestly I should be paying your co pay for the [laughter] it's a good experience I I Hope everyone in this room some day has a chance to be affirmed by these guys [noise]\nOh back sometimes there is something that any brown you made yeah waiting to them yes and we're wondering if it's anyone's birthday tonight\nThey birthday was\nYesterday that's pretty good okay this one for you we have a birthday [noise]\n\n[laughter] it's a good experience I I Hope everyone in this room someday has a chance to be affirmed by these guys [noise]\nOh back from them there was something that any brown you may yet waiting to them yes and we're wondering if it's anyone's birthday tonight they reduce\nYesterday that's pretty good okay this one for you we have a birthday [noise]\n\nSo uh [noise] if\nIf there is an explanation it was my birthday it whenever they an anti brown made\nWell I also didn't have to change any of the pages of the\n[noise]\nYou just in the right pitches it's I just took one interview and took all the ... or ... or is\n... it was with my youth\n[laughter] in the in the drop off a folder and now there is so there is now there is but I I loved ones are like ... [noise]\nMy favorite [noise]\nAnd I know they were going to turn to you and I\nWe are and before we do that I Want to thank you both coming all the way out here to be truly think\n[noise]\nSort of come to life and the questions Hi I'm just kind of\nWorks well with the last question I was wondering when you described a slow news day what if a lot is happening in the world and I love how you do the ending where you're like here's where else what else happens today how do you prioritize what stories do on any given day\nSo in the morning something a number of the team goes to the nine thirty which is also called the front page meeting where they discuss\nWhat is coming that day I'm what you expect maybe we're expecting someone to resign are expecting this\nHearing to happen ... going to do an announcement owned by the way the science desk 'cause it's interesting feature that's coming out and like the night and the magazines going to release\nThis profile um and and we we leave there with like a ... with a rough outline of of of what what we want to cover and I think when we think about a story that is a daily story\nUm is is that there is a story for the daily\nIt has to be a news event that you either must on you have to understand something complicated in order to understand what's happening in this moment if it's a development in the mail or investigation that we've you know\nWe're adding a detailed to a store we've told a bunch of times we put that in the what we call the headlines at the end of the show but if it's something where you're like oh man this is\nComplicated this changes the way that I understand something or we need to tell the story of this person before we like that so that you can understand the department of education and this new development we will we will devote a show to that and there are times where we don't want to do it but we have to blow up the show because\nBecause Donald Trump with our president because news happened and and we resist for hours where we are kind of like\nYou know no no no no nothing you can make a headline\nAnd this happened this happened a few weeks ago where we were making the series on family separation\nThis is complicated this changes the way that I understand something or we need to tell the story of this person before we like it so that you can understand the department of education and this new development we will we will devoted show to that and there are times where we don't want to do it but we have to blow up the show because\nBecause Donald Trump was our president because news happen and and we resist for hours where we are kind of like\nNo no no nothing we can make a headline\nAnd this happened this happened a few weeks ago where we were making the\nSeries on family separation divided with Caitlin Dickerson end any corral and we had three days planned and we had the the stories are made by ... by two of my colleagues and I'm an after the first day there was the the Manafort\nAnd Cohen guilty pleas and and and conviction and we didn't want to cover it because we had this thing planned and a member of the mass\nHad who's one of the most senior editors of the whole newspaper came down\nTo the daily and was like as a lesson [laughter] can't you can't ignore that and we also were like you know\n... [noise]\nI'll tell you will like sometimes we defined a show by what we would never recover yeah and we decided as a rule we would never cover a presidential tweet as an episode because like is just\nNot enough [noise] ah [noise]\nI don't know what I mean if you think about ... plot character suspend moral speak like please you know just like it's in Congress with who we are\nBut I Will say that there was a there was the day that that um the whole comment was made we we traveled at the same question of like your comment toll comment was made the um we we struggle with the idea of like how do we do an episode about a sentence\nAnd we all are like I don't know like what are we going to say like it that's rude that like\nYou know it's like it's not that much to say about it\nUntil we until we realized that there is like that there was a story that led up to that moment that like there there had been these these two senators from across the aisle who were coming to terms office to present a bipartisan immigration deal and then out of the wings came all of these immigration hawks\nWho are like super conservative and they were they were walking into the oval yes in a surprise addition to the to the meeting and and they're whispering in Trump's\nEar and pulling and in this direction and and these two bipartisan senators are saying no no what about our deal and in this moment he says this comment and it was\nIn and that was the daily story and we were like okay we got to do it without an episode and and I I I feel like when when we when we can contextualize a tweet in that way where like the sweet matters because no choice [laughter] to seven are are in the day all the time I go around in the in the here's where those traditional sense yeah", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "year": "2018", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "10"}
