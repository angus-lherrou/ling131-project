[laughter] and\nThere were so many wonderful actors that I Wish I had a chance\nNow to be working with that came into the flying them because they were doing little guest us because that was spring buying and yeah I mean the great spring buying and then I was\nSo young men I don't think I could stop and say oh my God I'm working with spring buying an ... because it and then when I look in the guest list of like the flying none I go what did you ever get knowledge these people's bills and I don't think I was capable of it when you were pretty young and I was\nYoung but it was sort of like in my own kind of fall trying to get through\nOr are there are there are rules that you owe the church that you are sort of not on the kind of greatest hit list of things that you think\nI'm a you know back roll still for whatever reason maybe not 'cause it's a broader 'cause you bought you did such good work necessarily but something that you just feel like I'm proud of that on you know or something I I\nMade a something happened to me while I was playing that role\nWell something always happened to me when I was working you know I was working number one um but I but I don't think so it was odd my career was odd uh I I wasn't offered a whole lot of things I didn't\nKind of greatest hit list things that you think I'm a you know that role still for whatever reason maybe not 'cause it's a favorite or 'cause you thought you did such good work necessarily but something that you just feel like I'm proud of that I'm you know or something I I made of something happened to me when I was playing that\nRole well something always happened to me when I was working you know I was working number one um but I but I don't think\nSo it was on my career was odd uh I I wasn't offered a whole lot of things I didn't turn down a whole lot of things but um I was lucky enough that once I got into the motion picture business which took me a while I'm\nAt least one script would come to me um every year but in in most cases they they were something that I was glad to do but then there was some real ... and like [noise] what was I thinking probably I was thinking I needed to earn some money so\nI had so I had to do it you know like beyond the site and then if you like that either\n[laughter]\nNo no no no\nWell as you write in your wonderful book which I could not recommend more in pieces sell his new memoir which is a sensational book you write about\nHow digital flying none in a way got your branded as a TV I forget it only ran one season forth I'm flying on rent for three seasons so you've stumped for years about kind of work and\nTook a while for film folks to say oh she's not just the flying digital I mean she can do is you know\nIn my heart I'll always be a flying kitchen so [laughter]\nUm [laughter]\nNo and I had done um actually I did three sitcoms series starting three TV series by the time I was twenty five years so I was really you know indelibly on they do not call us we'll call you list\nAnd heart rate up at the top and I'm certainly it in pieces\nThe when the book and the reason I even talk about those um periods of my life and that was that the movement of my career I'm is because I needed to look at my own a habitual patterns\nMy own handed down um history that has taken me a lifetime to understand and the beginnings of my work and my uh career worth so much a part of me becoming I'm not an actor but me\nWell I mean it's interesting that a lot of the book I mean why this is not just to stand in showbiz men wore a lot of the book is devoted to those early years because as you just as you say it's really it's a\nIt's a coming of age or it's a it's a personal evolution story as much as it is a you know a a show business more really is not that at all and and we were talking a bit for 'em you set out to write this book not really knowing where it was going you started writing what six seven years ago yeah\nIt took me seven years and I I wrote it I'm without really having a notion or a clear idea that I was going to publish it or that I Would have the guts\nTo publish it um I've ruined it for myself because I needed to find out something that I didn't know and um\nI I think I had been ... with it you know it's all going with it for ... for a long time because I was always taking writing classes at you know us UCLA Extension or\nI'm going to writers workshops over like\nUm without really having a notion or a clear idea that I was going to publish it or that I Would have the guts\nTo publish it um I've ruined it for myself because I needed to find out something that I didn't know and um I I I think I had been noodle ing with it you know it evolved thing with that for for a long time because I was always taking writing classes\nAt you know us UCLA Extension\nOr I'm going to a writer's workshops over like during the weekends and writing things in in little snippets of this would come flying out of my head um but when my mother passed\nAway I felt an urgency to find something that I didn't know where it was I didn't I thought I'd done all the things I was supposed to do I have the conversations we heal the wounds if there were any what's done we did such a good job but something\nWas deeply disquieting and it wasn't that I was just grieving that too\nBut it was that something was festering on me and I had to I had to pull out all of the pieces and lay him on the table and put them together and see\nIf I could understand a story that he didn't know before and and and to do that I had to learn the craft because it was in learning the craft of acting that I was really able to find pieces of myself and ... ...\n... one of the things I'm really glad we're all include is I'm I'm Glad I got some applause ... the uh the mini series you did in back in Nineteen Seventy six and you say in the ... more of that that was the first time you had a glimpse of what it meant to be in for the character\nAnd you see there's actually a wine and simple about that character being a piece of multiple multiple personalities story so what if you talk a little bit about that moment of how that started to maybe open you up both as an actor and I was a person who's well [noise]\nThen there was another workshop experience while you were in the flying none you started going to lose ...\n... yeah that's what\nWhy did you think I mean were you so frustrated playing\nNo ... no I didn't know it was there I mean when I when I started to get you when I was I'm ... by the time the pilot's old I was Eighteen by then uh I had never been out of the state I'd never been on an airplane God Knows I didn't have any education I I was\nJust you know sort of literally numb to it to a degree\nUm except I can ask I Swear to God I could act I swear to God and um when I was\nDoing the none um I which I didn't want to do 'em\nAt all because I had by then started to see this you know little sliver of tomorrow a little sliver started to come in of\nThe of the perfect place to perhaps you know perhaps I'll perhaps um\nAnd then my stepfather came and I had turned down a series I didn't want to do it I mean it was Nineteen sixty six\nEverybody was running around naked in eating ... [laughter] I didn't I didn't want to be dressed as a ... [noise]\n\nDidn't necessarily want to be running around naked but I didn't want to be justice and not either the half way\nThe place of perhaps you know perhaps I'll perhaps um\nAnd then my stepfather came and I had turned down a series I didn't want to do it I mean it was Nineteen sixty six everybody was running around\nNaked and eating ... [laughter]\nI didn't I didn't want to be dressed as a ... [noise]\n\nI didn't necessarily want to be running around naked but I didn't want to be justice in either the halfway position [laughter] so I I I I\nTurned it down and turned it down and my step father came over and said if I if I didn't do it um they had called him and if I didn't do it might never work again and I went\nOh really and I got scared so it was the beginning of of learning that every time I made a decision because I was scared it it wasn't the right one\nUm [noise] and I felt defeated from day one I uh I ...\nI started to be very depressed I didn't know that it was I was depressed because in Nineteen sixty six I didn't know what depression was\nUm and maybe I maybe I Would have been all of this would have been bubbling up anyway because I'm becoming a young adult and whatever complicated childhood I had was confusing me and just coming out I don't know but it ... it manifest itself and in eating disorders and um\nYou know just then I then I then I went to a doctor and he put me on diet pills because of that at the time they could do that and they were like this big just straight Dexedrine and\nOkay now we're happy everybody thought whoa why does it somebody tell me about\nBut then when I hands were shaking so bad in a scene that I couldn't lift up a cup of tea in the scene because I looked like I was really not doing well I and I found myself drinking a cup of tea holding the sauce or end the cup\nTogether [noise] and the the nuns were going that's an interesting way of doing that so I I actually was\nAlways something that stepped in and stopped me from going down these and you know clips and so one day towards the end of the first year I'm just trying to charge through this\nAnd all of a sudden I'm standing in the mother superior to office and all the other nuns around one of those normal scenes and all of the norm nuns around and we're talking\nAbout [laughter] [noise] and taking it very seriously [laughter] ah [noise] all of a sudden I\nI put my hands in my face and I just pulled it it just folded up\nAnd in in my head down in my lab\nI started whispering please let me go home please let me go home please let me go home\nAnd he kept trying trying to stop and voice inside my head saying get I get up get off just pop up and go well\nI don't know what that was it was weird [laughter]\nI couldn't do it I couldn't make myself get up I just sat there saying he's let me go home please let me go home\nAnd all of a sudden I felt this arm on his hands you know pull up my arm not not like he was trying\nTo pull me I'm pull my hands away or you know try to talk to me it was it was kind of a sport like pulling me up and I heard this voice not loud but a voice that you didn't argue with say get her car she finished with it\n[laughter] I couldn't do it\nI couldn't make myself get up I just sat there saying please let me go home please let me go home\nAnd all of a sudden I felt this arm on his hands you know pull up my arm not not like he was trying to\nPull me I'm pull my hands away or\nYou know try to talk to me it was it was kind of a support like pulling me up and I heard this voice not loud but a voice that you didn't argue with\nSay get her car she finished for the day and it was Madeline sure with the mother superior\nAnd she she led me I had my hands still in my face 'cause I was too embarrassed and to see how horrified everybody must have been um and and she let me towards the big sliding\nDoors open to the sound stage and I could hear the honk honk is the thing rolled open and and she pushed my head down I got him some vehicle that I never I never looked at the driver all the way home I was to mortified\nAnd then he took me home and I I think I was home the next day I come to work like\nBuddy how are you off\nYou know everything's fine they just ate that hotdog I shut up you know and it [noise] and then towards the end of that day Madeleine pulled me into the back I'm\nInto a dark coordinator in the corner and the sound stage and stuffed a piece of paper in my hand and she said the address is very close and you can you can come to stay after work I Will meet you there is the actors studio ... do you know what it is and I said\nWell you know thinking\nNah not so much that I really know what it was but I kind of heard about it and she said I Will not take\nNo for an answer so I met her there and it was really um\nThe beginning of a huge change in my life because I could then begin to hear myself again 'cause if I could get to the work I Would be All right it was when the war was taken away from me that I began to drown and um\nAnd then I started working at least offered very intensely and um I desperately wanted to learn a craft and\nInitially he was quite taken with you he was it it seemed like another you know an another at the Providence would deliver you're going to but it didn't go that way with the stress or did it well it didn't it didn't\nIt was like he had it all planned out but um he was really I'm I'm a magnificent teacher but he can be a little rough\nHe could be rough and it could be ... you know what we would sit in the ... and watch other scenes and sometimes you know you you feel the other actors go oh my God oh my God how to recover from that you know when when he would talk to some people and he from the\nGet go with me he was incredibly um supportive and um I went ... you know as much as I could when I wasn't working and you know it was sort of known that I was one of his\nYou know chosen ones or something and um so I and I started eventually when the none was over I thank God I [laughter] I started I'm going\nHis then the ... Institute was he had\nAnd his wife and I had started so that I could work with him more intensely I think it was three times a week they were um just him teaching in doing um excess extended exercises with just with ... and and it was an extraordinary time and then one day\nOne of his you know chosen ones or something and um so I and I started eventually\nWhen the none was over I thank God I [laughter] I started I'm\nGoing to his then the ... Institute was\nHe had and his wife and I had started so that I could work with him more intensely I think it was three times a week they were um just him teaching and doing 'em exes extended exercises with just with Italy and and it was an extraordinary time and then one\nDay as I'm also so striving to move my career on because it's going nowhere unless I make it go somewhere and I told myself that I could never blame the them the them\nThe industry the the the unfairness of it all the the the something\nIt it could never be that if I wasn't worried want it to be it had to be because I wasn't\nGood enough and that when I got good enough\nThat would just change and it was just you know\nShe's forward so slowly and one day I was doing a scene I'm friendly at the Institute and you were supposed to um\nBe generous enough to win another actor asked you to be in a scene with them even though it was something you did not want to do in a million trillion years you just did it anyway and did your best because you were supposed to participate with\nYour fellow students and I had done that with them and not to suit asked me to to play in a in a two character play called the horn the player I think it is and of course I was not the horror [laughter] I was it was supposed to be like the two sides of the\nSame person um and one of them was like the Marilyn Monroe ish character and one of them was the none issue carrots [noise] guess which one she wanted me to fight [noise] and so automatically I didn't want to do it but I ... you know I was you know going to do the best they could and but it was about but I wasn't\nReally taking it seriously and I and by then I was kind of cocky I was kind of short myself with lead well you know just going to do a little fancy footwork chair and a little you know a fair and I'll be just you know\nShe and she talked about the laughter and boy oh boy do I remember\nThe laughter um you remember the sounds are and you know that that they are the things that get imprinted on your your brain she knows so much about brain when when also fear in danger and are involved and it's like pea TST and so\nSo much of the book was trying to see it so clearly for me because\nThey're the patterns that in childhood sort of a ... there were survival mechanisms but as an adult they get in my way they've gotten my way and they no longer serve me and I can't I Can't untangle them um there's a saying that what's what's\nFired together is wired together and I'm a\nTherapist a psychological saying that that as a child when several emotions strong emotions are happening at the same time I'm like for instance with my stepfather and needed his love and affection he was magically was bigger than life and my real father ignored me and he\nMy stepfather just didn't\nTurn in was affectionate than\n... um there's a saying that what's\nWhat's fired together is wired together and I'm a\nTherapist a psychological saying that that as a child when several emotions strong emotions are happening at the same time I'm like for instance with my stepfather and needed his\nLove and affection he was magically was bigger than life and my real father ignored me and he my stepfather\nJust didn't turn in was affectionate and so as a child I needed that kind of affection but I felt terrified\nAnd so danger was always connected with love from me\nMaybe he'll stop man he was literally arrest federal yes so you know it's taken it takes me it's taken me a lifetime to figure out how I can just connect those two because wait a minute that's just those two don't really go together Sally you can still\nHave a relationship with somebody and not feel in danger on the ... while\nThe other big figure a course in this in this triangulation is your mother who and what she knew or didn't know during during the course of the Senate and it's very moving the way you write at the end about\nYou're coming to some accommodation was about that not necessarily a complete its models sweep of some live what happens between your mother but you you you love your mother\nDeeply um I'm In the complex way that the mothers and daughters sometimes it's particularly when there's abuse happening I'm the mother knew something but didn't know at all it's it's really quite\nUm it's quite extraordinary and I just I Wonder if if as you were writing it did you know all of these things before you could I mean did you discover nose on the writing\nBut I discovered in the writing I discovered so much in the writing and it was hard to do is hard to get it was hard to move away\nFrom it it became you know addicted to it I'm ... and uh I I I ... you know I Would have it in\nMy pockets and my shoes they had because I didn't want to be away from it and I'd be drawn\nA way to go to work and do other things which was probably\nA good idea and I come back and it would be sort of fresh but I I\nThe big ingredients the big things I was looking for I didn't discover until I made myself go back and look at I made myself read my journals that I hadn't written something I had written a very key thing in my journal um\nYou know only like Fifteen Years prior to this and I wrote it down it happened I wrote it down and completely ... from my brain and yet something in the newly needed to write it down and it was only in doing this that I went\nWait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait one minute and went and found the journal and went and got went\nOh my God and could peace some things together that we're in pieces [laughter] um [noise] and\nI understand um\nAnd I think ultimately what I was looking for was\nWhat I felt about my mother um I did not want to feel um that she had left and ah um that she wouldn't taught me first I needed to haunt me and then I I thought do I am I feeling angry\nI don't know and then ultimately I'm at the very end and when I done all of this for seven years and I was sitting with my youngest son Sam I'm who was the only one who I'd let read\n... what I was looking for was what I felt about my mother\nUm I did not want to feel um that she had left and ah um\nThat she wouldn't taught me first I needed to haunt me and then I I thought do I am I feeling angry\nI don't know and then ultimately I'm at the very end and when I done all of this for seven years and I was sitting with my youngest son Sam I'm who was the only one who I'd let me ... ... ... actually I Would read it to him as I was putting the last chapter trying to figure out what how it fit together\nAnd they said why did I Do all of this what is this about what did I learn I've just something I've looked or something and I all this time and I still don't know what it was and he said oh my God mom\nDon't see how different you are then you were seven years ago how differently you feel about yourself\nAnd I went oh God\nYes you're right I Do and that really is the end of the book it's the last\nUnderstanding of it that I write I'm about my mother and um I realized that they didn't need her to haunt me uh I'm fine without her and that someday she will come and get me [noise]\nLet me just switch gears hold them to ask you about some of the people that you've worked with a really funny you're close to what you mentioned Joanne Woodward and some gas talk a little bit about what the I mean it's such a [noise] the two of you it's just a ... yeah and that it's just really mark will tell me about working with with her on on the well she\nUm and I was lucky enough to later work with her fence phenomenal husband Paul I mean they were this this extraordinary ... she was so\nShe was so everything that I wanted to be um she was a real actor that's really all she cared about she never cared about\nYou know being famous or looking really pretty or she'd just one of the work get me to the work and she boy did she know how to work and she was just dead on and there was no there was no ego involved it was\nAlways about the scene and I'm ... I've been lucky enough to work with a few people like that but um I think Joanne Joanne really was the first and um you know she just was one of the few people in my life really\nYou know sit here take my hand and I got it and uh so I she just was at\nA gym no you you in ... in in order ... really is a great or it's just a great\nYou know the Jewish class a Jewish guy from New York and and the character that you play that there's real chemistry is a sort of a cliche but there's something more than ... physics storm or do you what what was it like working with with him on that\nHe was you know he's again a wonderful guy and a wonderful actor but I think the chemistry that you see between run and I is really I'm already written I ... I'm and basically you know slaves through Ron I'm because\n... was came into my life than it was such a huge influence in my life from then on um\n[noise] and so it's it's interesting um that he's so I'm ... and\nSelf around a ... a performance and and um and a production but he's never eaten doesn't take over it or anything but um I think the the Enron and I really\n... um and what can you know slaves through Ron I'm because ... was came into my life than it was such a huge influence in my life from then on um\n[noise] and so it's it's interesting um that he's so I'm ... and\nSelf around a ... a performance and and um and a production but he's never eaten doesn't take over it or anything but um I think the the Enron and I really loved working with each other but I was seeing Marty\nWhen I Lived at Ron ... I'm not how I adored him\nWas was he the most influential director for you would you say\nI guess you know absolutely ... even though I've been lucky enough to work with some wonderful directors but he it was the role in and how we and how he um enabled me and he'd come from the actors\nStudio and and I'm the same way that you know they've he he was close friends with Leon 'cause then and all that and he had a language that I understood\nAnd I didn't have to decipher his language to into my own I'm acting language and he thought the exactly the same acting language and so it was fun for us to to play chess games with each other and see if we get out maneuver each other you know and um I don't know that I ever really\nQuite had that again ... ...\nAh when Lincoln the possible of Lincoln came up you that determination as you've been talking about really went into high gear you are determined to get that part in originally Liam Neeson was was cast in the role and you went after you really lobbying Spielberg that you wanted to play this role and it looked like it might\nSlip out of your hands on by God you weren't going to let it happen right you are you sort of pretty much insisted on it for him [laughter] I'm Daniel Day Lewis of course famously you know stays in the character ... what was it like for you working with a\nRemarkable after it was a particular we'll\nSee I ... I Love that I mean that's perfect for me I left that\nUm I Would you know in in my own little way um I always would stay in character but I Would always hide it because I never felt I had the power to be Daniel Day Lewis and to take over and say everybody's got to follow these rules you know and\nSo everybody follow the rules even character but he lives alone\nUm and you know and and and I and he's ... he's a phenomenal guy um but he he made it so that when we came on the set", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "17"}
