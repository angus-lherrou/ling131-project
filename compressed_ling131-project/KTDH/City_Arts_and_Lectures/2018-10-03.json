to introduce you to most in how made a motion and I have met only a couple of times over the years but I've always had the sense that his books in my books I constantly many chattering away together and\nAs the years but I've always had the sense that his books and my books I constantly merrily chattering away together and my books like the books of most right as I Know has always been hugely admiring of motions books\nBut nowadays they're a little bit jealous [laughter] sick is in his last two novels he's really created\nA whole new form of the global powerful\nAnd he tells he is very rooted emphasize stories about a specific man and a specific woman but you also get the sense he's telling the story of millions of people from everywhere and the books\nAre deeply of the times and entirely out of time in the same breath\nHis most recent book exit west really covers travel bans Brexit and even the me too movement before any of us have had if there's a his novels or bulletins from the future\n[noise] but it's a deeper level I think of most in as kind of a surveillance camera posted high above the U.S and keeping observance but sympathetic watch I'm not just Pakistan in Palo Alto but London Sidney Madden\nCash Tokyo and there's a lot about views about vistas in his new novel but really I don't think that's a single contemporary writer who gives us the aerial view as medicine does so it's really an honor for me to welcome us an homage to the city or some let your stage\n[noise]\nWelcome thank thank thank you for coming here now so you just had me drone on about this new form you've created and I've always wanted to use it seems like with each new book you create a new form do you spend a lot of time thinking about the shape of the book before you need and again I think\nI Do um uh but but very often the form I think that a book will take us not to form that winds up picking 'em\nUh it seems to me that each story has an appropriate for um that that you need to find a way in which a story can do what\nIt is meant to do and uh and you know when I began writing or with my first ... smoke or I thought you know\nI was trying to respond to very judgmental society that was Pakistan and uh and so this idea of a trial whether we have to judge with the characters were up to and the characters are behaving in ways that they weren't supposed to or felt very natural but then each book has sort of had its own\nProject in the form that was associated with them\nAnd do you determine totally not to repeat yourself you figure I've done this once I Move on it's partly that\nI think um it's partly a I've done it once and I moved on but it's partly that I Do think that there is a form appropriate\nTo each one so in in the case is often fundamentalists yes I definitely wanted to move away from the multiple narrator a way of telling a noble to malt smoke was but also I thought that that mobile because it was about the way in which we um are\nIn a a highly frightened or anxiety induced age are constantly a nervous about each other um that it would make that nervousness central to itself and and that it would tell half\nOf a very tense story and to read it would be placed in a position of hearing this Pakistani character talk to an American presumably American stranger or never hear the Americans responses and\nHearing this Pakistani character talk to an American presumably American stranger or never hear the Americans responses and a and this is a fundamentally unsettling physician and and so what are you going to make of this how will you the reader stabilize this do you believe the Pakistani what do you think is going on\nAnd in the process of stabilizing you the reader asked to\nUm take insufficient information and create a narrative and as you do that as you filmed a novel in your imagination in your mind um you or reveal yourself to yourself and and so it seemed to me that that was a way\nTo look at the um the suspicion um that we are living in a by\nReflecting back at the reader or movements putting the video on trial yeah well ... ... yes I mean are on trial and maybe it is stronger than I Will do I would yeah but in ... absolutely I mean ... I suppose less that it just putting the reader on trial\nAnd more that it is potentially enabling the reader to be aware of themselves in the process of reading um so it's less a judgment and more of a mirror and um and and that hopefully that is a more useful position\nUm for us to scrutinize the suspicion within um in this time when we were told to be so suspicious and face up to the feelings that we'd pretend to hassle yeah yeah and also and also the ease with which\nI'm we can have an ... an artist constructed for us so I often tell people that you know\nA a multiple of Britain about looking for The Mentalist and called it a thriller and when I'm told this I said yes it's a thriller in which nothing really happened [noise] right and um and the reason why it's a thriller is because we were all really thrilled before we began the book um we live in a world that we imagined to be a thriller\nUntil somebody gives a certain tonality if somebody gives us a few sketched images I'm a certain way of speaking um we conjure fourth\nYeah uh the thriller from within us and uh and to me that's important because I'm a ... you know it may be that we live in the world that is much less unsafe that when you imagine and I'm\nA and the dollar eagerness to imagine it's an safety is in fact the biggest danger that we that we face in\nAnd says the political situation has given us a position in which you and I on the possessing types and they strike fear in the hearts\nOf little faith I mean we looked like potential say yes I mean I I I I'm reminded of that you know from time to time when I walked through security a\nCheckpoint in America and I suddenly put on about six inches of hide and a hundred pounds of muscle you know and I've become deeply threatening a first and it must be incredibly close ... screened and occasionally hold off aircraft when they're already on the\nRunway I'm a ... in that sense it's quite empowering but um [noise] but uh you know or you should be careful what you wish for us\n[laughter] yeah I used to get ... every time I tend to Japan and I happened\nTo your dress appropriately I mean this is the thing that you a certain point you have to think you know how old are you going to respond to this you know uh what reading material you carry you know what a [laughter]\nOr or you know what kind of um what will you reveal yes um and this I think is actually a very important because now we live in a world where are we haven't recently we've been told that the uh agents will have the right to inspect your computer or your mobile phone I'm at the ...\nWe haven't recently we've been told that the uh agents will have the right to inspect your computer or your mobile phone I'm at the border\nAnd because it's such a deeply private things right that you have your your children's photographs you have your love letters you have um\nPictures of people who passed away you know you're in a most personal life and these places and we're saying that somebody who not because there's some sort of probable cause or court sanctioned a reason but because they simply take a dislike too you\nCan read much about in the ...\nDo you think though that the distances and differences between places getting great hit because at the end ... knowledge forty years ago somebody had couldn't imagine she knew everything about Pakistan now damages on ... we know that\nWell I think what's happening is since you mentioned screens and how we know things um I think what's happening is that\nThe screen based or a system of information that we're now engaging with a is profoundly different from what's come full so what has happened to us is in this technological cultural moment um we have seen simultaneously um\nThe the transformation of of news or to entertain\nWe have seen simultaneously um the the transformation of of news er into entertainment or into a profit seeking entertainment business I'm a profit seeking entertainment business seeks to maximize attention\nUm the goal of this is to have as many viewers or or or readers or ... people who liked or retweeted um the piece of information\nNow how'd you get that um the way that human beings are designed is we are designed to privilege and prioritize and give a greater importance to threatening information\nUm so uh you know if there's a flash of orange behind the trees or we could say well it's probably not a tiger but we are we are designed to say that that might be a tiger because our ancestors who said it probably wasn't a tiger have all been eaten by tigers and [noise]\nAnd the genes have not been passed on to us and that's what those of us who are left um for the for the basis for to stay alive we we privilege\nFrightening information in the same way that if you walk down the street your street every day or for a year and a\nThousand people say hello but of course that you you will forget every single one of those fellows but one person who shouts of racist epithet a Jew you might remember for your entire life because that was a hostile frightening potentially threatening thing we privileges that information\nSo then you have a profit making sort of enterprise um that wants to our attention what do we give our attention to we give our attention to threats and so what begins to occur is that we are presented with threats\nNow um it's not that we just open the newspaper and counter the threat so we turn the TV but now because of our phones we are receiving disinformation about threats on new continuous basis that is fundamentally destabilizing I think to the human organism\nIt has created in this moment the sense that we are so menacing to each other um that uh that there's no way forward it has a crippling I'm a excess uh addiction um ah\nTo threat perception um which causes us to recoil\nFrom the future because the future is full of threats and would that enables\nA this recording from the future and pessimism would that enables\nIs a kind of nostalgic politics and dismissed out the politics of spreading all over the world and this politics tells us don't look forward look back let's make Islam great again you know let's make you know Britain great again and you know I Believe in America that might be something like that also have um [noise]\nAnd so um and so we're presented with ... let's go back we cannot do because time does not work in that way um that's the pernicious environment in which you find ourselves and so when you say you know that we know more about each other\nWe may know more about each other but we certainly are experiencing is a very heightened sense that we are threatening to each other um and I think that is completely misguided but also self fulfilling\nAnd there's also the adoption at the screen and had I been in the car with you and your wife have offered an even more useless suggestion for title which is the longing or the poignancy of cell phones\nReading that I thought part of what's going on in your book is that people in Pakistan, India everywhere and seeing images of the promised land and the promise life the sitting those images and then finding than others 'cause you think that you can see them that company can touch them\nI'd invest precisely right I mean in in the ... of the action presumes that the people in the audience of a familiar with it so I'm In the novel these two characters say than the other fleet this city where they live which are descending into terrible violence\nIt seems that when the audience of a familiar with it so I'm In the novel these two got to say the ... they flee\nThis city where they live which are descending into terrible violence and the novel a base the laws of physics as we understand them for the most part with one slight exception which is that in the novel these black doors have begun to open and and these black indoors um for example the door to you about from here in San Francisco or to your closet\nOne day it becomes an opaque black rectangle\nAnd if you push yourself through that you find yourself no longer\nIn uh San Francisco but in Kyoto or the whole or or ... or softball or some other place far away\nAnd then people begin to move through these and then ... billions of people move and the next several centuries of migration code within a year or two um so as far as cell\nPhones are concerned you know these black doors if people said oh this is magical realism other says some you know science fiction um you know perhaps uh but uh I think\nThat the prevalence of these small black doors that we each carry with us these little black rectangles which has the screen of our phones [noise] um and that except for you because I Know it doesn't have one I think almost everyone in this room I'm Will have one of these rectangles black rectangles either in the in the pocket or in the\nHandbag or in a backpack or a on the person I'm\nAnd these things called out to us you know like uh the ring calls out to a\nCall them you know my precious and uh it is a seminar tension and we sort of some of your finger on your phone right now as I said the and the um you know you're experiencing\nThis lord of the rings like a a connection and and uh and the anxiety when we don't have a phone with us but what is the phone make possible the phone is a portal\nThrough which our consciousness departs and the geographic location about body\nThat is what the phone is when my children send me a video what they've done today um and I look at that video I Am seeing Pakistan and I'm thinking about the whole but equally I could be reading an article about Japan or about India um about a Brazil\nOr about you know efforts to colonize Mars or the fictional history of West arose and I will be in these places and so um\nThis is the will of going into\nAnd and for me the notion that well if this is what technology is doing is is it is sort of obliterated in a um\nGeographical physical barriers um collapsing distance um then isn't not a worthwhile imagining what if I bought this could go through ... um isn't that where we're sort of headed and and then that enables what you're talking about\nThis is yeah except as so many bad as it's not much of anything and so that pull up all the countries that will never admit you yes and as you were saying at the F ... well the the [noise] um\nThis is what remains to be seen so the porters are not being created the question is what we do when the people come on I think it will not be the case that people will choose not to go now that people can see they will come the question is what do we have on the other side of the dome\nI'm\n[noise] ah I tend to think that human history is over time I'm a journey towards greater equality and so\nWe have seen that I'm In this country a hundred and fifty years ago a African American people were ah legally ah deemed to be slaves um less than a century ago women couldn't vote\nBut now we believe that the people of would be called different races or which is itself\nUm less than a century ago women couldn't vote but now we believe that\nPeople have would be called different races or which is itself an interesting concept but that's just use that people have different races are equal people have different genders are equal or people of different or no religious belief should be treated equally gay people than straight people should be treated equally um it seems to me\nA\nUtterly unsustainable that we should believe in these qualities and we should all the same time say I'm the child born\nIn San Francisco and a child born in Sao paolo should have fundamentally different titles to where they can live and what kind of life they can enjoy the child in Mogadishu in Milwaukee should have fundamental because of the lottery of where they were born one should stay in a place where they could be killed violently\nAnd have nothing to eat and the other should be able to live in a place that is safe and whatever because of what you know what is this principle um and I think\nThat in two or three hundred years people will look back at this moment in human history\nAnd think that we who prevented a refugees especially in migration um they will think that we are as barbaric as we imagine that slave holders were a hundred and fifty years ago and so um and so this is my view now\nUm when you say that OK well\nPeople can move the cutting because we're stopping them right or you can move a container full of you know T shirts or from Asia to America for almost nothing you could move people for almost nothing too if you wanted to um\nWe're stopping them but what we are discovering is that the reason why all of these equality is built on each of the racial equality gender equality sexual orientation\nReligious beliefs et cetera all build on each other is because it is impossible to deny equality and sustain the other qualities as hard to deny one [noise] so what happens is in our process of saying well people are trying to come and we're going to stop them but yet we believe in human equality something has to give\nWe have to admit that we don't actually believe in human equality and that's a slippery slope because what occurs is we we begin to construct societies capable of keeping migrants out that requires a militarized borders\nUh\nImagine you know pre suppositions about what it meant to dress in this seemingly conservative way why does a woman do this what kind of person is is um\n[noise] it took some years of encountering women like this to for me to realize you know just what a a kind of mischaracterization I was engaged and so you know when once my my wife's friend came over to our house and this woman is walking up the driveway dressed in blackface was covered I was walking straight towards me and\nI was thinking you know who is this person do flips off the hood and it's this friend of my wife was a TV actress and so I said oh you you know coming from us and she goes no no um it's just that you know I Can't go grocery shopping anymore without being more by people so now I put this thing on and I'm totally anonymous [noise] um [noise]\nAnd ah and on the one hand it speaks to you know something quite but now that ... you know so that this is the stars version of the hoodie and the sun glasses on the other hand it does speak to\n'em something about the gays and how the gaze of mothers doesn't diminish our freedom in a sense um and how this was this one woman's reaction in a particular context to that situation alternatively um you know there's a woman who uh my my daughter was studying computer coding with\n[noise] and um and she came to the house and uh\nUh and she was a a cousin of mine a woman who runs and a AI a tech company I'm sort of interview the student and said oh it's she's the woman she's the one I think should teach your daughter but\nI assume cheated on the phone because someone came and her face was covered her head was covered and I thought I was a bit surprised um Saddam in my daughter's influences in for her first computer\nCode in class and my daughter's wearing the pink two two and a sort of tank top and sits down next to this teacher um and it turns out that my daughter adores this teacher the teacher is incredible ... and as I get to know this woman it turns out that this woman is you know\nA PHD student that you'd tutors on the side she supports not just herself but her sister's for elderly parents I'm putting myself through this you know this doctorate and I mean she's just completely heroic a trailblazing you know a female figure and and so in many ways not idea was something that I had to learn\nAnd um that ah when the woman with something out of our own choice\nIt means what she intends to me and whatever we\nThose who are outside imagined it to me that's just the way magic and so and so what does it mean for the end this mobile it's a bit ambiguous and um but I've met enough people now to recognize that ah it can sort of mean really anything yeah\nHe began and you ended that onset by talking about ambiguity and Peter stay really with the reluctance ...\nCan sort of mean really anything yeah\nAnd he began and you ended that onset by talking about ambiguity and\nPeter stay really with the reluctant fundamentalist you're talking about I'm suddenly in that sense which essentially have to do with protection and\nPreconception and all the things we forced on what we don't understand whether it's the I Will will will mess and there's so many scenes in the book of tough guy said the book with you know moving into the age of Seventeen and when I put it down I thought this is a really melancholy book\nAs I've heard you talk about the future and what you were just saying the two hundred years from now this will seem in that balance moments 'cause the world is moving in a positive direction I hear you speak for a lot of sense\nHow do you see the future will you divide and\nI think that the future contains both um and it contains book and this is this is the sort of the duality of the future of the the the the future is um it is both\nFor each of us as individuals we will be extinguished we will cease to exist um the future contains tragedy at the level of the individual\nBut yet it also contains rebirth and hope and optimism and beauty and its balancing those two things ride um how do we um uh and and and in a sense one of the great failings and I think you know contemporary culture is all over the place\nIs I'm so much of our culture had been addressed to this question of you know\nThe fact that the self ends that to be a human being is to lose everything\nWe lose our childhood we lose our friends we lose our parents we lose our lover we lose life and yet it is possible despite this predicament to live a life that has so much beauty and so much connection and so much affection so much hope tenderness how do we do that\nNow [noise] um what I think is occurred is that we have seen uh the victory you could say in cultural terms of of a kind of capitalist impulse which tells us that that self interest is a fundamental motivation of humanity and should be celebrated and should be elevated to the prime a\nPosition now self interest is very useful it creates well if it is it is a productive thing it certainly is part of what can you know motivated a successful society but if we root our value system entirely on self interest we are\nIncredibly exposed to the predicament that the self and I'm a society built entirely on self interest is outside the unbelievably terrified\nOf the ending of the self um and uh and and vulnerable to all kinds of promotions\nAnd so as a market basically cells into our anxieties because it's the markets not interested in having us less be less invested in the south um and where so much of religion in the contemporary world is is deploying itself as a tribal affiliations system about group political dynamics as opposed to the individual\nOr shared human a spiritual predicament um what kind of in this limbo\nAnd so what what occurs is a profound sense of depression you know that that humanity right now I think is engaged in a in a kind of\nDeep state of psychological depression and we see the manifestations of this everywhere so when a young child in Pakistan goes into a shopping mall with bombs strapped to their body and blow themselves up um and kills twenty or thirty strangers\nAnd imagines that this could conceivably be considered a good death\nAnd when a young child in America goes into a school and shoots dead thirty of them for years and then kill themselves and imagine that this could be a good death um we have as a society utterly failed\nThe ... and then kill themselves and imagine that this could be a good death um we have as a society utterly failed in addressing the question of what does constitute a good death\nWe used to have ideas about this but now it seems to be that we are are so unwilling to engage I'm In this topic that we are you know a more D and so I think it's worth looking across you know all of our\nCollective wisdom as human beings all the stuff that we have known to figure out you know what do we do about this and\nAnd the truth is that there are things um that out of the melancholy of dusk there has always been a there always be an antidote I'm so for example you know you could imagine a kind of I'm a Buddhist or humans and approach which would say that if one\nOf roots ones presence in the in this moment fully a and is aware and present in this moment\nThe pasta begins to recede the futures revealed as a kind of illusion I'm at the moment expands to such a degree that are ... of the future moment diminishes\nOr you could say that if you look at for example the ah the suit the tradition of of a comic mysticism love based mysticism or the equivalent you know Jewish a tradition of somebody like Martin ... and his eyes out\nA love based relational mysticism or similar positions in so many other places but those things tell us is\nIf we love in the right way and strongly enough\nWe transcend the self and the fact that the self ends is less terrible and\nUm and what does this mean right this is all sort of highfalutin stuff but like I I've come to understand as I moved to Pakistan or my father for example is lost his brother recently lost his best friend recently um and yet he speaks of the future and he says oh you know well are we going to get this by\nA pass sorted out so that would be knocking budget bicycle or you know we'd have to build this tree house because the kids are getting old enough to he's excited about these things in the future why\nBecause his love for his grandchildren has altered his ... his relationship to time\nTheir future is something that excites\nAnd each of us has the potential to have a kind of love which is not a possessive love and you know not the love of a I Love you so you are my wife or I own you but ah the non possessive form of love which is not I love you because you make me less normally but\nI Love you which means I Want you to be less known to be\nBecause we can experienced is that too is an end to do and there's so many others and so I think for me what's interesting is now to engage in the human conversation and we said look let's take this stuff\nThat's taken out of its specific religious non religious ethnic whatever traditions let's find a book that everybody can participate in and let's begin to speak of it because it's not speaking of it has led us into horrific state of of of crisis Mm [noise]\n\nThen the age of global conversation I've always found it a point of hopes that who me the Islamic mystic has been the best selling pilots in America have a twenty five years in translation and sometimes misunderstanding but I'm Still the sense\nThat even as ... wolf couch and individually Web ... able to learn from one another metaphor went wider in our interests and the passions\nWhen you talk about your father I'm a minded as I understand it and he came to just studying California and I'm guessing that your parents in a way like my parents can hear 'em", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "city": "Dalhart", "day": "03"}
