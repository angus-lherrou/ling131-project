I I'm\nAn ... or is that\nRight well tell us about the American chestnut I you know a lot of our listeners have heard that name before but that may not be familiar with with things about the tree and then the blight also that affected the\nTerror I'm American chestnut as you mentioned a minute ago it was it was the dominant in the eastern shore is some people\nEven call it red would look to the east right now it was the orange trees that group to over a hundred and eighty oh there are all the diameter of\nThey were a major source of a former or\nShelter and ... and ... these days there was called the\nCradle to grave trade those people would you know everything from cradle to catch people were very the rise and fall and be able to get our age though it was very important for the region a not for very Borden\nPeople he's on turn on their own without any of the woods in all the them that's not you know\nI'm In the marrow commercial by making it other than that ... or ... ... and also the\nActivism is among the end of the cities is Val I'm right\nI'm Mr motion and most of our listeners or you know are probably just when I think about just sort of thinking about the Chinese chestnut that they that they've seen everything planet or a lot of homeowners and wildlife and through just you know plan to Chinese chess match explain candidate different genetic though Chinese or a whole lot smaller but just just kind of give a difference in those trees\nOkay the the Chinese tree is around ...\n... but smaller was trading in\nTerms of the shade and it's really been bred for commercial him for the for ... for a city I mean it is still a lot of lot of\nUm overturned by betting on American lives a little while tree is baller\nStranger on\nWas it was um\nMore more prevalent than while sitting right and\nYeah it's it's always been fascinating to me to see the old the old photographs of out of a you know I Love the\nThe Appalachian south and I've got to get we got a cabin up close to ... my wife and I didn't spend a lot of time and the ... national forest and\nAnd it really interesting I've seen some old pictures around there of the of the trees it I guess in the spring when they would bloom and it looked like snow fall you know owned by some of the hillsides they're really amazing\nIt is really quite ... um and that that was it good script and I've seen those descriptions to [laughter] but you know almost like Ninety\nIt as why it just we can't gain perspective for had ... which is really amazing well and\nThat's I I have heard it said that one out of every four one out of every five trees and the Appalachian Mountains was a un American chestnut so I don't know if that's accurate or not but that's a lot and I I when I was in college I took an Appalachian ecology class in the ... and we went up and found places where chestnuts had been cut\nBig some of the stumps army that you can still get up on her organic perspective of how big the trees or and it's a ... you know it was a shame for sure to lose all of those trees in and tell us about the ... described the blight to us\nOr the blind leading just accidentally through\nSome ... slums that were brought into the country a first appeared in New York so logical part which is now now that's the problem but in Nineteen oh surely the curator of the limited to a lot of his ... the trees were\nDying or some kind of disease which he didn't recognize the video but it's been a couple of years almost always treaties and\nAnd the park has died ... and um it was accidentally introduced from Asia probably some plants that were brought over here in China and Japan by my current thinking is there any from Japan\nBut it's springtime for clinical 'em down into the deep South Korea rate of about fifty miles a year while until in the forties and fifties it hits the deepest part of the ...\nAnd killed all electricity back on\n... wow well I I haven't heard a that in two thousand five or two thousand six somewhere and there are there were one or more trees found in the Talladega ranger district of the Talladega national forest is is that right\nThat's correct and there was a large tree sounded in two thousand trial a forest technician people's mark and also an area of ... and one of them happened to see some chest not burgers during a media he recognized slipping were meant back when you are in\nAnd then what you want to do you weren't allowed to about six or eight weeks or so just letting letting those chemicals are absorbing the root system um and really get a good kill\nA owned the vegetation has grown up since the timber was harvest a horse that\nUm and then after that typically in October November maybe early December\nUm is typically when you burn burn off all of that debris ball that slash those towels tops and um and have a good fire that will that will carry 'em through the property and it's important to ah if I might\nDo you want to spray you want to have a good span of natural vegetation coming back you want this week downs to come by those those briar patch in those kinds of things you won't those to come back that way when you spray you get a good bang for your book when you spray and not ... third right yeah so as far as planning\nA once you spray you burn it typically December January maybe\nBurst of February somewhere in that time\nI'm as what you do your tree planting and um he want to have to get it done as soon as as soon as you can December January and then\nAh just ah hopefully have a good wet spring that way those literally a new root systems and started Gil established right um during the doormen say\nYeah and all you're trying to do is to give those are new seedlings the best chance they can to out compete all the other stuff that's naturally going to grow and then hope that their water to and so I mean that's in that essentially what you're trying to do\nIt is you want to give them the best chance of survival and have the highest you are when you put those trees in the ground and I'm just trying to do everything you know as soon as you can put a good uh early spring rain from Mother Nature\nAnd um and it went blah blah we typically can essentially just kind of walk away from it for\nTen twelve fourteen years yeah a long way to a little different you know with fire regimens and everything but um ... which is what you see a lot and the south south the planet I'm typically once you do that you're you're good to go for a while\nOh yeah how you folks to if you if you've got some timber and the last year to\n'em or you need to strongly consider you know spending this money and replaying your property you know ... we we we don't have time to get into the to the yield curve mature you know if you just look at the numbers of which are you going to be with with a\nA property that's it's been replaying it and managed in in sight brampton chemically treated and burn you yield over long haul was going to be way way way way higher maybe two to three times as high as it just to just an actress Pam Brown real quick before we get off the air\nYeah you were really sharing a compelling story with me about you know about helping helping somebody with a timber sales manager and tell us about that\nYeah I was reaching out to have reached out to a client or you have reached out to me and I'm\nSomeone looking to do something with their property and um you know from selling that didn't know if I wanted to sell it or cut the timber\nAnd a lot of talk this gentleman for a a couple of months and uh right now he's decided who wants to do something with the number of its own this property and um it's roughly the but the temperature is roughly about a hundred acres and I'm told me that a hit\nOr decided to go ahead and have it could and I had a lot of hard with a ... a hard one\nFolks and um some of the price of the he was offered a on a per unit a sale and he's won the clear cut everything in order to ... per unit type so and ah he was telling me some of the prices that he was offered and\nI told him that they were alone a friday as good as hardwood is you know right now and everything and you know and then one case it was you know over half of what kind of what's going on right now and I lost a lot of ... oh yeah and I'm a model especially when you have a hard ... know this time of year you know on a\nHundred hundred acres and um and and talking with them you know he told me so I so I'm Glad I come across you um you know for shooting history and telling me\nKind of want to look for you stood on\nA set up I'm Glad I didn't accept the national offer and I told them to different ways that you do a timber sales you know ... or a lump sum and and I told him I stayed with a clear cut and you know a lump sum as a\n... in his situation is was the best way to go and uh it really made me feel good to be able to help someone in that situation who\nMay not have gotten paid for everything and ... with the proper ... the trees were worth right and um and that's what we do they know southeastern land grant myself than Jesse Thompson\nUm where you can help our our guys are are you just throw the company either clients out some properties are looking to do something on the ... will be glad to take a look at it and that's just one example but we've helped people along the way\nAnd um and

of the things that you're seeing a in in the agricultural sector right now\nAnd I there's just a lot out there to be\nCautiously optimistic about ah you know with the the new trade agree\nBig agriculture organization but they're getting the word is cautiously often based\nUh you know they like what they're seeing so far ... has so many things to the end is for the ...\nYeah and uh you know we don't know how some of the things that don't work out but but everyone feels good about it\nAnd as so often is with the economy perception is reality yeah uh actually we if we really go back in just looked at things you want the white people playing and and how they're feeling\nHas as much to do with how our economic ill as anything else a world and\nYou know as far as our farm sector or the people that are drivers they are they're they're pretty much in favor of curl up in his policy and you know we might have heart worm here in their own different thing but it is as a general rule\nUh everyone is on board with those policies ... percent can is good\nI'm One of the things that I Would kind of point to the fact that ... ... ... for a month of all time record dollars more head a in two thousand I think and who the hell of a thing or\nA ... there's some things that are really pushing the economy that way\nOr that I don't think I'll eat I don't think I needed T bone in August so

kind of at the macro level that\nAre kind of cashing in on some of the more reason to gain the plane in that market and some of them are a little apprehensive about what the two to three a year outlook might be in that market their their sales and now\nWe've got farmers that are kind of planning to ramp up production Saddam\nAnd uh so therefore they're they're getting in that market but we're also seeing pressure from other sectors of the economy on some of our\nTraditional ag land you know it is coming back at this point in time just because of economic they were building right
