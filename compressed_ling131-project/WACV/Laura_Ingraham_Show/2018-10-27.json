good well hey listen I Want an update on the ... tree on the ... you and\nA Robert King and and John horn and some of our other team are over there all of our Georgia folks were over there for the uh ... and I got to hear how it was a man I was so excited to get that report friendship boy lock and few weeks ago and to hear that they were actually going to get to do it after the hurricane I just I I've been waiting to get a report from yeah\nYeah well we uh we had a great weight they are the ... you know I'm\nA we saw a lot of damage coming into the to the expo grounds there I'll ride around the ... or was it was rather\n... you know leaves down that kind of play a little bit of power outage around ...\nBut um we had a good show there are there was a lot of people that come through I think the crowd was all a little bit about ... people went on strike local twenty thirty mile radius of Moultrie they're probably had better things to do and yeah and it's a little lower for that reason um\nBut we still we talked with people from Virginia a the Carolinas ... people\nUm and are actually talked to a guy from Texas\nA M and we still have the international registry we saw a lot of people from all over the world that come through and that's pretty typical that we see that uh there at that exposed so yeah it was a it was a good week uh I enjoy the time they are the weather\nWas a little bit warm the first two days and we had a ... coup morning on the last day on Thursday and I'm a you know just to\nYou know as as usual we come away with some contacts and and so I'm a maintenance and people on top of the ... that I think it would be beneficial bigger\nYeah absolutely well I Know our thoughts and prayers are still go out to all the folks in southeast Alabama south Georgia and then\nUh Florida just received a lot of damage from Michael and we had air and basically uh with the Alabama Kalamazoo association on last week Randall and she was talking about\nA lot of our cattle producers in the south part of the state are still recovering one she she mentioned one former specifically that had about thirty miles of fence down just around his one form\nThat that are out there there is a good bit of\nA that kind of damage around especially used in ... I'm probably Geneva county there in Alabama but a study in that kind of damage in in a lot of times you might draft urban area after a storm and and you look at the buildings that may or may be\nYou know a roof shingles blown off for some mental blown off and he was like well the building and sustained\nLimbs ah they fall a lot easier and it doesn't take a lot of wind about some lambs down and get on fences right when you've got five hundred acres is spent on that happens you know a thousand times that takes a long time to go through there and it was apparently it\nYeah and it doesn't take long for the cows to find the how does it\nExactly exactly especially this time of year when you know for just starting to get a little slimmer on the ground right I just don't want to get to the fall months a year\nAnd so those cows are are there out searching and looking and you can buy at the first place they're going to go it started down tree a space that has leaves on it right ... leaves next thing you know what they said to hell with the fence and they had to go\nI didn't grow up around cows I I've spent you know a little bit of time round and but one of the things it's always amazing to me that the the most Warren ground is usually right there\nThere is any way for them to get out those rascals are going to be out on\nThe ... that's right I mean I can tell you from experience for and what would be the\nUm the phone calls that I get\nA PR cattle out or when I'm going\nTo make sure I can leave town and I met with Anna that happen on cattle out there trying to round up somebody go put cows that for me\nBut when they're watching your Facebook page cows and watching your Facebook page to know where you are and you know because I Will read so\nBut ah yeah and and that's that's the devastation I mean when you've got cattle and you can't get paying them\nUm and they're either in somebody else's pasture or they're into my crop field um you know the guy that's got peanut Cher caught you know the ... next to you you don't want those cattle out there in in their crops right uh they're they're battling enough as it is just to get everything the so\nThat's a huge thing um one thing I saw that will really disturbing to me\nGoing through a that southwest Georgia area was the pecan orchard yeah I'm just just looking at those uh we saw some you know a lot of trees down but almost every tree handling of ... right and just to clean up from my aunt and they were you know they're just a few weeks away from harvesting those time so I'm I'm sure a lot of\nThe ... and I don't know if I can be harsh or not but there's a lot of the huge task player in\nThose pecan trees I mean you can plant one today in your seven or eight years yeah they start in production\nYeah that's that's almost generational destruction when something like that happening to become greedy and\nIt is and it was you know there there was a lot of ... county ... called ... and there's a lot of new call on a\n... so there's some new stock\nAnd even those trees were laid over a you know they were they were a point and all of them wanted to ration mayor and uh so hopefully those can be straightened back up and be okay but you know you can just see that as long term damage yeah cotton crops you could see the uh the cotton and been stripped out of the bowls are a lot on the ground\nThere's lot still in the plant but it it was not in a bowl form and right wing harder pay 'em\nAnd phone I'm sure that a lot ladders aloft crawl up our our big metal in their body and say it it was going to be a bumper crop issue you're\nIn a lot of farmers were on a get out of bed and have you know half mainstream cup issue\nYou know random we were um ... meeting a last week in Montgomery and job and building bagging industries cheap for the state talked about the damage in Georgia being used in Alabama it's in the millions\nHundreds of millions but in George aged into billions and um I think we're probably going to find out Florida will be the same so which is a truly astronomical damage into\nTrap you know own a a poultry farms are I Know in Alabama I talked to a guy yesterday following that we sold the actually this year\nI'm In Houston and he had some damage there nothing major\nFarm down the road um that I've been on before\nA lost the roof off of a a pull that house layer and I'm I'm hopefully like the repair that they had birds they are so ... it all I Know there were some damage to poultry houses in Alabama Georgia the last I heard was about Ninety two houses damaged or destroyed wow um and so there's a pretty significant number there\nYou know the net southwestern corner so you know if there's poker houses damaged there's all kind of other ANC a\nTap building sugar or grain elevators pay the elevators shops and she is the whole nine yards wow um and uh I spoke to another guy or earlier this week that I'm Out of the Mariana Florida area a past and stuff and and southeast Alabama there too but they're being\nIn that area and and they had major structure damages their farm near Mariana there by ... begins were toppled over they were atheist or they didn't have anything in there to hold them\nA lot of farm sheds a structure or are gone and had a lot of equipment that was total advantage because buildings fell on ... or you know other other kind of damage right well there are struggling\nYeah there are a lot of folks down that way that NATO or thoughts and prayers and help as we can give it in a rental I Know you're burning up the road headed to to show some ... houses today will cause some farms if somebody wants to reach out to eat or about ... on a farm or poetry form how do they do that\nYeah just give me in a column I cell phone numbers to five states to breed nine five three seven that\nThat's right or you can reach Randall up terse the southeastern land group office at eight six six seven five one land Randall thanks for being on the show today brother and the blessings in your travels like Johnny\n... Dave I'm excited right now we're gonna leave clay County Alabama we're going to go down to Tallahassee, Florida we don't uh don't often covered that part uh in our topics on the land so here but we've got one of our own then you're automatically there who's going to give us a timberland report from Tallahassee a Daniel how are you this morning buddy\nGood Jonathan how're you doing\nI'm doing well man do ... I was glad to hear ah for for our listeners that that may not know 'cause I don't hear you weekly um year one of our southeastern group agents you live there in Tallahassee, Florida and had to evacuate for hurricane Michael and I'm Glad to hear that you you came home and and your things were were relatively okay\nYeah I'm yeah I'm Tallahassee itself had a fair amount of trees down in um had some power outages but we were on the far east side of that hurricane and um and were spared um for the most part and you know all points with I'm definitely got a lot worse than we did\nYeah and I know part of your family business or the or for one of the other things you do in addition to being a an agent with southeast Joanna group is you help folks uh your your family company their maintenance timberland and ah and timber assets and what have you been seeing a post hurricane\nOur only true trout waters in Alabama with a cold water coming off you know Smith leg down they\nAnd their rainbow trout the hatchery and and probably you know we've got blistered Oliver Alabama radio stations all over Alabama moral and the you know the Internet and everything and probably have some list or that don't even know we have trout and Alabama so\nJust tell us a little bit about you know about the tale race there you know maybe the history of our trout got there and then tell us about your business and how you get started\nSo ah when they built the dam and sixty two they started operations as a Smith like bam\nAnd ... impounded such deep water to a Smith lake is is a really deep lake\nAnd I think the original idea was let's put them on trial and the lake and the what happens you know to give people a different layer of the lake to fish though you know brand bad weather or warm water species are going to stay up near the top\nBut if we put some you know some trout in there that will go deeper and that'll give people more water to fish and after a couple of years they realized nobody in Alabama I knew how to fish sixty\nFeet in the ... [laughter]\nAnd I was surprised surprise um but uh some of them were coming through the dam and getting into the river system\nAnd so they were targeting the trial and the river and they found guys down there I'm I'm sure most of them fly fishermen who uh who thought hey there's document leg maybe there'll be on the river\nAnd uh and they were really targeting them and doing pretty well and so they changed over and said well we'll we'll stop talking the lake\nStart docking or the rivers and I think that happened in the seventies and er and since then you know they they started talking I think probably once a year that twice a year that every other month and now we get stocked with rainbow trout every single month helped 'em it's helped our cat trade it's helped\nPeople have more access to 'em and stuff like that\nWell are are the fish able and reproduced or do the travel in long enough to reproduce there\nThey wouldn't live long enough or the the hatchery from which they dock our fish are supposed to be Darryl fish um even if they weren't but cost the hydro electric than\nIt rises and falls in pretty significant fashion and row and uh yeah that that flow would not allow them to uh to make a good read and uh NBA also raised\nA offspring and in that part of the river um and it could be that if conditions were right they could go up some of them are creeks and uh and spawn but we haven't we haven't documented any of that taking place on the\nRight one of the cool things just about where I live in Perry county as we have a fish hatchery in the town of Marion\nAnd they raise a lot of the fish that we swapped for tendency for their uh for their trial we send our spot I mean a ... center mass and that sort of stuff up there so it was kinda cool uh than our little town having a part in that but it it is how far down river from the damn will you find these drought\nSo I've got a picture of a guy\nSo in a town in his hand down at Copeland ferry bridge which is probably\nI Would guess forty miles\nDown to Chinatown wow wow who I wouldn't have yeah when I had some ...\nSo where are you doing it gorgeous gorgeous is the kind of the cut off rise or when they're operating edits putting way too hot of a water back in ... um for the route to go down and that's only in the wintertime\nSo now you know as temperatures start to fall as the water temperature starts to drop back down this time is it hitting the water for his long I'm a stamp starts to drop and they'll start those are migrating go start maybe they'll do look for food look for a better place to the ... and eat and uh and they'll they'll just keep going until they found the right spot\nNow one of the most iconic scenes to me in Alabama as you're driving through is when you drive across the river right they're below the damn early in the morning and ah and water temp is cooler than the air to him when you you get all that same your eyes off the water that's really cool there and their brand\nIt is that bridge is probably a hundred at least a hundred feet above the water yeah and there are times that you're driving across the bridge and that bag is above you [laughter] well above the rivers down that low and the fog is coming up a hundred feet yeah over a\nI'm a fan and that is really cool\nIt is you know right on the surface there's usually a clear spot\nAnd so are you guys you know you can see what you're doing the right or what's around you but then you kind of kind of take a break and look up and all you see is that that man is moving ... or across the face the trees and over the surface of the water it's uh it's pretty amazing\nWhat brand and I know this is a real family affair or you know your wife Mary Carol in your in your father Randy you know ... and he helps run the shop and ah you beautiful children there and you know you just tell us about your business how at runs the services you all for\nThe type of God's servers you all for in a little bit about the flush out\nSo we offer um guided trips we do waiting trips where we use furnish everything\nUm we've got waiters in boots and all sizes and so there's ... people just show up at the shop where you get 'em geared up they come out and stand side by side or either four or eight hours the other half day trip for a full day trip and talk about the river about\nAbout trout about how they function and operate and try to get you\nYou know the the right casting in the right or ability to read the water in order to have the best\nAnd catching fish and that's you know pretty heavy on instruction and where we spend a lot of time working with you and helping you be more successful would fly fishing\nWe also offer a thrift boat trip\nAnd uh I have a boat trip Andrew boat common added post and it's made in Montana\nAnd it's a it's designed by two guys that really worked at it and and made it basically\nThe perfect fly fishing boat and uh it's just convenient it is a it's comfortable it's super stable and so we can go out and that and we get to cover a lot more water we traveled on\nUm we we have good extent catching fish but it's it's more of a relaxed or if it's got it's got pedestal steeped in it so why is that if you want you can just kinda sit down and relax\nAnd uh it's just a a great way to enjoy the day I'm spending targeting the trout and talk and and and\nDown river that many how many feet on the boat their brand\n[noise] uh and I can do as as many as a ten on a waiting trip but we we divide that out by depending on ability and uh and number a guide\nThose those drift boats are fun I've never done it in Alabama but we my wife and I did it in Wyoming and it's just it is a relaxing in a beautiful way to to get that how how much water can you cover in one of those joke but it's I'm sure it varies by current but how much water do you fish in a day\nOr and a half ago\nAnd a half day will typically do about two to three miles a night I'm older down and then come back out\nIn a while yeah that kind of awesome man ... and it's such a such a great trip so you said you you're talking about kids in five pound rainbows um I mean how you know ... is that as big as I get\nThat's a trophy fish now for our water for sure\nUm I didn't know there are um recorded instances of people catching fish up to running around the eight eight and a half boundary oh wow on this subject for the\nYeah the closures record in it it was just I record Alabama states\n... I think that an ad okay oh wow yeah\nSo and I know yeah that's all catch and release are you able I'm assuming since I don't reproduce you can take them\nTo get to this state rag is a ... fish and know Colleen so if you catch and release chicken chicken fish all day\nOr if you catch a fish and you made it as part of your ... that you're going to take it home in any way if you put it on a string or even a puddle on the side of the river or in a bucket or not is one of your five fish for the day ... and uh and so we do all catching or at least with our church just because\nIt's too much work sure it it just changes the changes the focus on that trip\nWhen we got to keep them alive or I'm assuming you're family likes to eat out I mean I I that would be my I guess\nWe are so ... so we had it it's kinda like the guy a ball when I was younger I raise cheap for for eight\nOr ... or [laughter] you know they're they're kind of your pet to kind of it or not I have is a\nKind of hard I get when you were you really want our class to catch fish yeah you really we I mean I Know I've been on many trip with clients where I Am way more anxious about them catch that dry are worried about it\nAlways ... guide to feel that way [laughter]\nIf I take a if I take a fish out the back strip all of this running through my head and you know they could have contact with it so that yeah we we don't really pay you know if we have one that's", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Coosada", "day": "27"}
