today it's it's getting to be a big time of the year for you and your industry you're a bow hunting and and a bone manufacture\nA and and call tell us a little bit about yourself and then we'll we'll talk about new breed archery\nMy name's Carl null and uh like I said I'm a native Alabamians afternoon ground a little bit but I always make home here in Alabama I grew up in uh near demolished Alabama or ... county ... county that area is a great and Iran yeah a grip on a small farms\nAnd a lot ... than we thought well that's definitely increased by hunting again bit and then a from their uh I got out work or a a small company that had moved to Alabama and got a ... who\nBecame an engineer sort of got out of the archery died I mean as far as engineering I'll\nStill stay in archery tournaments shooting or that it's kind of thing but it wasn't going to work in archery and then uh for some reason my passion drove me back into it and now his couldn't leave it alone always\nTrying to build a better mouse trap and that sort of where I got started and then that's how I Need a break and when ... was really trying to build the the best of myself and just turned out that everybody else ... hey [laughter] good\nWell you know I I was a ... a month for my brother and brother in law this past weekend and both of them are big bow hunters and they and they were talking I was telling them you're going to be on the show and both of them were talking about what a great product you make and we my family I have a shot in several years but we used to ... we've been shooting for twenty five years\nOr and they just had really positive things to say about your bows and I I guess before we talk about your product somebody who introduced you to bow hunting how did you get involved with that\nWell like I mentioned I I grew up on a farm just outside of the ... so it's pretty easy arm life a little bit um I think is the catch ... which is called it live and back and anyway um\nThey're all a at a young age out\nI was the kids that got the you know go out after Dan and killed something and then leave pretty well I'm kind of feel dress David right there you know and you know bring it home my mom was making breakfast while we were finishing up the beer and now we butchered her own and then\nHe had a boat on the wall or carbon than I wanted to play with that thing all the time and kept telling me as too much for you you know so um as I got a little a little older I kept nagging him in I think he figured it out a little\nBit now is getting you know of course that teenage Asian he was saying you know I got to do something to keep them grounded [laughter] yeah I mean a boat and got very urban and starting to teach me how to do on a little bit now I'll be honest we probably did not do we were doing\nOr should we be a little bit of age range I'm forty five so you know going back in the eighties off yeah anyway well you know when we were doing but\nWe got out there and he he was determined to ah to get in there I mean believe it or not that the first Iraq deal with a boat actually feel the same way you would if you were on a a a man job or a shotgun on you know a fifth of the woods and push one bombing and I got lucky in the same stuff for me to get a shot at it but I don't know\nOf that as long as I was standing at fourteen out well I think I'll start the airport they run around their house it was coming from that point or\nHas been a major part of my life I now hunting and generally is there some reason it's my passion\nSure and you know you travel all over I I've seen some videos tell us a bit of a I mean do you go all over the country by hunting or maybe all over the world\nWell I've been out out of the country as well but uh I travel exhibit in in a in the United States I've been to Colorado several times I've been to Idaho\nOr several times but I like the west I have to say that if if you're a you're in eastern guy eastern guy that into a bow hunting for some reason you're drawn to the west is something about that allure spot south can I ask some opportunities so uh\nAnd or just be able to do what they do with a better a Linder is focused on what their\nWhat their processes and with our patronage programming and everything being able to give us some money back at the end of the year when we get done and\nAnd lower that affect the cost of borrowing money you know it's just a really great to be a part of their team and and so you know he's gone figures running and and the combine drowning and right now it's just a it's a fun time of the year for us because\nThey're they're evil we're starting to see those\nAll those uh investments come to fruition\nOne thing I I like about your team and you have offices spread all around the state\nAnd I know when I give somebody the name of one of the loan officers dire with Alabama had credit you are going to take good care of them and I get constant feedback from people saying hey\nDale Williams in Selma made it easy to work with ... you know made it easy to work with that sort of thing so I I mean you all do a fantastic job of making these ... easy and you guys hear Montgomery our top notch man their top not\nAn approach to Jonathan is any way I we take for a great pride in what we do because that separates us from everybody else you know because when you come and not only do we gonna treat you like\nAny by where we don't treat you like to any other customer but you're going to become a stockholder Ryan or if you're an owner you know in in then from there\nWe just build our relationship and and it's it's really easy to be able to to keep going on that a long way when we do meet that person and they bought a piece of property and then they want a tractor and they say you know will forever can we do a tractor and yeah we can do a tractor\nOr can we build a lake yeah let's build a Laker fan and they want to build a lodge and yeah absolutely list go build a large so we become that ah that Linder for everything that they want to do to to make the the\nYou know a lot of people just really want to be out there in that that gold diggers to have a place in the country under a tire or have a place where the family\nLast week we become part of the dream and yeah and it's really really beneficial for for us to cause this makes it fun I think the thing\nThe thing I Love about you about your organization you talking about being a being a shareholder is a you know your your your borrowers have a voice because not only the ... bar or ... but they're also part of your part of your company and so everybody is part of the team\nOr the patronage programs tremendous I had a guy called me of the day and he was complaining about rights going up a little bit as I look at you know back to patronage I'd explain it to him\nAnd you know you all but in that that one percent range you know sometimes a little less than a little bit more than that you know if you get a six and a half interest rate than the effective right maybe more closer to five and a half by the time you get you get you patronage back is tremendous Programme and folks always have a voice because they're part of the family explained that\nThat's right and you know every ... every loan a requirement is a year you become a a stockholder and you have a voice in in college and the board of directors\nAnd if there's a concern that you have you have direct lines to either your lender the branch manager the a senior lender\nAll the way up the line and and all that you you can get directly to those folks so you know anytime they say anything comes up we can we can focus on a need and make sure that we're handling anything that uh is is is needed\nWe eat like I say you guys do a fantastic job and if somebody wants to reach out to you how can they get information about Alabama I cut it in general and then here specifically Montgomery\nOn a a in general best place to go though my my credit dot com we've got a great website will on information about our programs and what we can do\nAnd here in Montgomery or direct line to the offices three three four two seven zero eight six six and even if you may be in another county with the right to call the way it needs to be to make sure we handle any requests to\nBoy I'll do a fantastic job but we've we've had Travis Jordan on here and I joke he's the bulldog man if he if he gets a chance that alone he's going to do everything he can to make that thing going on before before we get off your I get a real important question now did you use up all your relatives will appeal malfunctioned landed on\nYour way and I think we need to lose weight you could you could make good for you in on the phone maybe a quarter of a quarter\nOf a no ... is is is to the was soon and I know they've got a lot of challenges up there and and those guys have got his you know we we will see them coming together yeah and uh you know it's uh believe me I Know those are being in that position\nThey're not on their ... they really want things that we work in a boat and then they're working out and it's going to come to get that one goes five guys almost once they figure out what the guy next to them doing all the time they were going to start seeing a lot\nOf what they're doing a great job in\n... I I think we just gotta\nIf bin is a great but we'll keep this thing going for a while and we're not going anywhere here will obey Nelly Alabama and credit thank you so much for being a sponsor and thank you for being annoying show today\n... uh enjoy that interview with men and we're going to leave the studio now we're going to go over a little north east of here I guess I'm Clay County Alabama\nTurned to our good friend Randall a church Randall how are you today\nUm beer that how are you a\nGood buddy or listen I this is crunch time for you you all have a a big cattle sell on your farm today don't you\nKnow ... hours away from the fifth annual at church and gets a boom the email so he'll be today at noon and we've had in mind is listening this morning that are still some good cattle or come they don't cattle or come on the line would be glad hand\nRandall nice Kobe real strange now having a cow sale there and the wedding bar [laughter]\n... thoughts I had a wedding in may and you are what are you doing running Keanu waiting menu\nYeah yeah the waiting on the lawns in mind when [laughter] I ...

I got to confess I didn't grow up around cows I don't know a whole lot about it but I I've been to one cattle cell in my life and the one thing that I I can say is true I think about a lot of these advances you always going to have good food there\nWhere we are we are we've got a a local guy that there's a a good barbecue they don't have British get ready and so\nUm it is the age where there's something that the taste and smell and the rainy here and just you our so\nI'm just don't truly among open\nWhile we might we might just do that well listen you know this is the third anniversary of the show you you been a great contributor for our farmland report and I will just kind of want to put you on the spot with a couple of questions here how many miles do you think you've driven now as soon as this show started here and I know\n[laughter] I I think I average of twenty or thirty and forty five thousand a year mark ... um you could play a hundred and twenty thousand\nHas kind of what I was thinking around for myself as well and then this one that this may be about the same numbers how many miles how many barbecue restaurants you know and it's just\nA few traveled three to four days a week and I'm a late lunch three or four days a week so you probably because they haven't had a lot\nAre certainly a kind of sewer and uh and and your Argo two for one way that when we need a recommendation on where to eat well tell us about the catalyst that what is the charge brothers so why ... what can people expect today\nWhen we got um a good set of goals be alone nearly nine to ... day I'm here are tested BSO you tested there needed to go work for you and or anything we can't even ... bowls at the growth and power bowls so you need something to breed\nFirst and your first two will have those um middle ... slick the females are there ... all those or Richard animals come open have pushed to fall painters or donors that we've done an embryo transfer and also ... the soil\nWe've got a little cross section of the Harvard or Yale layer\nBut uh back to the bulls you know a ...\nEverybody has a commercial ... operation their paycheck is based off of the bowl but they've got out there right and we always encourage people to you know investment until a bullet pitcher or move on to the issue of budget but don't make your budget so small that you don't get genetics you have the right\nMove my control would be an ocean of your income on account of her for the next ... years and so a small investment to Berlin by half big returns which down down the line there and we've ... we've got some good genetic that that will work pretty\nWell it's interesting and again I'm not on a negotiated when it comes to cattle sales but how you have the ability to sell cows embryos and then people partner up to to buy an interest in some of these ... and and cows that you're selling off to\nThe last ... for a federal lease scale that we have we my partner somebody else in a weird thing and then we go out and we'll be back in the ... that are beyond ... and we may Allen only on the percentage of that ball or that you might also\nNon ... a good bit special the embryo transfer today you can get multiple names out of one gallon in that year and a expand on her own genetic buddies are more easily than get bitten by\nOkay well I Know you've also been busy once you put the sale behind you know you'll be you'll be glad to get back on the road helping folks it seems like poultry farms are still moving pretty ... pretty briskly right now", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Coosada", "day": "06"}
