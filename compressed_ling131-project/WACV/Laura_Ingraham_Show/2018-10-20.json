Dave and John\nEverybody welcomed the Late Show with David ... is a beautiful Saturday morning here in Montgomery, Alabama\nHere with my co hosting good friend Johnny be good to be how you doing great brother good to be back in the studio with you may not be had a good week last week I didn't see much of an do you are running around looking at farmers are burned up by ... it's been a busy week man just exciting good time with family and\nA six sided we have an action packed show today for sure yeah let's just jump right into were were really excited we have a very special gifts were just very pleased to have\nA ... general ... Marshall in Studio with us a current general Marshall by ... thank you feel like we're bringing little sand mountain flavor to\nWork off and I graduated from I actually grew up in ... uh finished my last three years of high school at the Albert go I assume we are talking about some some mutual friends judge Floyd and you know we\nDo when they're on land and they give you a million dollar and bring it at our\nThirtieth high school reunion and that was that was really strange but ... I was glad we had some name tags goes ah [laughter] things have changed a little bit more changes including a lot of a ball weighs a been a guy for radio anyway so uh uh but it was good it was good to catch up with those guys they don't and I know that's what you\nCall it is home India my my daughter just got married in a married young firefighter there now one onto beautiful place and mountain has been terrific to me and you know we'll we'll go back there eventually that that's how\nI Know you've been on both sides are so you you actually grew up in South Alabama\nYeah you know I'm from at more originally a grenade he had to form a new ah you know I spend a lot of time in Iraq growing up in a new T Mobile when I was really young dad worked in sporting goods and they'd all over so I've got ... ... from South Alabama practice law both in Montgomery Birmingham part went to Marshall County so I feel like\nI've had a little bit of every bit of the state in me at some point in time and Alabama's home without even\nOr the desire was always come back to Alabama could album\nWas how it is it's a beautiful voice and we appreciate you how long have you been in office\nHas only it's going on twenty months ah was appointed back in February of two thousand Seventeen which seems like forever ago in many ways and a been a remarkable journey I'm a\nCareer prosecutors basically kind of where I come from and so you walk into the role you know people look at the age is on the top top and so very comfortable they are but what I think is the most exciting is the way that we had the opportunity eighties office\nTo impact issues outside of public safety you know summer I relate to you know to landowners and those who care about our environment in the state or and do it in a responsible way you know we've been engaged in issues and impact them as well sure\nAnd and one of the most pressing issues of white as the waters of the United states rule will tell us about that um when was the current member was the current status of the law\nKnow we saw clearly with uh the PA under the Obama administration would ah you know federal overreach is probably had limited term but you know it's funny a Justice Scalia one time talked about\nUh the fourth branch of government and that's when some of our federal agencies believe that they truly are much higher authority than than they really weren't in what we saw it was where the EPA is expansive definition of the waters of the U. S. so that we were limiting the use of land by landowners in in a proper way and\nSo we were involved in our office and being able to push back to say that he PA engaged in significant overreach in that area and we're re please that when\nYou know former a director Pruitt or was there that they rescinded that former Obama era rule and right now are trying to be more responsible but I mean like I'm a product of rural Alabama\nYou clearly have family that that has been involved in the timber and farming business for a long time those are conservationist I mean they care about the land they want to be responsible with the land\nAt the same time we don't need to be burdened by regulation from from the federal government and so when I think they will see is an opportunity for a responsible\nRuled come about it protects the waters of this country which we want to be able to do but also recognizes the ride of individuals to use their property and the inappropriate way and so I think it's going to be an opportunity for those that care about this issue to be able to submit comments\nA and they will come forward with a rule that makes a lot more sense for the only the people of Alabama but the people in this country sure who will actually issue that ruined and what do you think that the timeframe might be also a a met with a with the person ... managing budget recently that's responsible for sort of authorizing rules when they come out\nUh this is a significant issue in this country and so big deal now yeah\nAnd so I think that they will take their time and going forward with it you know the good thing is we suspended the other rule which was irresponsible and going back to what was at least a little better version but ah but I'm expecting some time over the next year that will see progress on that front but to the extent that anybody is listening to the show that cares\nYou know you do have the ability summit written comments to to propose rules and so\nThose are available out there for inspection if somebody needs to be able to find anything contact our office I'll be glad to sort of\nGive them that opportunity but ah we hope that folks will weigh in and that are really feel confident that the Obama administration will do some excuse me the Trump Administration will do something that's responsible because you know what we've seen from them it's in the limited time the President Trump has been in office\nThirty three regulations rescinded for every one that's been adopted by that's a very positive thing now some of that is low hanging fruit I don't think it'll continue at that rate but yet\nYou know when we see would a you know the federal register which compiles all of those government regulations you know basically being reduced by force or that shows that they are truly making a difference in that area but it but this is one of those rules that matter just like some other ones related critical habitat loss\nAnd that he is for responsible government uh you know something that is that in and we really believe in individual freedoms and individual rights and\nA lot of those things that the constitution guarantees we don't we don't need government making those decisions for us uh all the time and that's one of the things is I've read about your record I appreciate that are pretty said that we have\nA somebody this conservative this fighting for us for fighting for individual freedoms in law's not I think that's a that's a big help ah for land owners and it just for people in general for citizens in general it's nice to know that we've got somebody on our side is not ... not trying to tell us everything\nThey buy their best Caprio I think limited government is ... you know with the military defense will proudly guys are military I think we do law enforcement well knows that the public safety well sometimes on government gets involved in issues we screwed up more than we make it better it's why you\nKnow even this broader debate that we have going on right now are relating to social media and\nFacebook's in Google and Twitter is I think if there's a lot that are calling for federal regulation of those entities\nAnd again I think we have to be very careful what we do and what the federal government and the state government is involved with right needs to be within the lane clearly needs to be authorized by the constitution and then we need to make sure that we're being able to comply with the laws in a way that allow for people\n... sphere that as it allows for businesses to thrive and for individuals to exercise freedoms\nThat's exactly right if we want to the government to claim of our our neighbor's backyard and won't be long before they're trying to clean up our is right on the right phrase you know I'm\nIn the sense is I don't think he just stood with the city of Pensacola over across has been there for twenty six years I don't think he to push back against the city of San Diego and I definitely don't think that you know some of the experience that we've had on the law enforcement sad or is in his portfolio and so I think there's a clear contrast in and help people balance the that\nOh that's great that's great well attorney general Marshall we really appreciate you you being here give us the website will\n... Marshall that GOP is our campaign side the list a lot more detail about some of the positions that that we've taken in the issues that we think are important uh and obviously I still work for everybody that's on the show\nAnd then they have any information that they need they can find us at our website which is a a G A state that AOL dot us\nHe'll go to Steve Marshall about GOP and uh we just want to lend are wholehearted support and show up November six and vote for attorney general Marshall we need them back in the office and the attorney general Marshall by ... by me back Yes sir thank you\nThey've won a good guy I'm so glad attorney general Marshall was in ... it was a great visit with\nHim that really was and he's you know this is a land show and I know we get off on a lot of other subjects but you know all this impacts landowners and said oh sure and in our in our citizenry and uh you know he's a he's a solid guy he's the guy when\nYeah and if and if you don't believe individual freedoms monitor you start taking away stripping away some of those freedoms on the periphery\nAll that translates into your land ownership and what you can do with your private property rights are all those sorts of things matter November six go out and vote for attorney general Steve Marshall and you'll stay with us we got a great guess coming up miss ... with the Alabama Kalamazoo

association\n... yeah absolutely will tell us you know\n... you know there's so many things we could talk about and uh let's just go first into but which on everybody's mind uh ... let's talk about the public domain associations getting the bowl\nYeah I'd love to ah certainly a hurricane Michael wreak havoc I'm across the Florida Panhandle southwest Georgia in our producers and the wire grass area and um I was actually down there yesterday um or on Tuesday of this past week and\nIt um it is devastating and in many areas certainly the southeastern corner of eastern county I'm In in it it really impacted uh the entire landscape\nDown there um it'll take a lot of people coming together to try to repair damaged um and then also just try to\nTry to face immediate needs down there and our hearts and prayers are with with those those family down there there's farmers down there and from the cattle perspective specifically um it's been interesting\nYou would think that the storm of that in fact did see a lot of death loss and cattle but we actually haven't heard of that much uh our biggest concern is actually infrastructure so a lot of our producers I was talking to a producer yesterday\nAnd they're scattered out and a lot of areas across across\nThe town that they live in the area of community that live in\nAnd they lost thirty miles of\nHot tinsel thin oh wow yeah so you know a lot of people are scattered out in different different areas you know not one huge pasture lot smaller pastors and whatnot and so to lose that fence to have the trees down to lose a Barnes Phillies hey that they've put up this summer for the for winter feeding\nGoing to be a lot of concern there over the next um next few months into the next few years and so\nUm to try to address that we have set up a hurricane disaster relief fund or Alabama ... foundation\nAnd you can donate to that uh online at ... dot org dot ... excuse me at ... dot org slash hurricane relief\nAnd or you can write a check and send it to that money absolutely a hundred percent of it will be used to purchase supplies for these producers that were the hardest hit down there in those areas and um the hope is that we'll be able to take the money that we collect\nAnd match it with our foundation funds that we currently have and so I'm hoping we can get a pretty big chunk of money together in order to\nTo ... certainly federal funding will come into play with a lot of these situations for disaster areas that are named but we know that folks need to get cattle corral they need to get cattle treated they need to be able to purchase supplies and whatnot and so anything that we can do to help those immediately are going to try to try to\nTry to do that and and help our members and help our producers down there\nOne of the things with me to see a or was made to see a few years ago will now but wildfires out in\nTexas and Oklahoma Colorado and all those or is this how the Alabama councilman responded to that and in so many things to raise funds I Know we went to an auction where one gal was ... to ... to auction off go up and then just sending out there and so\nWe talked about it on the show several years ago but reformers are big their neighbors even though they might not your you know quite Joni might not be touching Houston Joni those count them under their neighbors aren't they\nAbsolutely um they they made by their ... and clay county or today you know they may sell cattle here there and maybe they feed cattle in other parts of the state um maybe they talked to people in other parts of the country but the exactly right or whether and it was the blizzard in South Dakota where\nAlabama we stepped up and tried to help those folks Hurricane Harvey when that came out\nThanks so we've helped a lot of our neighbors in other states and really hope and now that it's us um you know hopefully some of that will come back and certainly we've got very very helpful folks here in the state and\nIraqi producer cat um and helping cattle men is is not anything new uh the farming community typically comes together when we have tragedy and disaster like this and I don't think this will be any different and um look forward to seeing the results of it and just being able to help our folks\nBlitzkrieg will listen to one or some other issues ... dealing with Roy though I Know ... that we had rumbled Churchill recently prices are real ... in or did a little bit better and you know ... what are some issues with your seat rooms bode\nWell um I think right now we're before the hurricane came we're actually in a pretty good position um as you mentioned cattle feeder kept prices have been pretty pretty good this this kind of\nRuined that we've had the last last couple of months I'm and we're we're about to get to the end of that quite honestly just sees analogy of the of the market um it was a it was a good summer we we had it\nWas a little scary at the beginning of summer a lot of people experienced a little bit of a drought then it started raining so I feel like the hey hey production was pretty strong most most producers I think got a pretty good ... put up\nUm you know a lot of folks are starting to to drill said for winter grazing um and that that will be that would be helpful or going into the winter months so I think um\nAs far as the farm is concerned we're pretty good shape obviously we're watching a you know ... elections coming up so we've been actively engaged in that from the political standpoint I'm looking forward to seeing the results of all that and I'm with the session coming up next year and then dealing with some things in DC quite honestly uh we work out the\nAt the federal level as well and unfortunately the farm bill to knock it pass 'em before September thirtieth so we're working through some things with that\nBut I'm really wanna\nOn his I Want to take a minute to to command our congressional delegation in our in our Senate a senator certainly senator shall be banned the chair the Appropriations Committee um we're already starting rates and the benefits of that um although the ... and ... there's a lot of our preparations budget said did pass that\nWhat does the farm I mean to you know maybe it's a piece of land for production clubs or cattle or maybe he's a farm is just a place you can go to relax for

an old friend on the phone one of our great sponsors of the land show Mr Ryan would bland flip land think network Ron how're you doing today [noise]\nGood how are you guys\nDoing great or other why listen it's good to have your own and\nFor our listeners out there if you if you've never been to land flipper land thing they will ... does a great job of advertising properties ... around the country\nOr just a great selection and presented in a way that it's easy to uh easy to to surge through and then land think provides tons of great information or to people who are buying or selling or or just want to know more about land ownership and\nRon Paul is the man he's he and his partner Tate a reading put this together and\nI when I have a question they run as the guy that I call it he does a fantastic job and uh and we always look forward to talking to you about the polls question that comes out the ... bullets and let's jump into that Ron tell us what was the question this past month\nThe question was a pretty simple on which we like to be a simple in general are just so we get\nPeople to engage we don't want to be questions that are long and drawn out and work ... different responses and so on but the question was pretty simple and that was a if a buyer if you were looking to invest time off pretty\nWell what would you prefer or written specifically recreational property would you prefer something his party or something that a ... I bought a fixer upper one or two that we need to customize to make your own yeah that that was the that was that you know just watched\nWell when you ask for a simple question if Jonathan ... is right and it is going to be a simple questions I saw that and think about ways around but I was really surprised at the end or how did how did the responses go well\nWe've got a I broke down or where fixer upper was Seventy and a half percent wow uh the responders said that they would prefer extra upper and then twenty nine and a half percent or a turning the operation\nWell that that is surprising to me I I Would have\nHonestly I Would have thought more people would have wanted something that they can step right into news yeah you know we were talking about ... it'd be interesting to see the socioeconomic level of the respondents because this kind of been my personal experiences\nAnd the wealthy or somebody is that the more by you know they they are looking for turkey operation as as a whole row and if you if you like me and John and don't have to\nFinish that I'm not looking for that old clear to you know that's not to do their own [laughter] run you are ... you have the benefit of having been away and broker or before you got into land flip and land thinking ah you know I\nI very rarely show or property to somebody when they don't immediately start talking about what they're going to do when they purchases so that that may be at a common thread that runs through some of this discussion\nYeah and I think a year you know like they said that they deal with a lot of different dynamic sure everybody's situation is if I owned by side and the sale sell side of the of the nation\nI Am she ... she'd seen all sides um I see a situation where you know people like to make it their own yeah uh and no two properties especially when we're talking about land or on our our ally\n... and some people why turkey hunting and then that's that requires a certain thought process some people like dust and now you don't have to have some water somewhere right uh you know if you eat during the Iran you got to have to watch a if you're going to have a ... a cab and a half hour motives that\nAnd and then there's also the ... be the fun part\nOf a project or we can sit down and we've got a clean slate\nAnd you can sit down and say okay what do we want to do with fish and and it's maybe something that you you plan on doing over ... years or decades to build a legacy for your family\nOr not something that you just jump friday and no I Do see we're shifting our society is shifting to a more um ah instant gratification and the more the body experience kind of um a philosophy or people don't have\nTime to write a spin on that created and the guy from the clean slate they want to just jump right in the ... it's ready to go when\nI get after like they like they would suggest they show a bad results for a little bit uh I'm with you Jonathan I Breathe that thought they would be a little bit more\nBlack I Would say more fifty right or I suppose to to um the picture of her but I think the ... yeah it is it's not or fish the say generally property that doesn't have improvements on its own you got to be cheaper than one that's full of improvement that right\nUm you know but then again we've got to pay for those at some point and some people look at it as a long term financial improvement over several years\nRight well I think that was really interesting question thanks for given southeastern group to the uh ability to sponsor that um and just real quick for our listeners um tell us about some of the neat things you just had a a recent partnership with some way and lenders from around the country tell us about that with land ...\nOh yeah guys were on a mission uh we're we're doing or some great things right now\nI'm yeah we'll cover in our backyard first and foremost is where you are strong here in the southeast which uh is this the hottest landmark and we get a false question on that for him to\nA ... on stage and southeast those big so we're in a good spot but he adds that show the idea for them to get their ...\nFinance and property and that's another question we've done in the past\nA lot of buyers say that getting financing and that process is is that most cumbersome piece of the\nLand ... land process of buying or wiring ... lands real estate right so our goal was to form relationships with the farm better association over the weekend his within a starting in our backyard here in Georgia and in the south east and then expanding across the country so\nWe as a war we've got North Carolina South Carolina Georgia or Alabama Mississippi and Louisiana shall we go down that covered ah we've got other states that are coming on board\nA very soon those announcements you will hear a and so we're just expanding from there so it's great it gives a land of the buyers are an avenue to get information on financing qualification and help solve sort of a seller's the brokers they get so\nThey've already started the qualification process before\nA day or even a before they get out there in the in the thick of things as far as the property and negotiating a a a trend jak to\nWell one of my favorite things and one of my favorite types of people to do business with other people that we really like and then
