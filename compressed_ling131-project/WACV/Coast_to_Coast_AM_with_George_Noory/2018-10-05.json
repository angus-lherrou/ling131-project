I mean I don't know if I classify shining the slasher\nUm but it's certainly a horror film and and and and ... and ... and a and a good one and I think it's what I mean where do you\nThese are these modern horror films are pretty how are you know the ring is Twenty years old you know so um [noise] you know it's a\n... you know a lot of them are are are ah you know whoa hold up pretty well um with age and I I really I think a Halloween but first Halloween\nIs really a pretty suspenseful movie and Donald pleasant this really excellent as kind of like the captain Ahab trying to stop this uh you know maniacal a killer actually not even maniacal\nThat someone from Nineteen Seventy eight man\nNineteen Seventy eight is a forty year anniversary of the original Halloween ... managing it's been that long my gosh [noise]\nAh and John Carpenter who of course uh gave us a the remake of a thing and I came from New York and a bunch of rather a\nOr films a science fiction a heat of the original concept was that it was going to be an anthology is that every Halloween they would do a different theme or different type of scary movie and the first story was called the babysitter killers\nAnd and they were the babysitter killer a and that was the ... that was the Michael Meyers story Halloween store kicked in and uh the character became so popular um the mask he's wearing they were trying to come up with a scary mask and and and what they ended up doing was taking a William Shatner\nStar Trek mask and spray painting it white\n[laughter]\nSo that's that's a weird Shatner mascot leery\nUm I Wonder how we'll feels about that\nYeah I don't know uh but uh you know ... and do what you know the fact that it's such a blank you know expression on the mask and then and not deliberately scary face\nA you know I think that that made it more uh more scary you know I think a lot of times they are newer movies they tried to car you're talking about the conjuring and some of the uh in that family of films there's an of bell which uh\nYou know the original dolled at the Warren or have been there a basement full of a ... object\nIs Iraq at the end all and we all know what raggedy and looks like and the one that they hand ended up doing in the movie they tried to make it look scary or it looks like something out of spirit Halloween you know and they and and it's just\nIt's it's a you know it no one would trust the stalled for to stack and you know they're like oh what a beautiful dog with the horrific looking right off the bat you know it's much scarier when it's something you least expect you know no one would think that that their little raggedy and all is gonna\nGonna try to possess them or haunt them are\nComing up on fifty years Rosemary's Baby can you believe that star in the early that either and that's been ... to ... she was just almost a kid when she started in that movie\nWas she was you know and that was kind of seen as she got kind of a controversial sort of a mob look with a short hair right she ...

I think it was maybe I don't know if it was crawling hand or just hand but they had the very convincing and crawl in body hand crawling by itself\nAnd I and I'm ... I'm ... and it bothered me so much to my dad you know if the rubber and that they feel great jelly and you know are manipulating with liar then ... and I'm sure that they would ban wrong but but it put it into the perspective of weight they're fun kind\nThis is this is this is a game you know this is something can make a ... this isn't something to just the torture me the truth [laughter] something for fun and I think that there was was kind of an aha kind of moment and I think from that point forward\nOr I couldn't get enough you know I was a high ... if it ... it and not just poor you know horror I feel is is that under horror an five five I think are under the bigger umbrella of fantasy of a\nI think the horror or is it an offshoot of fantasy in those ... and I I like all of that I like a John or movies I like a you know monsters and a robot and injured and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid\nI remember him taking me to see the ... when I was seven years old Mr ... oh yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted hill the original one with Vincent Price right I mean\nCastle house on why blind woman in the cellar man I thought\nHe would bring me to all these movies you know I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go or [laughter]\nOr when you just wanted me around but I mean all these all these movies he would bring me to\nYou know and then the the TV shows he would love to see science fiction theater in in ... in those kinds of shows right you know he'd had them on all the time I I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting and I'm you know into UFOs and the paranormal\nBut my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things\nWill sure you know in all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phones and [laughter] and ah you know all sorts of thing\nYou know I think that the curiosity for this a coping a supernatural you know I think it is probably the genesis or the speed\nOf a lot of um your your guest on your show who started watching these uh movies in and decided to go hey let's dig deeper what you know are there goes let's find out\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four version\nOf the Texas Chainsaw massacre gifts has had the heaviest wrap everyone was trying to do the tech string from absolute there there is hardly a drop of blood in that whole movie\nDo you think there is you think there is I\nThink the area is why you know and you go back\nAnd watch it and it was all thrown murky sixteen millimeter and it's the chainsaw and how weird their house was with all of a of mope mobiles phones and you know the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that what came after it\nThose are really I think they're really sloppy slap dash you know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get slaughtered kind of movies but really as the original Texas chain thought\nThey were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating they were trying to get a PG because they would no one was going to go see it\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho new shower scene you would think you were looking at ... moons every second not one to stab mean did you see in that shower scene\nNo I don't know point does the knife entered Janet Leigh body at any point a year\nYou know what's happening but you don't see it\nAt the sounds I think out a lot of that and there were a bunch of it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kinds of roller coasters you want to get you get on right you get on a roller coaster and you'd have so much fun that you want to

think that you know you you your ear to ear safe you know you get to put yourself in a kind of a mock a mock danger you know and and but really your faith and then you feel like you've overcome something and I think that it's just that that Russia I think it's just that thrill\nAnd and again I think it's for a moment there it makes you forget all the really thing real things in real life that really do terrify you and I think that that that's worth the price of admission by itself\nOne of the demographics of movie goers these days I mean I went to a lot when I was younger and I don't go to nearly as many movies now that I've grown uh I prefer to see them on video or DVDs or you know streaming you know in the comfort of my house\nIn the health was food shopping center\nHave any

I think it's a horror movie has too much money it it\nIt seems protected you know you look at the second Terminator movie you know it it it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one because it's just too much money and it feels like a franchise\nSo I'm no a horror film you know you almost need to cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it\nIt's not like a surprise in in ... the the the train coming down the track no one is going to knowing shouting boo is going to scare you you know so you it has to kind of be a slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why\nA lot of low budget horror films like not in the living dead ... grant\nA are incredibly scary [noise] and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell have made a living doing lower budget horror films happens I\nAbsolutely yeah he's like the Olivier really is [laughter] and uh you know and and I you know I got to interview him and he's charming guy and ah you know he uh he\nLoves ah you know he pretends he doesn't like it but he he likes it he likes the attention than\nHe likes paycheck\nTo paycheck absolutely you know and ah I'm evil dead is a is a great a film for an actor I mean he pretty much is carrying the whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these ... it's almost like a Chapel Hill where it just hits you just following him through all of these tap blows that they've created for him so it's it you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books that all seemed to have that horror type feeling for in a pet cemetery and things like that yeah\nYeah I mean I I like Stephen King films a lot more than the books I I mean but I mean I'm a film guy [laughter] people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange commodities you know I mean a dance is different than a sculpture\nYou know ... book is different than a movie it just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you know in the mood to read a book and vice versa and uh\nIt ... works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I I think that a lot of my favorite Stephen King stuff is all the short stories I think his novels or to a padded too long winded you know what I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man\nBut you know he doesn't know where the story ends when he starts he just he just keeps righty he he used to just as surprised as we are because he just keeps writing a and drinking and writing and ... you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it done\nBut there is NO PLAN going in a mall which yeah I think allows for him to the ... you know again it there there was no formula so I

thoughts on the fog and Santa has them which are two of my favorite a horror movies from the early eighties\nUh I I absolutely love fans has been a fan has them was a made on the weekend ah the ... the kids who made fantastically smoke dope all week and then on the weekends they shot bans have them\nAnd um and when they are in a cost to really uh [noise] you know took 'em all most of 'em when really long schedule I think it took him almost the whole year\nShe'd all the footage for the film\nAnd um but when they put it all together a it was a great blend aside by and horror and imitate it a lot throughout the eighties I think the kind of hark and that sort of blend of fantasy side by an alert you see in a lotta later or eighties films and the tall man stands as one of the most memorable screen villains a full time\nUh and the fog is truly creepy great film great atmosphere Adrian barb oh great ghost story about um the ...\nOr ... or Nineteen eighty that have come back\nWith a goal the crew the fog or it's just so good you know are still many great performances how home workers the priest which I think was originally supposed to be um\nRonald plans but I don't know what he was doing at that time but you know it it just a John Carpenter again we've mentioned several of John carpet assume Halloween being one of\nThem are they live being one of them the fog laudable and one of them so I mean\nJohn John Carpenter you know next to Steven King I mean John Carpenter dominated the eighties or with a lot of really wonderful imagine if there\nWere these inexpensive movies to make\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know I'm I think that the great thing about a horror film um the beauty of a horror film is that you know you can scare so even take sixty thousand dollars and fourteen million dollars for\nHim and he's now you have the right Mr view should absolutely\nSo so that I think that that's why it's such a hearty genre because you can make it on the cheap usually the darker\nThe more the mind uh takes over you know the less the shark he he the more effective jobs was the last the alien the scarier the alien was so you know there is a lot to the side of the it's very easy to over produce ... I think it's a horror movie has too much money at it\nIt seems protective you know you look at the second Terminator movie you know if if it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one 'cause there's just too much money and it feels like a franchise\nSo I'm no a horror film you know you almost need the cap a budget because if you put too much money and do it\nIt's not a surprise in in his ... even the the train coming down the track no one is going to knowing shouting blue is going to scare you you know so you it has to kind of be\nA slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why a lot of low budget horror films like neither the living dead ... grand\nA are incredibly scary [noise] and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell have made a living doing lower budget horror films happens I\nKept to literally yeah he's like the Olivier really is [laughter] and uh you know and and I you know I got to interview him and he's charming guy and ah you know he uh he loves ah you know he pretends he doesn't like it but he he he likes it he likes the attention than\nHe likes to check\nThe likes of paycheck absolutely you know and ah I'm evil dead is a is a great a film for an actor I mean he pretty much just carrying that whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these ... it's almost like a Chapel Hill where it's just it's you just following going through all of these tap blows that they've created for him so it's it you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books that all seemed to have that horror type feeling for it a pet cemetery in things like that yeah\nYeah I mean I live like Stephen King films a lot more than the books I mean but I mean I'm a film guy you know people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange commodities you know I mean a dance is different than a sculpture\nYou know ... book is different than a movie it just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you know and then moved to read a book and vice versa and uh\nIn what works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I think that a lot of my favorites Stephen King stuff is all the short stories\nI think his novels or to a padded too long winded you know what I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man but you know he doesn't know where the story ends when he starts he just he just keeps righty he he used to just as surprised as we are because he just keeps writing\nAnd drinking in writing and ... same interests you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it done\nBut there is NO PLAN going in a mall which I think allows for him to the ... you know again it there there was no formula so I think that I think that that's why as books are so surprising but I think at the same time [noise] you know a good director can kind of oil back down to it asked him\nYou know he hated the film the shining and the film is shining I think stands as one of the best pieces of art in the twentieth century so I you know I don't know\nWhat about TV shows that are dealing with horror like the walking dead and things like that\nYou know it's interesting because you know I mean the walking dead I definitely I feel like oh everything tonight of a living at yes
