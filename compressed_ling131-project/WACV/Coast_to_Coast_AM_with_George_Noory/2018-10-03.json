the man who\nSpoke so quite a quite a bit group also a big public relations steel claim a five hundred and thirty five\nSo a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would and and a lot of the folks there I think believe\nThat if they change light bulbs they can save polar bears ... if we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe\nAnd George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo there are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they they are well I have never been a fan of that because you know I I I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that and we need to fix that\nThere's real pollution went into fix that's correct\nI don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles a I think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbons in the atmosphere and anything like that\nOr at least for periods over the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago when we've been gently cooling since then although the temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd ah you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were ah many people are completing what are called real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment [noise]\nThings like carbon monoxide ... I'm like mercury particulates we've carbon dioxide which is a older was harmless invisible gas\nAnd when I speak to groups I like to say to him what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents for man made climate change\n[noise] well it it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and they it was on a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that the earth was warming in humans were causing as he was a computer model or\nAnd or within a year and a half the United nations form Intergovernmental Panel on climate change and just three years later we had forty one nations in the European\nCommunity signed a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion of the first thing is that the world kind of jumped to a conclusion quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last uh Thirty years or so the computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it to the temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears doing fine and then the second factor though is I think a\nMuch of this as being driven Ford by momentum by money mhm uh we have a wind and solar and biofuel industries we have dean says sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations\nAnd there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year\nOn renewables to try and stop the planet from a warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nIt's amazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days they've been talking about fears of one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nWell you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee a governor of Washington state just to post an article on CNN quote how the show\nHe's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer and that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree ... yet\nAnd I think it came from the sun\nWell I Do too but that comes straight from the climate research unit at staying in England the the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade maybe we've had a tenth of a degree in ... in Washington for a son to see that all these forest fires that caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work um the way we take care of her forests are for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved\nToday eighty percent of the world's waste water is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers there's a lot of swimming in the water 'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down in Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve\nWe have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nElectricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease it we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming\nAnd the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun it's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things they're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that you know the the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change keep butting heads\nBut I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\n[laughter] well if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh\nUm what was Hurricane Florence and last year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas [noise]\nAh we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida\nBut if you look back at history this has happened before\nWe've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states and these are this is really nothing new a hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century\nOther and and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see this storms are either getting more frequent are stronger\nOr the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never showed data comparing the past to the president\nWe come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green box Steve Steve's website linked up the coast to coast am dot com I spell it for you first name Steve G. O. R. E. H. A. M. dot ... dot com ghost insiders\nWell I'm going to end now Android who died on a boat listen live we're on demand anywhere any time and go to coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today huh\nTrue well that's a ... this is a book that tells you what's your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over is think outside the box so the title was think outside the green bucks\nBecause businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxer sustainable development there they are forced to do many things that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction uh and the fourth is a resource depletion\nThose for fears are really at the basis of all of our state and federal laws about energy I'm a and they're taught universities and taught in a high schools but if you look at the actual\n... problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so I discuss the Fort horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries or energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's a fun to read it say a\nColored paper back in a lot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also about a a eight hundred notes in the back so people can go deeper\nBy the way for its size it's a heavy blocked\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but there's lots of reasons we don't put it that way also hired a cartoonist and nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kind of summaries of some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nMore weeds climate change with what's happening I'm a I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you are\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that is could be temporary because Saudi Arabia's ... talking about turning out a lot of ... an additional oil production but\nAh we're growing very fast the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise]\nAnd uh yeah we're the biggest producer of crude now\nNow I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that the planet is God in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\n[noise] I tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time but we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a into camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I saw I think there's probably a combination of of some that his fossilized fuel but the others others that do come up from the balls of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the free to freeze fossil fuels I like to use the comes it'll hydrocarbons instead\nPoint one who you know one of my simple theories on why the abiotic theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that has pumped on this planet it's way way down there oh yeah Hi Lance dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you got to kind of wonder the other thing is a lot of it has been\nYou know found in the polar regions too and and those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but I Know we have shipped shifting to the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a it probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the ... of the earth\nWhat is the argument about overpopulation and that it's a major problem for all of us yeah\nSo Nineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world in up in until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy you know the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality we had a declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems\nAnd so a bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death from the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties [laughter]\nBut they didn't uh first we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled or by two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output but the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping\nThe fertility rate the number of of ah children a woman will have in her life\nEach woman on average is having five children during her lifetime well today that has dropped down to two and a half\nThat said dropped in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological a sort of a state we have more women entering the workforce there waiting to have children and they're having smaller families\nSo all none of this was for seen it all occurred and the great news is that we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years and so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd a benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles for the red cross and our affiliate KFI and as we were driving to get to the venue [noise] ah I saw things that I haven't seen in years you know because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in June ... strewn all over the place\nWhere there was this you know four new seats in Los Angeles yeah I mean I'm looking at his\nHomeless people in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so it really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call wasted dumped in Britain where a pollution\n[noise] uh it certainly is a it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though that if I might if I might comment the government of California keeps making housing more expensive\nYou know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand there they're going to want everything to have a electric car plug in\nSo he just had about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California those isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right what would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat the situation\n[noise] well ... ... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going in the land fills\nA vet piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United states is now starting the trend down are doing more recycling um but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before\nUm nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide particulates et cetera not carbon dioxide um so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide is what they're pumping into greenhouses in California to make their cannabis crop grow\nA bigger and faster its its plant food that's right or the idea that ah the CEO to as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these\nPictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China\nIf you can see the error that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gases number one is water vapor it's the biggest greenhouse gas to his carbon dioxide three has methane those are all invisible\nSo if you can if you can see the year you got to clean that up but the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution\nOr so we need we need to get our our uh aims at the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nSea you've talked about in upheaval coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of upheaval is this\nWell we've had a basically a rate payer revolts now in Australia just this last summer in Australia um we had a a Scott Morris and uh\nThe new uh ... minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out and leading the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is cold for withdrawal from the Paris accords\nUm the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices while we keep the lights on wait a similar thing open Ontario by the way both Australia in Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled over the last ten years\nUp in Ontario a premier Doug Ford took over and within a month he had cancelled more than a hundred wind and solar a contracts they eliminated I'm a ... the fourteen thousand dollar Canadian electric car credits\nAnd now we have five provinces opposing the Canadian carbon tax\nThat California has said so we got to rate of pay revolts going on in California says they want to be a hundred percent renewable from the power plants are electricity rates right out there right now are are fifty percent greater than any other western state in the in the forty eight states fifty\nWe've got those at talk of pecan company don't forget

these works over workers fiction\nAnd the point I was trying to make was in the eyes of the world every thing about big foot is fiction for the most part what do you go before\nThe the Patty film or could date after the Patty thrown a most of the world looks at these things with a wink and a nod I mean when I have conversations with people about a big foot when I have conversations with people about [noise] uh UFOs\nYour typical conversation is that if somebody looking at you with a big grin on their face listening to what you have to say and then saying to you come on you don't really believe you\nWonder was a guy who called the program years ago when our bill was still alive in cold blood use any claim that he shot too big for it and had them and of course\nI don't know what happened with the guy in I definitely don't know what happened to the reporter big foot but are those kinds of stories in your opinion on Senate or made up\nWell you know [noise] what are we talking about George we're talking about one person it's like a he said she said\nWorried I Believe me the proof\nYeah I Believe that these people have no ax to grind I heard that story a when a or did it\nAnd I'm thinking about it the man was not being paid he could have easily just shut up and walked away\nHe didn't he wasn't trying to sell anything you know [noise] uh he was reporting what had happened and the fact was he like a lot of other people had a certain amount of guilt about it [noise]\nUh having seen it they really didn't know what to do with it they knew they was going to possibly be some repercussions and so they buried them a I've had a couple of encounters a\nWhere animals have been killed was said to have been killed one of them are words in self defense [noise]\nAnd uh this man for this thing was going to kill him [noise] uh and what are you to say about that am I to say you know he'll run for doing that you should have you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't have pool\nIn a manager there and that's a difference than just going out into the wild to look for one to shoot it\nWell that's that's correct you know if you'd like to get the well I don't know let me let you continue I have so many things Erica\n... we will do that and we've got a break coming up in a couple of miniature ... but a ... uh like I said I have some\nPeople uh who have seen bodies a couple of guys have shot them and as far as the bugs are concerned\nI thought he knew his firearms I thought he knew his a bullet [noise]\nUh it didn't seem seem very real to me and there's a lot of people uh down shown a ended his neck of the words that do go out on the night on a I have a couple of uh accounts were guys were out hog hunting feral\nAre which is becoming a big problem down\nHow it's huge and try and are\nThere are people actually being hired out now by a farmer's land owners\nAre because they're in fear of the children are getting attacked by these boards and whatnot then hiring people to go on their property they go out at night they have lights they're riding around some of them have electric basically golf carts so they could ride around rather a ...\nAnd they're you know trying to gain an upper hand on somebody's I personally I think there shoveling against the tide [noise]\nBut um [noise] people feel like they have a need to try to take some of these animals down a thankfully as they're doing it to me there's going to you know food kitchens and whatnot but it's a it's a real problem\nI had a call ... year ago\nFrom an individual who was fishing\nAnd he caught to trout and he said as soon as he kind of realized what was going on she saw a big forward looking at him about eight feet away and he said he's holding the two trials the guy is in the big foot\nLooks at him and he went oh my God what am I going to do so in a panic he handed the to travel to the big foot and the big foot took them what's at them and gave one back now does that sound real to you or do you think the guy called and made it up\nWell I'll be honest with you or that is most of the most on memorial ...\nOr if I heard that I Would have discounted a entirely however having said that I had a gentleman that was canoeing in Vermont and uh he had taken a lake in to a creek\nLet's hold on to that story while you were going to take a break we'll come back and talk about that I always had suspects about that a fishing stores but let's get yours when we come back [noise]\nGoes to ... the new version of that goes to goes to a a map is now available for I'm going to end now androids ... listen live we're on demand anywhere any time\nI go to coast to coast am dot com and downloaded to the\n\nLearned for yourself flight and she was ranked number one for

P. A. C. E. two three seven nine one three\n[noise]\n\nSaying well come back to coast to coast we're here with William she is the author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when a break got us\nIs a war this gentleman was a canoeing in a creek are up in Vermont and really he was poured urging stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and [noise]\nAnd uh he was lining up some trout on Iraq near him as he was coaching them maybe was camping undecided the creek and there's plenty of course being the cook 'em up for dinner\nSo he had caught a few book ... lead among the rock and when he turned over the Trump were gone now his first instinct was the raccoon Kokomo raccoons took them and I've actually had happened to me fishing connect quiet river or wherever I\nA little world full in the bushes and I turned my head and the rainbow ahead laying up on the side of the river [noise] ah I see a raccoon that gets\nLeft and right grabbed it and went back into the grid so I Know this happens and that's what he thought so a little later on he was putting more fish up there when he saw a long\nArm and out at all emotion\nGrasp the pile of fish not just one fish in one school grid numerous fish and retract it back into the weeds\nAnd that when he saw that it was game over because he knew this was something in the woods said he hadn't bargain for and the problem was that where it had reached out at ground level his Ken was set up about fifty feet away from them\nSo shortly thereafter that he\nGot the guts to go over there and repack up his tent and started to make his way out with the canoe\nBut he had said that he thought it was a big foot obviously what else has a long hair rearming began burning standing out of the bushes and then he also realize that this thing had to have been calling on its belly\nIn other words will be sneaking along kind of like a soldier trying to sneak up and signing up on somebody and was able to know that he was fishing saw him fishing so when he was doing by placing these fish on the rock and then had positioned itself\nOr in such a way where it could get up there and get the fish and retreat back into the woods without being seen but according to him when he saw the first group of British missing he was actually hitting on a rock smoking is pipe\nAnd he had his peripheral vision looking out towards the rock now now being mindful he wanted to catch the raccoons and the act [laughter] what he was not a raccoon at all and uh he was pretty it was pretty frightened or for that\nAnd and tell us which these reports on a people describe the creature in terms of height they're all big but how big\nIt will it it really varies I Would say a minimum you're talking a seven feet tall a and I had a whole point he had\nA a lot of people say the comical shape to there's varieties of ... a hair for coloration ranging from like ... salt and pepper to a\nA lot of people use the term or burn or read a and then of course brown and black sort of seems to be variety and then we have two different basically physique\nUh it seems that you either have these kind of almost cylinder ... body very burly\nA beer like for lack of a better term and then there's the other one that appears again and again and it's described as being like a weightlifter or a ... you know Arnold Schwarzenegger to the tenth degree type of body extremely muscular\nOr the chest you know Bolger thighs you know just like a a real monster\nSo these are these are the things that people are seeing and then it just varies a I had one I'm a one story called decreased and an incident I named it\nWhere this fellow claimed that his trees stand who is twenty five feet in the tree which put his feet at something like twenty feet and this sasquatch and a group of voters sasquatch has\nIt seemed that the group was distracting him making our little noises in the woods while he was both hunting and he couldn't see because of the density of the trees and the thought that was laying in this valley in the early morning\nHe recognized as a hunter that these our little noises one not real in other words they were being mimicked\nAnd that he was kind of paying attention to this and sorting out the pieces a sasquatch snuck up on him from the rear and gently grab the hero of his boom [laughter]\nThink about how big this thing had to be [noise] even if he was wrong in this measurement\nNobody hits the tri stand ten feet off the ground\nI mean he said twenty five feet so what if he was at twenty feet and it's people read I don't know Seventeen something had to have tremendous height and reach\nBut the amazing thing about that story was the way he said that the creature gently grabbed his boot [noise] and he jumped to the point where he almost fell out of the stand and when he looked down this thing was looking up at him\nAnd he commented how he almost or what that is just wanted him to know that they can do that that they could sneak up on him and ... and then left the scene and everything went quiet again\nGeez now the name of your book big ... in the woods tell us about the terror portion what what's going on out there\nI mean first of all when we talk about terra or when we use the word bizarre\nUh in regards to big foot I ... I take the stand as to what is more terrifying [noise]\nIs it ... is it not enough terrifying to see a ten foot tall monster walking across the shoulder road or is it more terrifying to have one flanked you in the woods or when you're hiking with your girlfriend\nThese things are out there they're frightening people\nAre a lot of encounters or somewhat casual wear this scene from afar and then the people exit hastily but then there's other ... encounters where it's my opinion these things don't want the people to be where they are\nAnd they seem to exhibit behavior that in my opinion they're chasing the people out\nThere wants to monitor the regents for so they they\nDon't want them there and I think if you push the envelope\nA you're going to be in the sorry state of affairs or when you talk about this gentleman that city had to fish and the the big foot walked over and he gave 'em to him he gave them one by telling me right now George\nThat big foot if I see that big foot I'm going to get wheels like ... I mean [laughter] we're going to speed up the film real and my legs are going to be turning like the wheels on a car running out of their\nWilliams does anybody record be the big ...\nI have a I Do have an account or this is very interesting another fisherman and here's the thing George\nI Believe that aside from the accidental sightings which there are numerous ones the vast\nMajority of these sightings or being hand by people who are out there doing things that your normal person when they say normal I don't mean like the abnormal normal but\nThey're doing things are involved in things that the average person does not do their hunters and fishermen there in remote areas uh the loan\nPeace of mind to exercise whatever the case may be and in so doing they enter into this room where these creatures seemed to be a now getting but he does and what we were just talking about I just said\nTraining area where you can do TR X. box jumps out a lot more offered no extra cost there's even an indoor track which I use a lot and a computerized string system and it's a place where everybody knows your name you get all this for one price under one roof only got metro fitness metro fitness dot com\n[noise] from\nChevrolet Master control so this is W.

said it was not a knock at all so that was really interesting that somebody had caught such a thing you know\nInterested in your opinion is it is it a blight gr man like\n[noise] I don't know George I

beer to me if it did that\nYeah but a little different or I'll give you this is this is really a stranger encounter a this was called the balloon is citing the balloons citing\nThis guy had been given a gift certificate by his new wife for his birthday for balloon rides he always wanted one I bet he was afraid of heights and his wife didn't know it [laughter]\nSo the fact that they came one day went ah to meet up with this balloon is out in the field\nAnd uh he was scared out of his would split the he fought through it and they went for a ride and here's the guy\nOr to try to keep the balloon as low as possible and the guy kind of went to them and said you let me know when you get really uncomfortable and he said they were about five hundred feet drift than over this farmland in woodland [noise]\nBut he is what happens which is really a unusual they got to a point in their flight they will all the people in the ... with them by the way it was like just him and his wife to probably a five or six people in their [noise]\nThey got to a point where the pilot or the balloon lowered the balloon over a wooded area so that the gun ... was scraping the branches\nAnd they came down and did that and everybody was cheering and everything you know we're trying to grab a belief or if the tree and all of this [noise] then he'd lifted it back up again\nAnd they made it across the next field he did it once again he lowered it down and they just moving slowly along scraping the tree top and they all started cheering now he said you'd think they won the lottery the way the people who are carrying on and it's gone Dover but here\nIn where the big foot comes in\nWhen they're scraping over the second series of trees that was bordering a field\nBusting out that the tree line as the balloon is guided all gliding along comes this big foot he starts out with walking quickly looking over your shoulder and the guy said I Swear he was looking directly at me\nEverybody said look at that and one lady\nThey kept bloody who can't control the balloon this fellow said that after this thing think took several you know very long and fair strides walking is he the deck on or fours and choke off he hid it looked like a racehorse at the Belmont\nRaise you see that's unusual isn't it\n[noise] well I I mean you know I've heard of this I I have a story and one of the books that cold along came a spider [noise]\nWhere these guys were hog hunting showed here we go back I told you had some accounts of a federal log on to\nThese guys were hall county and they were sitting in the field or coming up on dust\nWaiting for the songs to come down out of the trees the over the ... mountain the field they were in the tall grass and the grass was sporadically patch and all the words that were clear areas and areas of hardware aggress\nWorking away round this field they sure what he described as a furry army helmet\nSticking above the grass that's what they were looking at early shows like this dome or block for\nPeople watching this thing moving through the grass in spurts similar to like a spy to want to move quickly and stops most likely an stopped\nFinally they catch this thing coursing and opening between two patches and it's heading toward the hogs that they were looking at which was still far away [noise]\nWitness came into the opening he said it looked like a ten or twelve foot long spider on four legs with the head sticky up what they saw was the head\nIt's scary than to the bushes or the or the grass on the other side making its way towards large and as they were watching this thing it showed up and woman stood up they knew it was a big for it\nAnd sticking made a lunging leap like Superman dive on to wander horns\nSome type of quick moving on the ground

Iran\nClean celery me my criticism thing really looks like the real McCoy this was in Pennsylvania now in a circle Eighteen Seventy [noise] they're all in this one big caught up in the other big ... and and the second question I make sure that your new some men that\nShot a big what happened after the break could wish that why not go down like kind of ammunition and what kind of weapons that they are well here's\nAn answer your first question no I'm unfamiliar with the uh two big foot in Pennsylvania [noise] uh but I have a number of historical accounts one of them was quiet\nI'm a photograph taken from a a a grandparents' house after the ... final grandparents had died\nIn which was depicted a work camp in Virginia at the time uh that was set up a if the Roosevelt kinds of stabbed Bush the\nUh the protection of the parks\nAre the they needed to start making ... access to these parks and structures so people could go in there and stay in a bathroom facilities in ranger stations so they had assembled the civilian core of workers\nAnd these guys were in there basically roughing it in the wilderness in these newly protected or a wooded areas that but to become a national parks and they were regularly having encounters with what they called the hairy men\nAre in fact in the one in ... account in a one of my books called the hairy men one of these things came into the camp and tried dragging one of the men off of is caught\nAny older men attack that throwing a handout axes and grabbing guns shooting at the thing as it ran a out of their uh encampment\nNow but the odd thing is about these things\n[noise] it seems that shocked on fire has almost no effect on them are in fact in one account called the ... hunters this guy hit this thing at twenty twenty five yards with both by rules of a seven and a half lead shot\nAnd he said the thing didn't even flinch and kept running through a briar patch\nOr in answer to your second question about a big puts being shot\nOr in my county called the fifth bullet this guy was hunting in um I think was Idaho\nAt any rate he came to an area or in the woods where he was confronted with a mountains in a ridge line on three sides in front of him\nAnd he ran across what he described as a quanta taught me that sticks he said this thing did not randomly form there in fact there was nothing about this pine forests that lent itself\nTo having its quantity of sticks and branch bows oh bows and branches for them to in this type of thing any inside had about a two foot deep layer of branches as well as roll forming what he thought was like betting so his initial thought was that\nHunters had built this thing as like a shelter when they were out there but that was true no change on this region line that he had initially seen coming into the place he was now seeing\nA dark figure standing at the rich which started to charge in his direction down the hill\nNow he estimated that this ridge line was about a Fifteen hundred feet\nAbove the valley that he was standing in and he said that the ... that this thing was running down the hill was impossible\nFor me and to do one thing book to the babysitter ridge he estimated now than it was about six to nine hundred yards away from his position and at the time he was a hunting with a vintage Korean War vintage am one car being\nAs it got closer he leveled the fight on it and pumped around over its head thinking he would\nI had this thing as looking like the cop in the Terminator movie one that that the cyborg or whatever the heck they called the Terminator robot was posing as the police officer and how he was running relentlessly with the arms pumping and like nothing could stop them\nEven what what is going fired a second round out and he was sure he

they do anyway\nWell they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries their goals from the website or that they were want it to a race ambition reduce climate change and accelerate climate action [noise]\nUh some big notable Tony Blair former prime minister England spoke bond key move from the United nations\nUm actor Hugh Jackman uh-huh the man overseeing spoken a so quite a quite a big group also a big public relations steely claim a five hundred and thirty five million people were reached in three hundred news articles written\nSo a a kind of an interesting thing\nI think believe that if they change a light bulbs they can save polar bears ...\nWe all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo they are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they they are well I have never been a fan of that because you know I I think one Steven I think you agree more polluting the planet there's no question about that and we need to fix that\nThere's real pollution or we need to fix that's correct\nI don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles\nA I think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbon in the atmosphere and anything like that\nThere are at least for periods over the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago when we've been gently cooling since then although the temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd ah you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were so many people can fleeting what are called real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment [noise]\nThings like carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide so for a day I'm like mercury particulates we've carbon dioxide which is a older list harmless invisible gas\nAnd when I speak to groups I like to say to them what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe there are so many proponents for man made climate change\n[noise] well it it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and they it was on a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that the earth was warming in humans were causing as he was a computer model or\nAnd or within a year and a half the United nations form the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change and just three years later we had forty one nations in the European\nCommunity sign a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion of the first thing is that the the world kind of jump to conclusions quickly on this but uh you know for the last uh Thirty years or so\nThe computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it to temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears doing fine\nAnd then the second factor though is I think a much of this is being driven Ford buddy momentum by money ... uh we have a wind and solar and biofuel industries we have dean says sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations\nAnd there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year\nOn renewables to try and stop the planet from a warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days they've been talking about fears of one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nWell you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee a governor of Washington state just to post an article on CNN quote hottest showed Trump you care about climate change\nA warmer and that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had\nOne degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree ... yet\nAnd I think it came from the sun\nWell I Do too but that comes straight from the climate research unit at staying leader in England the the number one of the thirty on this one degree so so in the last decade maybe we've had a tenth of the ... in Washington for a sin to say that all these forest fires are caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work um the way we take care of our forests are for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous ... resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved\nToday eighty percent of the world's wastewater is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers there's a lot of swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down in Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nElectricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease that we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming\nAnd the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun it's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things they're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nNews no question that you know the the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change is keep butting heads\nBut I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\n[laughter] well if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh\nUm what was Hurricane Florence and last year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas\nAh we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida\nBut if you look back at history this has happened before\nWe've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states and these are this is really nothing new a hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century\nOther and and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see this storms are either getting more frequent are stronger\nOr the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties [noise] we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never showed data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green box Steve Steve ... linked up the coast to coast am dot com all spell it for you first name Steve G. O. R. E. H. A. M. dot ... dot com\nThe coast am map is now available for I'm going in now Android ... listen live we're on demand anywhere any time to go to coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today\nSure well that's a that's the book that tells you what's your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over his think outside the box so the title was think outside the green box\nBecause businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they're forced to do many things that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction uh and the fourth is a resource depletion\nThose for fears are really at the basis of all of our state and federal laws about energy 'em and they're taught universities and taught high schools\nIt's really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so I discuss the Fort horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries or energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's a fun to read it say a color\nPaperback and a lot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also but uh uh eight hundred notes on the back so people can go deeper\nBy the way for ... it's a heavy blocked\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but there's lots of reasons for legal put it that way also hired a cartoonist and nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kind of summer as some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nWeeds climate change in with what's happening I'm a I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you are\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that is could be temporary because Saudi Arabia's ... talking about turning on a lot of ... an additional oil production but\nUh we're growing very fast the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise]\nAnd ah yeah we're the biggest producer of crude now\nNow I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that the planet is God in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs and plants\n[noise] I tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time what we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I saw I think there's probably a combination of of something that is fossilized fuel but the others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the free to freeze fossil fuels I like to use the comes it'll hydrocarbons instead\nPoint one who you know one of my simple theories on why the abiotic theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that has pumped on this planet is way way down there\nOh yeah Hi Lance dead animals get down there\nAnd they're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you got to kind of wonder the other thing is a lot of it has been\nYou know found in the polar regions too and in those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but I Know we have shipped shifting of the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I Do think it's a\nIt probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the ... of the year of\nWhat is the argument about overpopulation and that it's a major problem for all of us\nSo Nineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world and up and until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy you know the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality we had a declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems\nAnd so a bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death from the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties [laughter]\nBut they didn't uh first we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled or by two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output but the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping the\nFertility rate is a number of of ah children\nFifty for the world each woman on average was having five children during her lifetime will today that has dropped down to two and a half that\nSaid dropped in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological a sort of a state we have more women entering the worst workforce there waiting to have children and they're having smaller families\nSo all none of this was for seen it all occurred and the great news is that we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years and so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd to benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles for the red cross and our affiliates KFI and as we were driving to get to the venue [noise] ah I saw things that I haven't seen in years you know because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in June ... strewn all over the place\nWhere there was this ... in Los Angeles yeah I mean I'm looking at his homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so it really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call wasted dumped in Britain where a solution\n[noise] uh it certainly is that it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though that if I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive\nYou know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand there they're going to want everything to have a electric car plug in\nSo you do stand about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California those isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right what would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat this situation\n[noise] ... ... people and businesses are actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going in the land fills\nA vet piqued about Nineteen Ninety eight in the United states is now starting the trend down\nOr doing more recycling um but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before um nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide particulates et cetera uh not carbon dioxide\nUm so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide is what they're pumping into greenhouses and California to make their cannabis crop grow\nA bigger and faster its its plant food and it's right\nOr the idea that ah the CEO to as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these pictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China\nIf you can see the error that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gas is number one is water vapor that's the biggest greenhouse gas to as carbon dioxide three as a matter of finding those are all invisible\nSo if you can if you can see the year you got to clean that up but the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution and so we need we need to get our our uh aims at the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nSteve you've talked about in upheaval coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of upheaval is this\nYeah well we've had a basically a rate payer revolts now in Australia just this last summer in Australia um we had a U.S Scott\nUh the new uh ... minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out\nAnd leading the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is cold for withdrawal from the Paris accords\nUm the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices while we keep the lights on wait a similar thing up and Ontario by the way move Australia and Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled over the last ten years\nUp in Ontario a premier dug for took over and within a month he had cancelled more than a hundred wind and solar a contracts they eliminated\nI'm a ... the fourteen thousand dollar Canadian electric car credits\nAnd now we have five provinces opposing the Canadian carbon tax\nThat California has said so we've got to rate of pay revolts going on in California says they want to be a hundred percent renewable from the power plants\nHow about a three time unit for only four

I mean\nOne of the great points that I talk about in the uh the second chapter of outside the green boxes the rise of democracy or the United states basically was the first modern democracy now we have\nUh just about I think it's almost Ninety nations set of ... that have a form of democratic government so it's going from zero to Ninety nations\nThe quality and freedom of speech religion rule of law lemonade show slavery women's suffrage personal property rights a lot of other things so the world is getting freer\nOh it's a very positive thing and it's all part of this idea that everybody is better off there's a lot of people going around seeing the world's gonna collapse overpopulation pollution we read always terrible things\nBut people are healthier lives and and one aspect of that is the rise of democracy\nShe what do we do with people's cars this to me is one of the most heartbreaking situations people who cannot afford electricity or their gas or let's say it's the dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it\nWhat do we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nYeah that's a tough situation actually the United states is in better shape than many European places because uh we have very low cost electricity um\nA crisis here in the United states they often put up a graph comparing Europe almost all year the nations in Europe have higher or electricity prices I mean we have here in the United states we have the lowest cost natural gas in the world are right now we're the biggest petroleum pollute the producer\nSo we said though that nobody nobody gets shut off during implement weather or can we say that\nI Am not going to get into that I Do think many of the the uh the utilities have that sort of\nPolicy that they're either not allowed to do that by law they have a policy where they're not going to do that during\nAnd they tend to postpone things in the summer I think\nHold on ... we got a break come back we'll

what seems to be the question that most people want answered\n\n[noise] well um there are many um\n[noise] you know I speak a lot to businesses and one of the things I I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the choir [laughter] yeah but the funny thing is though they don't realize that the majority of us business\nThinks that the climate laws on the energy laws are foolish in many ways the headlines or grab by a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and uh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of\nOf American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in the majority\nAre so it's a little bit of a strange situation [noise]\nUm [noise]\nLet's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong\nIs some is uh something that people come up with them it has to do with some of the assumptions um are they concerned about anything [noise]\nWell they you know back in Nineteen Ninety the United nations and the inter governmental panel on climate change predicted\nThat a temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade\nOr with a mix of five tense and low of two tenths and if you put those uninsured\nThose rights pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we we are much less than that so we're we're below the estimates for the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing the the rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions of the climate models are wrong\nAnd natural factors dominate global temperatures\nLet's go to Joe in Long Island New York they used to the Rockies Hey Joe go ahead\nHey they've interesting show uh actually I warm climate change I wanted to be warmer but my question\nA and a comment a got a quick uh my first question would be a we just had a and in fact in Indonesia unfortunately and they said that they weren't really warm\nThat there was supposed to be a week and that was working where the people kind of got out of the way this thing so I I relate this to a\nOcean temperatures how well monitored on ocean temperatures and [noise]\nA second question would be a political climate you know I only talk about the last couple of weeks twenty four seven as the uh you know Brett Kavanaugh are in his shoes and ... and um\nYou know it does make me think that the senators\nHave time to study science never or the tourist and really don't have a good grasp of science maybe they'd cook one course thirty forty fifty years ago and science and never really updated themselves on their own\nAnd uh you know I don't want to pick on trial is already gotten blamed for the recent hurricane or in the Washington Post\nAnd then my comment would be uh you said the nuclear read or a industry or was traditional\nAnd I think it's a like a lot of people a potential disaster waiting to happen I Know it doesn't contribute to climate a big ... CEO to or if you look at ...\nThat's still only buried at still lack of it's never been contained nobody can go within fifty miles of a place ... years later\nSo uh you you take New York for example you're going to the point right now and I'm a there's big metro area or something that happened with that then what happens to New York city\nSo you got a whole bunch of things that are I think there were three of them one was uh what are we doing with ocean temperature measurements the uh\nThe national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has I think they're the ones who put out these diving\nUm a measuring devices I forget the name of them again but they have thousands of 'em out there now but\nUh they've only been deployed for about a twelve to Fifteen Years so we really only have data on ocean temperatures are from measurements are over the last twelve to Fifteen Years before that it was just you know people will take 'em and chips and kind of measurements are going around and those were very accurate\nThe um the thing you said about uh what's um let's see ... the third one was the nuclear plants I think one of the big issues with nuclear plants that they need need to solve its I Need to be able to shut down automatically\nWe still have plants so most of the ones that around the world that are relying on cooling systems in the cooling systems the failed\nLike happened with the Saddam in Japan and then we have a chance for a big melt down so that problem needs to be solved um the other big problem with nuclear is is just frankly natural gas is so darn cheap right now nobody will build a nuclear plant and I think the third one was um\nSatellites boy you said something about governments and what's your question\nYeah I'm just wondering do I I think they know him and I read or an undefeated about five times in the U.S Congress\nI think the majority of it arguably more than half of the United states so members of Congress right now do not think global warming is a dangerous problem or most of those around the Republican side of course\nAnd as I mentioned we have we have we now have a climate revolts if you will in Australia and Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it uh this has been a disaster crisis for more than Twenty years now and we're really not seeing the disaster so\nI'm hopefully I've covered most of your issues\nI think the biggest problem we've got is an ex learned from the sun that could wipe out our power grid in a rigorous useless forever\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again of the uh if all those ... go off in Antarctica note of big bunch of him as south of the of the peninsula down there\nUm again we need to adapt as well we can and the biggest one is an ice age boy I like this warm weather folks I Do not want to see the start of the studies that\nWe've got we've got a guess Robert seem like who believes were in the early stage of an ice age more okay who knows Walter in Pennsylvania and taken away well go ahead\nBy Georgia needless to say great to talk to you once again George\nThank you Walter\nCharging up with all due respect to ... like a doctor Kimball\nGeorge with all due respect them is to grow them I don't think that Dr Paul Ehrlich there has been discredited though I think George I think it's just common sense that the human population whose planet cannot increase saw in the NIH them\nNow George we share this planet with myriad of other species are not modern agriculture may have been allowed dictated a\nYou know the ancient a bane of law and bought a modern agriculture consumes much natural habitat and now with the human population is driving them he thought station just as in this country are\nYou know we have largely eradicated the great a herd of buffalo ... oh so you know naturally you you couldn't have twenty million a\nGreat by sitting herds that used to be twenty million in a hurry you couldn't ... we would be compatible with agriculture wind up by some horribly wrong we have a\nBad some fields of corn and soybeans in week so uh you know I I just think it's common sense that the human population enough now to increase out and then all of them\nWell there comes a point Steve is they're not that you know you can't have a population of twenty billion people on the planet\nNo you can't and and you make good points well but the the the predictions are now that we're going to level of about ten and a half billion there is no doubt that the we've radically transform the surface of the earth\nAh we're certainly have done that and taking over large portions of it and I think we're sixty million by some at one time estimates are those days are gone there are some good news there are some good was by the way Dr like of the one set of who's a betting man he predicted that by the year two thousand and England with no longer exist", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Coosada", "day": "03"}
