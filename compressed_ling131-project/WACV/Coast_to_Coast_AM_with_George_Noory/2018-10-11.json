I guess they're going to give her full hysterectomy ah she's all upset but a ... ... ... what do you do at this stage\nOkay has it metastasized another word has left theaters and gone to lymph nodes and the liver and that kind of thing I don't think so okay well\nI'm your immune system as your best friend when you have cancer chemotherapy kills cancer cells no doubt about it but it also killed normal cells many people who die probably eighty percent of the people who died when they're getting chemotherapy treatment for cancer\nOf the doctors oh gosh you know we just we got 'em ... so sorry that we weren't able to to stop the cancer invariably it was the fact that the chemotherapy agents killed all the normal cells that killed a patient is not the cancer\nAnd so that's a problematic thing a with a trading with chemotherapy but as everybody's choice where they're going to get that are not the antioxidants and immune support is your best friend\nWhen you have any type of cancer any type of cancer and so was uterine cancer testicular cancer prostate cancer colorectal cancer stomach cancer lung cancer brain cancer\nI mean we could we could save John McCain repeated come to us okay ah he had a brain cancer other that actually caused by the patients have a single mineral and I'm a ... and so by the gate and chemotherapy instead of giving them the nutrients\nAnd and and it is it okay to do both\nWell many people do and do they do very well we we have one\nI Would God Forbid I Would I Would I Would you know because unlike conventional medicine in some cases uh but I Love natural things in all cases but I probably would do it ...

diabetes which makes up Ninety eight percent of the diabetic population\nAnd type two diabetes or is actually in a nutritional deficiency of a single mineral\nOr is not a genetic in any way shape or form it can be family because everybody eats the same way they cook the same way they live in the same regions and so it would be deficient that same nutrients and so we take people who've been serious are brutal diabetics for Thirty years in thirty days or next diabetic\nAnd so I'm involved we have to know how much you weigh how much you weigh Helen\n... about a hundred feet high\nOne sixty

yeah and so there's been hundreds of millions of dollars spent on this research was a wonderful study which has written up in this book ... ventures and chapters four or five and six in chapter eleven in fact people who did not have access to AK forty sevens\nWind up killing three hundred people instead of Seventeen like they do they have already seven or fifty eight like this to the Stephen Paddock in Vegas yeah and so he was deficient in that new state and that's why the government the FBI two months ago threw up their hand say you know we have no evidence of domestic terrorism international terrorism we don't know why this guy did this shooting in Vegas\nThat's because they did not do a hair analysis on him\nNow that single ingredient and I know you don't like to tell us
