going to go against my own protocol I'm going to call the parents\nAnd I'm Glad I did\nBut Steven read missing June twenty third Nineteen Ninety nine salmon Butte trail head outside of Sandy, Oregon about seven miles southwest of Mount Hood and for people who don't know a lot of disappearances amount ... around Mount Hood that I've written about before he was twenty four years old\nHe's an intellect super smart kid was a third year medical student the reports come from the ... county sheriff\nAnd uh when he was twelve years old as a gift for his birthday he asked his parents for the book called Grey's Anatomy\nAnd it tells you where his head was that he knew he was he was going to be a doctor when he grew up in graduated from college with a ... biology degree five data cap is similar come loud it was accepted Wayne State medical school first year medical school he was granted internship to the Mayo Clinic\nIn June of Nineteen Ninety nine at the end of a second year going into his third year he took his first vacation in eight years and he traveled to Oregon to check into some possible residency and so he was kind of mixing business with pleasure until the family wanted to see some wildlife\nMother told her son at the time never to hike alone please don't do that Steven on June nineteenth you flew into Portland international airport got a vehicle from run Iraq\nA Chevrolet Cavalier drove to Portland youth hostile checked in and pay cash for Thirteen nights I'm sort of paid Thirteen nights with his credit card\nNow law enforcement reports state on June twentieth Steven called his parents on their on his borrowed cell phone from them say that he had arrived all was well checked in things were great\nManager of the hotel said Steven usually left before the others will look he was last seen on June twenty second or the twenty third and he was seen at night in a suit saying that the residency interviews had gone really well and he was happy\nOn June twenty second he drove his vehicle from the hostile to the salmon Huckleberry wilderness twenty five miles southeast Portland and completed the trail permit to enter the same in the wilderness\nAnd they stop people here right now and tell you that you may think that when you complete those trail permits and put them in that little metal box that somebody's reading those and it's going to follow up and make sure that you come out\nThose trail permits are never reviewed and they only used to see the road of people on the trail there never checked to see if you came out there ... worthless some don't ever count on those\nBut on June twenty third a pair of hikers Stevens card the trail had early in the morning and believed it had to be a day hiker but they were there really early\nOr they accepted the trail later that day and they still solve the car there and it bothered them and they felt so strongly that something was wrong that they called the sheriff and a deputy came out random registration on the rhetoric and the vehicle came back register to a family\nAnd the registry stand been turned over to rent a wreck yet so the deputy left a message on the machine at the family who still owned the car on the registration system and he left\nAll Steven was return was supposed to return to Detroit on July second parents were at the airport and he didn't arrive well they called the Portland police tried to file a missing persons report\nSome persons report unless you were there in person\nSo the next day hope and Larry got on a plane and flew to Portland and the ... the search and rescue finally get down the trail and the thing that some assistance from the national guard Cain ends and search teams searchers faced rain and wet conditions for many of the days\nBut again the searched and searched for days after he really went missing\nAnd are hoping Larry praised the attitude of the volunteer searchers but stated that they were highly disappointed in the deputies\nThey said that the surge didn't last long and was terminated without finding anything endeavor dogs were later put into that area never picked up ... percent\nThey uh they had a psychic approach them and the psychic went with them and some for service people down the trail that came to switch back look down the cliff they saw little T. P. structure native little trees lying on the ground\nAnd they said that down there you'll find Stevens glasses and that's where he died a\nSearch and rescue went down there but they didn't bring their medical metal detector and it's like you said you needed that defined it but they never found it nothing was ever from there and they are hoping ... said that they are now any communications with the sheriff in years not never with the forest service Stevens never been found\nStarting a search was two weeks after the disappearance is a very very difficult task and right here I'll say that Carol turned her when she disappeared in her park she left left a message on the inside of her car indicating when she was going to be out\nNow I say this every conference and I said on every time on among the few people need to carry a purse to locate her because the cost about two hundred two hundred and fifty bucks there is no monthly service fee you can get them on Amazon\nYou activated it sends a signal to a satellite that someone needs help immediately they'll find you within eight feet they dispatched search and rescue I carry one every time I go out\nAnd I I Would say that probably Ninety five percent of these cases could be quickly remedied if everyone carry one of these\nOil whole lot of things went wrong in this case a just a a comedy of errors it's not very comedic though I mean but uh you know a search that starts that late you don't have much of a chance of succeeding you\nDon't think you do um first of all he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers probably wasn't dressed for success probably didn't have a backpack with them I doubt if even had a Geological Survey map of the region\nBut when you go in an area like this there's so many things that can happen or I mean I tell people that you could go down this trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active you could be on the trail five or six miles down and break your leg on the trail and die on the trail\nAnd that doesn't that hasn't happened because it has and something very simple like this can just ruin your life when you could just have this little device that could save your life\nYou mentioned about the psychic they got involved in this case have you ever employed the services of a psychic or have you ever in the end of the case where a psychic was used and they provided information that turned out to be accurate\nStory is um there's a remote viewer who's on coast to coast fairly frequently he will go unnamed but he he claimed he contacted me that he could find missing people and I asked him if he had ever found anybody any good\nUm and I said okay I'll give you a case and during that week that I didn't talk to him I contacted this victims wife I said hey that this person to help you and finding your husband\nShe goes he didn't do anything he never found him he never gave me any valuable information my husband was found on other means by other searchers doing other things blah blah blah on and on\nGeorge I'm a guy that has really open mind now will use anybody when somebody lies to me I won't use them ever again and that person blatantly lied to me\nAnd and other remote viewing cases there was one guy did a conference with a couple of years ago really nice guy\nAnd the information he gave me wasn't even close in the realm of possible now there's another guy who's a remote viewer that I'm trying to work with right now hopefully have better\nBut as far as psychic I did a conference in LA about two years ago and there were seven or eight psychic own this row uh uh this outside area of the conference and\nTowards the end I walked down this row introduced myself to every one of these psychic said what I did what I could use their services for and each one of them said yeah yeah yeah we want to help one out for sure yeah we could do this I email each one of them the next week when I got back\nAnd I never got a response from one of\n... about his newest book missing for one more on land air or water Mardi Palan a pioneer of the San Francisco rock scene died at the age of Seventy six this past week here's a part of his best to be right back\n\nAnd he and his friend went to the ... the ...\nEarly on that Monday morning and return states at the drop them off at a location and friendly at the super gas station or a Seventy third avenue\nTo twenty three AM and we own our peers corrupt pocket dial this wife while she was asleep when California and walk to link the voicemail strange sound screaming paintings growled at cetera\nAnd it's hard to determine when you listen to it if they are all human found or their animal found one already\nWe we have a recording of a news report that was done based on this and then includes uh\nSome of the clips from that phone calls so maybe we could play that right now and then on the other side you can tell me a little bit more about it\n[laughter] it's a voice mail unlike anything you've ever heard before [noise]\nThey're going to minutes worth of knowing that Darwin [noise]\nVery little actual talking so what are you concerned disturbing middle of the night call came from Henry Medicaid sound so it was labor date September seven to two twenty eight in the morning Nick Cage worried wide hurting domestic in hell phone\nConnecting minutes at a community services is a nonprofit agency an accent that go between the police in the Liberian community leader is trying to get help your family in some sense to me ...\nRolls telling the high pitch\nBlackness moaning and pay like moaning and being [noise]\nThere is silent didn't sound one either Henry or another person can stop it I Try to picture where he\nWas [noise] um [noise] went at night and like ... and and what made him [noise] sound like that\nWas now isn't stark contrast to other articulate recordings ... speaking at an event either state auditor when he was his\nMessage is one piece of evidence nouns police are reviewing the police chief tells me even the FBI is analyzing the recording and voices for Clinton did she says the investigation to get here on Tuesday\n[noise] his rights ... which borders you write in Mountain View and frankly all areas where McCain was recorded scene or sell some ... county water central searched they came up and\nSo that's a news report from Minneapolis television station or she the reporter mentioned in that report Dave that or the FBI was analyzing it the police were trying to make some sense of it have you ever seen any of that analysis or reports or did they come doing any kind of conclusion what the heck that was\nNever it climbed up so tight but one thing that I've written about and pass book is it the FBI follows these cases there's no reason\nThere are stationed missing person that's it why is the FBI sticking their noses in this unless they are interested in it for some other reason\nNow last tower that they pick up that phone was near Silverlake road and Mississippi street new Brighton one mile east of the Mississippi River\nAnd many of the cases I've written about in the past in missing for one one is sobering coincidence dealt with men very healthy men that were found in bodies of water many times in the Mississippi when this happened I thought he is going to be found in the Mississippi or something else really close\nWell the location where he was eventually found was searched multiple multiple times canines helicopter's ground teams everything on November second this is almost two months after he disappeared for twenty in the afternoon a kayaker was on rush wake up\nOne mile south east of the last time they cannot phone and they saw body and the water and they recovered it there was no violence at all to the body according to the corner\nThe termination on the count on the cause of death was freshwater drowning Syria had been search multiple times and the FBI had that recording for analysis why was Henry McKay in the water\nAnd one of the things that I presented in sobering coincidence about all of these young healthy men\nWas that many times the families did not accept the determination by the corner on the cause of death and they paid for secondary autopsy\nSeveral times when they did the second autopsy they found very high levels of GHB in the system of the victim\nAnd they were and level so high it didn't make sense\nSo GHB is commonly known as that date rape drug people get it\nThey pass out they realize that they're awake but they can't move and they can't react and if you think about this\nMany of the times that these people have disappeared never has any of their friends relatives et cetera seen the point where they disappeared sometime they disappeared amongst friends\nThey couldn't explain how they got from point a to point B canines couldn't track point to point a lot of times that happened in the winter and there was no marks in the snow point the point\nAnd if you think what GHB does to you it puts you in that state were you realize what's happening to you but you can't react so if they lead lead you say in a a bank of snow\nYou would die from hypothermia\nYou wouldn't die from G. H. P. intoxication if the police chew on water you would die by drowning not from GHB\nAnd you see G. H. B. is not one of the twenty six drugs that are screened routinely by corners across the United states it's only caught if you pay an extra amount to do this much more advanced screening for drugs\nAnd so it's a very very rarely if ever found in systems because most people can't afford a second autopsy and I'm not saying that that is what is in all of these cases but it showed up too many times to be ignored\n\nThat are recording it certainly seems like he realizes he's in trouble or painter agony and then as the reporter mentioned it sounds like there's somebody out there that says stop it that's\nUm that's ah\nIt is and in many of the other cases I've written about that are related to these water unbelievably the victim is on the phone as they are going through this transition of disappearing\nOne time not far from where this incident happened a college kids walking down the street he's on the phone with a girlfriend has and says where are you I Need you here and now I Need you here now phone cuts off he's found days later in the Mississippi River another time a kid in east or west or in Minnesota\nIs missing and his parents are trying to find him and\nHe's on the phone with him and he goes I don't know where I Am blah blah blah blah blah blah boom phone goes dead he was never found yet his car was found\nSo these incidents that happened were there on their cell phone is something new and different but when you listen to the incident as it evolves\nIt's very uncomfortable\nI mean it seems like they're being abducted kidnapped um and sometimes the bodies were found and sometimes they are and\nThey're they're just like snatched by persons are known by things are known almost like no one gigantic bird is sweeping down in snatching them up\nYou know so many times that I agree is calling me all the time and saying well you know\nWe talked about this earlier I heard you on this YouTube say this this is I don't say that and I want people to understand that this is not a conspiracy theory topic\nBecause I'm not giving you any theories I'm giving you All Facts\nAnd that's the way I Want people to understand is is that it's an unusual topic that's tied together the way an FBI profile or will profile a series of crimes were linking together a series of facts to show that there's continuity here\nBut there are patterns say and this book I wouldn't think that you'd have cases in the air um ah that would qualify under your criteria but you do you have a bunch of them and and it starts with looking at triangles including one that's here in Nevada right\nUnfortunately [laughter] yeah how did you ever heard of that\nYes yes there was a pretty famous a plane crash up in that area or Steve I'm trying to remember the name I'm ... I think it is yeah they got a lot of attention a couple of years ago um yeah and that but", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Coosada", "day": "01"}
