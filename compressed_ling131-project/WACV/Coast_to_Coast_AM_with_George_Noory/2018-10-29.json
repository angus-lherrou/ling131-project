Europe or something that I had read before it's about a very famous case or an Tony ... is\nThat this was an abduction case in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and ah I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes the government surveillance to all different levels tell that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean the the conventional aspect if you can call it a conventional um aspects of the story goes back to the fifties and it's a famous case uh from Brazil where the young man named Antonio ...\nClaim to being taken on board a UFO and as you said he had sex with these beautiful looking um I live in woman\nAnd I'm and fruit sense of purpose if he was taken on board against his will so he was abducted you know it was an alien abduction case\nUm we didn't you follow gee you know he saw the perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of an Sony unveiled expose\nAll you know it was a really weird aspect of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspect to to the story a which places an entirely different slant on it until\nNow if you read can fully Antonio ... says a report that he put together for um a Brazilian a UFO researcher and a doctor named ... tennis\nUm he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board\nUm came down and he started to feel weird as if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard base craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular\nAnd um he had like something on TALK like a dish that was speeding around very fast and he was making the Beijing noise and that kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shape\nThe the spinning disk on top of the road to the beach annoys says like the classic sound you get with a helicopter now among came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he's still didn't get very much a publicity he's nine was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to\nBritish to unify research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um the the abduction was a fabrication\nAnd the ... but he really did evolve a helicopter but they talk it said um they lost power he was out to the ... lights at night\nUm they release some sort of average ... ever so\nEr which incapacitated in Tokyo on board the helicopter and the the a woman was really that and the power was played out\nUm but he is in a sort of an old to states wasn't sure what was going on and that was then soda and ceremony asleep them back on the ground\nAnd the the the rate of the story was but it's the agencies within governments that might well and pain rarely talk shows but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine\nHow much they spent the fifties when the CIA eyes and Kyle ... and things like this the plan was to try and determine\nTo want to extend the human mind a bill to and you know in other words if we can convince people that I can say I aliens we can convince them of anything that was basically what it came down to so metal ... which claimed that um [noise] but the the the abduction if you like was played out\nAnd that kind of just then sat back and white to to say how much of the story was taken in and when I realized that it's the story of beta and Bryce by you follow Jay and it was prepared named books it was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets to think that that it's something beyond just some alien presence that there's military or government involvement\nYeah I mean they say when it gets confusing if the you know if they're on January and I didn't have adoptions and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind and be altered I'm not used the UFO and go as the motel you to try and you know I'm the say how it works on people doesn't work\nSo you know it gets really confusing when the could be real abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around listening to their phones but not investigating the abductions themselves the phenomena itself or are they doing both and just not telling us\nWell I think there's good evidence that it's um it's actually both because some of the things that I spoke with\nSaid that they thought it was number of occasions I'd actually being visited by military personnel and it wasn't like a a traumatic\nThreatening at my base situation it was more of these military personnel were actually approaching the pace quietly\nRequesting that they didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't some some of them have\nBasically the ... it was as if the military were asking questions um along the lines of well can you give us some insights as to why this is being done so in other words I was trying to get to the hearts of what the abductions where and why they were being done\nBut you know the ... says there is good evidence also of um surveillance of the of the job that pays a good example and somebody um it was tied to coast to coast I'm Greg bishops\nI'm Greg tell me how um he had to pay you to correspondence in the Nineteen nineties or with dumped caller Turner who wrote a number of ...\nAnd Greg tell me how you know back in the early nineties you know sort of pre Internet era I'm old I'm ... I wrote to each other back and forth or out on sale and with type\n... diabetes can clearly be done you know age lately that make it it looked like there was torn up for re failed\nIt was all about so safe whoever was doing base while I'm Greg I call it turned out to know that someone was opening their mail in other words it was sort of ... hey you know we're watching here and that went on you know for for quite a period\nOf ... working tonight as our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was mentioned that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know are not as credible as Greg who are sure that the government's watching him and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes people can become sort of paranoid of every little thing in their life you know\nUm which is a dangerous road to go down um but in saying that I made another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many papers so Shiite and we've ...\nI'll tell you what network let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side a save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions but we got some other ground to cover before then we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons live like in Seventy one\nJoined the coast to coast idiom Facebook page with thousands of members Greek for show updates in connecting we'll just go to Facebook to calm slash goes to ... pm and click like but\n\n\nAnd in combined with the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book [noise]\n[noise] well I think you know the the black ... to phenomena and I'm clearly a real one um they do seem to be tied to both capital mutilation and I'm In abduction phenomena and\nOne of the things such as being no taste and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea\nThat these whoever's flying these helicopters\nPotentially I think is part of an organization that operates outside of government you know my actually it may sort of do research and work for the government but it's not you know the CIA or anybody like that ... I don't think I think it is sort of um\nYou know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work and ... and most people in government don't know anything about it at all because it might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government itself you know it might have been even\nSort of ... to private corporations which again would make it more difficult to get material for the pay for my snacks when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by\nA by the fate and information request\nSo in that sense I think\nYou know the the phenomena in these rail and I think whether it's kind of mutilation Zora abductions the Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out\nWhat's going on you know there there's so many cases of black helicopters and an ... helicopters turning up neither homes sometime precariously the homes of a leading up to ... and again kind of light with college senator and Greg\nBase might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abductees 'em and be able to to respond at high speed a fit in the\nEvent that these people flying ... were actually able to ... an abduction going ahead you know in the ... so that very time\nSomebody who's a tune in tonight for the first time it\nHas to think we're all crazy alien abductions cattle mutilation black helicopters and we're saying yeah stuff happens\nBut the files that you've obtained from US government from the u._k. government\nSheds light on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is that there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on that the dirt agencies different agencies and government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about who's responsible and why this stuff happens\nWell yeah I mean that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies\nHave the information to themselves unless they used to be shed and if we daily wave as I said a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to\nA private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult but I mean in terms of the files on the um\nOn the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages I'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files\n... says that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the ... the the ... and I'm bored of the United states in in the ... to Seventy five\nAnd ... and just various other cases including some from the u._k. when there was a wave of activity of UFOs\nIn Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas so I think we're seeing a pot and and then I think the violence and intimidation a sort of the the mine coal and cause the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences or to literally\nPhysically real or not it it's tough to to\nEven though there are some really well documented cases it's tough to figure it out it's tough to figure out what someone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up bubbles are in the in the book and I should mention that there was a film coming out about those are it'll be\nThe thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the germ ... got to come out in December and then there's a book\nThat's going to be published I think after the first year and a lot of interest in the case but your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\n[laughter] well yeah I mean you know ... story is always intrigued me a lot of people dismiss you add rides but one of the things I've always found about ... is unlike a lot of people who hoax things\nThat you follow gee you know when this story runs out a few um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on um you know they are and I think the big difference we lose our\nAge he never embroidered on the ... the original story he told as it was he's never expanded on it if he tells the same stories at eight Thirty years ago he hardly tried to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and\nHowever many you know dollars and so forth it doesn't you know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average ...\nSo that's one of the things it's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections between the abductions\nAnd people who claimed that in some way or another the the the graze the Iranian Gray's who do the abductions that somehow they have they\nThey put in sort of sinister and disturbing entrenched in the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read out for the ocean of area fifty won't he was working at allegedly and I'm\nA said that was the aliens or whatever they are viewed as containers and um and he speculated on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the graves had some sort of\nObsessive interesting in the human cell and one of the things I talk about in the book is\nAn a number of abduct pays who were approached ... by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still ask questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you bought a veal salt leaving your body um\nAge you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of\nDo child wave the story that was always telling as well\nYou know you you look at\nYou up a topic in general and of course we've been told since Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force they stop project boo book they're not studying it is no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it\nAnd now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but that was the cover story and and now we've learned last ten months that wasn't true but there were ongoing studies that were more than one in fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably as ridiculous topic\nUm in light of the kind of of files that you bring up in this book where there are surveillance and there's counter intelligence and there's no disinformation and things of that sort\nOf do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I I Would think that people who are suspicious and are wary of this you know they ... there's some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle judge you know they they ... rail abductions fabricated abductions the violence the government itself trying to get its act around what's going on\nYou know you put all this together and um [noise]\nYou know it it really is sort of a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what he is and so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know went on the way I've written the book is to demonstrate what we know the says you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency might be doing this why why they'd be fabricating\nAn abduction event but then at the same time also investigating a legitimate events you know it's it's it's not you know where\nUm [noise] you know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines of really blood in trying to figure out what the overall goal is but there is but there is no doubt at all but you know that there is sort of extensive um survive and solve abductees\nYeah it's it's right out of the X. files everything is great nothing black and white um well we'll take one or two calls like east of the Rockies uh John and Virginia Hi John you're on with Nick ...\nAre you in ... thanks for taking my call a I have a story that might

Brazilian a UFO research or an adult to nine to ... tennis\nUm he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board um came down and he started to feel weird as if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard these craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular\nAnd um he had like something on TALK like a dish that was spinning around very fast\nAnd he was making a Beijing noise\nAnd that kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shape\nThe spinning disk on top of the road to the beach annoys fans like the classics and you get with a helicopter now among came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he's still didn't get very much a publicity\nUh the CIA and various other agencies\nAnd um he told a race to unify research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um the the abduction was a fabrication and the ... but he really did evolve alley cop to\nBut they talk it said um they lost power he was out to the ... lights at night\nUm they release some sort of average ... ever so er which incapacitated him to keep on board the helicopter and the the a woman was really that\nAnd the power was played out um but he is in a sort of an old to states wasn't sure what was going on and that was ... ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground and the the the rate of the story was but it's the agencies within governments\nThat might well and pain rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine\nHow much they spent the fifties when the CIA eyes and Kyle trim things like this the plan was to try and determine\nTo want to extend the human mind could be altered and you know in other words if we can convince people that I can say I aliens we can convince them and anything that was basically what it came down to so metal ... claim that um [noise]\nBut the the the abduction if you like was played out\nAnd that kind of just then sat back and wait to see how much of the story was taken in and when I realized that the story of beta and Bryce by you follow Jay and it was apparent in books it was the case of a job well done in the\n... makes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets to think that that it's something beyond just some alien presence that there's military or government involvement\nYeah I mean they say when it gets confusing if the you know if they're on January and I didn't have adoptions and then you have agencies fabricate taking them to try and determine how the human mind and be altered I'm not used the UFO angle is the most taste to try and you know I'm the say how it works on people doesn't work\nSo you know it gets really confusing when the could be real abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them or following them around listening to their phones but not investigating the abductions themselves the phenomena itself or are they doing both than just not telling us\nWell I think there's good evidence that it's um it's actually both because some of the things that I spoke with\nSaid that they thought it was number of occasions I'd actually being visited by military personnel and it wasn't like a a true will not seek\nThreatening at my base situation it was more of these military personnel were actually approaching the pace quietly\nRequesting that they didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't some some of them have\nBasically the ... it was as if the military were asking questions\nUm along the lines of well can you give us some insights as to why this is being done so in other words they were trying to get to the hearts of what the abductions where and why they were being done\nBut you know the ... says there is good evidence also of um surveillance of the of them to take a good example and somebody um it was tied to coast to coast I'm Greg bishops\nI'm Greg tell me how um he had to pay to correspondence in the Ninety\nChina who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was enough to have had a shelf and Greg tell me how you know back in the early nineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of a ... I wrote to each other back and forth were opened and sailed back which type\nAnd um now these can clearly be done you know age late without making it look like am I was taught to won't open race failed\nIt was all about so safe whoever was doing base while I'm Greg I call it turned out to know that someone was opening their mail in other words it was sort of like an intimidation hey you know we're watching you and that went on you know for for quite a period\nOf ... working tonight as our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name I was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it I mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know are are not as credible as Greg who are sure that the government is watching him\nAnd I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes people can become sort of\nParanoid of every little thing in their life you know um which is a dangerous road to go down um but in same batch I mean another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many papers show Shiite that with ...\nI'll tell you what they were let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side I'll save some time so people can ask a couple of questions but we got some other ground to cover before then we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons I for making Seventy one\nJoined the coast to coast idiom Facebook page with thousands of members Greek for show updates in connecting with those ... dot com slash ... him and click the like button\n\n\nAnd in combined with the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book [noise]\n[noise] well yeah I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and I'm clearly a real one um they do seem to be tied to both capital mutilation and um [noise] the Eileen abduction phenomena and\nOne of the things such as being no taste and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that\nThese whoever's flying these helicopters\nPotentially I think he's part of an organization that operates outside of government you know it might actually it may sort of do research and work for the government but it's not you know the CIA or anybody like that ... I don't think I think it is sort of um [noise]\nYou know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work and ... and most people in government don't know anything about it at all because he might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government itself you know it may be even\nSort of ... to private corporations which again would make it more difficult to get material for the feed from Iceland act when you're dealing with private corporations which on covert by\nAh by the fate of information request [laughter]\nSo in that sense I think\nYou know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... abductions the Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out\nWhat's going on you know there there's so many cases of black helicopters and on ... helicopters to an end up near the homes sometime precariously they the homes of a leading up to ... and again kind of light with college senator and Greg\nThey might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abductees 'em and be able to to respond at high speed a fish in the\nEvent that these people fly Matty cups his were actually able to caution and abduction going ahead you know in the ... I was actually the very time\nSomebody who's a tune in tonight for the first time has to think we're all crazy alien abductions cattle mutilation black helicopters and we're saying yeah those stuff happens\nBut the files that you've obtain from US government from the u._k. government sheds light on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is\nThat there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on at the dirt agencies different agencies and government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about who's responsible and why this stuff happens ...\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows\nA you know many many cases agencies have the information to themselves unless they used to be shed an equally daily wave as I said a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to a private\nCompanies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult but I mean in terms of the files on the um\nOn the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages\nWe always stay classified files on Capitol mutations I'm a wave of encounters that occurred in Seventy five in some of the the ... the the ... and I'm bored of the United states in in the ... to Seventy five\nAnd I'm just various other cases including some from the u._k. when there was a way of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas\nSo I think we're seeing a pot and and then I think some violence and intimidation a sort of the the mine coal and cause the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences or to literally\nPhysically real or not it it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented cases it's tough to figure it out it's tough to figure out what someone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up bubbles are in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there there was a film coming out about those are it'll be the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the ... got to come out in December and then there was a book\nThat's going to be published I think after the first year and a lot of interest in the case but your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\nWell yeah I mean you know it was all store is always intrigued me a lot of people dismiss you add rights but one of the things I've always found about ... is unlike a lot of people who hoax things and you follow the J\nYou know when the story runs out a few um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on um you know they are and I think that the big difference we lose our\nDays he never embroidered on the ... the original story be told as it was he's never expanded on it if he tells the same stories a Thirty Years' ago he's hardly try to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and\nHowever many you know dollars and so forth it doesn't you know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average ...\nSo that's one of the things it's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections between the abductions\nAnd people who claimed that in some way or another the the the graze the Iranian Gray's who do the abductions that somehow they have these\nThey put in sort of sinister and disturbing entrenched in the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read out at ... this is supposed to vary fifty won't he was working at allegedly [noise] and um\nHe said that with the aliens or whatever they are viewed as containers and um any speculated on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the graves had some sort of\nOf ... in the human cell and one of the things I talk about in the book is\nAn a number of abduct pays who were approached climbed dastardly by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still ask questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you bought a veal salt leaving your body um\nAge you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of do\nWell you know you you look at recent developments in regard to the UFO topic in general\nAnd and of course we've been told since Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force they stopped project boo book they're not studying it is no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it and now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but\nThat was the cover story and and now we've learned last ten months that wasn't true that there were ongoing studies that were more than one in the fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably as ridiculous topic\nUm in light of the kind of of files that you bring up in this book where there are surveillance and there's counter intelligence and there's no disinformation and things of that sort\nOf do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I I Would think that people who were suspicious and are wary of this you know they there's some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle George you know they ... they sign glove um rail abductions fabricated abductions the violence or the government itself trying to get its had around what's going on\nYou know you put all this together and um [noise]\nYou know a really sort of a a a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know went on the way I've written the book is to demonstrate what we know the says you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency may be doing this why why they'd be fabricating\nAnd abduction event but then at the same time also investigating a legitimate events you know it's it's it's not ... now where\nUm you know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines of really blood in trying to figure out what the overall goal is but there but there is no doubt at all but you know that there is sort of extensive um serve I saw them to phase\nThat's it's right out of the X. files everything is great nothing black and white ... we'll take one or two calls or east of the Rockies uh John and Virginia Hi John you're on with ... ...\n... thanks for taking my call a I Am a story that might be one of the
