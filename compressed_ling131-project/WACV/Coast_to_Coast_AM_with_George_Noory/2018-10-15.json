and you know what I'm getting ready to say\nYeah go ahead Barry it's yours\nGo Begley Cathy\nYou like that do you like to the area [laughter] okay I\nHad they were our love hearing is that all that it may have more do you place on great for me they gave it up and down\nAnd think Barry what do you have for a minute tonight\nI got two questions and then I've got a great little short clean quick about their armored collar just at the end\nOf the first question is is credited with Jimmy\n... uh the this cyber ring and learning to read hieroglyphics and then the second question is\nAll about Howard ... bakery in Egypt in that area of the world let's say an hour ago at the center of town and the pyramids of Mexico central and south ...\n\nIs the ... so the question is how are you asking if there are a hero cliff here were lipic inscriptions in Beckley taffy is that what you're asking\nOh no I'm asking is are the ... that are written on the ... and Egypt on a pair of ... and so forth and go back like that the all the same hieroglyphics that are found on the pyramid is in Mexico and central and South America\nAh okay I understand I'm not I don't think so they are there different hire their different ... and it's interesting you I've seen this question because you are you are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you you were saying that they're here lipic inscriptions\nIn ... in other words you're implying there is a there is there is writing they are\nAnd um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist I don't have any fancy degrees after my name is but there are certain things that are are in\nNot only on the stones at a go back to be but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they in the same I don't know there is an H M the belt\nThat looks very similar to the age blocks in ... who are are they related I don't know right there are some astrological signs in Beckley tabby [noise] are they are they representing the zodiac ... ah that were in then Darrow\nAnd throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that are they the same I don't know but I'm going back lead happy being that old certainly is indicating that they were the first than it is the oldest is at the same language\nAnd then that no I I don't think so but the the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic she'd like to I called up their Humvees H on the bells didn't lose one of the looks like but that ain't that ages repeated a\nThere's a very exciting possibility um regarding that question that they ask and go back to the um and it's regarding the civil that you mentioned Jimmy there's a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I probably I might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know what\nI'm doing right here on coast to coast oh there was one other one other point that I wanted to make about a ... a go Beckley taffy and it just got away from me bury it was right there but it just disappeared\nNo problem thank throw\nAt absolutely and uh the phone lines Manu I expected this ah are completely jammed up blitz going in one more call bring him on all of them yeah let's let's go to this is going to\nGo to my dad in New York my uh Europe next\nYes good morning gentlemen and ... and now new\nI guess I have a two part question than I'd like to know if he um\nHad looked at any of the pecan pie with the fact is that the highway of any age and I and I'm also I I think that might be the one that deals with the founding medical knowledge that they had that if if I'm correct on that particular one\nThe second part and I'll listen over there and\nIs whether he and and and Rob it and and ... had said that some of the um the African and African American scholars\nWho studied the net net net to add a which is the name of the language which is is is still out of that they're doing that to a phrase itself deals with this sacred\nAnd whether he looked at\nPeople who call themselves a huge cabinet for instead of the ... and you know before they\nDid Greeks gay men and consider themselves that they can that colleges can minutes when we got word from for chemistry and also um [noise] the what you call thing was that was it was ... degrees got came up with and to me\nWhat they define with the riddle is not what it is and the African American dollars that I'm thinking of they call it a little odd that arise and so they use that time to renew old saw oh sad if you follow him on my question and I'll listen over the air\nThank you dad great okay three questions and my new I'm going to get to them but that just goes to show you the extent of knowledge here with the coast audience or they don't play around on the\nFirst question um I I I Am all I have heard of the ... but the the one that I have looked up more specifically regarding medical information is the ... actually in my book\nUm because on the reverse of the eagles PR piracy there is an interesting calendar or that's fixed into colleges and I think um I found a solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and just it's a this was in the ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about piracy that's I think over sixty foot long\nUh it describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nUm and this ... I Believe the to the middle kingdom and and reaches back a most likely are probably two World Cups time so um yes there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nBarred yeah ten minutes and towards the name of Egypt of course Kevin ... that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was a southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly for medic um and the evidence from that comes from to mutate\nI think or the African roots lie\nOther script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt uh Mm probably from Bhutto\nAnd poodle was sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably ... with the live on and so they had a different kind of group that was mostly a fixture oh so it was picked up graphs\nUm so what you saw what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptians script was probably a originally Africa maybe you don't watch the hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south\nAnd she brought up another really good point before we get to the break we've got about thirty seconds\nAnd it was the Greeks adopting a ... a chemistry coming from candidate right\nYes the issue I think she mentioned it's getting so uh my uh we we think that speaks was making before uh before Crawford game I think it was we were I think it was a line is and they must make eat and by the way that's also probably an African of African origin\nLet's take a break ride here coast to coast am it's all Great Pyramid all Egypt all

save Saturday more talking about uh the great pyramid\nAnd the discovery of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid but his formula in his white paper they published last week and how to locate them and I want to say really quick Manu\nThat Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a ...\nAnd post your questions or comments about Tonight Show either for mayor or buy new right there and this question just came in before we get to a a page three twenty eight of of of this report\nA minute this is the question this is from ...\nShe says is it true that the measurements of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that does coordinate point to some where I'm In in the past that they believe are coordinates to have it in\nHeaven yes\nUm I haven't worked I propose\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience and and I guess like yourself there is so much information out there\nBut there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid yeah and this is one of those questions where the math of the of the great pyramid\nHas revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and that they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Allen Green who is looking he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able to connect uh the uh the title page of the sauna Shakespeare sonnet\nTo the coordinates or not to heaven but uh uh of course Allen might say it'd have a right to the corners of the great pyramid and specifically a a coordinate that Allen is discovered\nA fall right next to them off of him you know which is next for the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have 'em on coast a a very soon probably next month\nDean title page of the sun and it's with a Shakespeare\nAnd his work Allen greens work at deciphering that page and ... what is revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it\nIt is absolutely incredible and we'll have Marcos next month okay so now the the top half of the pyramid yes a U.S said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's a page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the the ...\nReport PDF the top half you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we had been told there are none\nBy right and so um you know when we talked about a um a confident you're Rudolph comfortably last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring the ah found is when you get some guns and brings door adjust pay for\nThe the the floor off the off the off the canal drops suddenly it's there is a depression and the way he is interpreted one of the two ways he interpreted that is that must be a space\nThat allowed that forward to cave in slightly\nSo that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know the courses that we've just been discussing there is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in and that might correlate with if I go back to three twenty six will quick\nThat could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth um and and then they go and so you know so there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been ah detected by me on scan\nAnd now the road let's let's let's get to this first second and the\nUh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting in a row eighty four which is a shaft\nUm and uh it is going up words every body of one o seven a and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction\nThat have a different sides of the different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as a show and going all the way to the surface and that's incorrect so I just used the illustration this is an older generation I'm so that if that particular chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yeah so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of forty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basically establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ring in other words\nThere is a space and and designed space not not you know an accidental space a design space that correlates with each one of these particular courses\nNow you just got back from Egypt yeah we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project their which uh did help find this cavity this new chamber above the grand gallery you describe what you saw it\nRight so I saw new detectors being placed um I at this time in a different location and last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up to a grand gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed as the scanning\nNow for the audience tell them what to move on detectors actually do where do they used for\nBy so these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so when the cosmic radiation hit the atmosphere a particle called them you on has created enemy on is a negative charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a big heavier\nAh than electron but it can pass through solid matter it's travels at the speed of light is lifetime is just over two seconds\nI'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you can actually go for a person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs and in this case you can basically quote unquote X ray to pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then uh it showed ... then you have a chance\nTo see his face a because the yarns will travel more rapidly through open air then you know through solid stone so if you have a space in the ... way of what you're what you're looking for than those viewers will arrive more rapidly and they ... and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors placed in the grand gallery could they be used to find the\n...\nThe chambers that you were proposing in the upper half of the pyramid\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifact tool and I think they using this angle to confirm that the big void is real\nBut it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of scan of that yes that there could be some from the lower once maybe a you know on the graphic if we go back\nUm let's say seven twenty fifth and sixth twenty fifth it's possible that if there is a\nA is if there's a space on the northern side on the northern half of the pyramid that it will get picked up by the scan um it's also possible they put they picked a place in places that we don't know for example the you know the uh the chamber's above the king shaver\nAdam directs dot net location Mirren scheme\nAdams drag you

I might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know what\nI'm doing right here on coast to coast oh there was one other uh one other point that I wanted to make about a ... a go Beckley taffy and it just got away from me bury it was right there but it just disappeared\nThanks for al ... absolutely\nAnd uh the stone lined Manu I expected this ah are completely jammed up let's get one more call bring him on all of them but yeah let's let's go to this is going to go to my dad in New York my uh Europe next\nYes good morning gentlemen great tail Danny and now new\nI guess I have a two part question I'd like to know and he um\nHad looked at any of that ... pirate fact is that the pirates of any age and I and I'm also I I think that might be the one that deals with the is founding medical knowledge that they had that if if I'm correct on that particular one\nThe second part now listen over there and\nIs whether he and and and Rob it and and ... had said that some of the um the African and African American college who studied the net net net to add\nA which is the name of the language which is is is still out of that that do that to a phrase itself deals with this sacred and whether he looked at\nPeople who call themselves a huge cabinet for instead of the ditch and you know before they\nDid Greeks came in and consider themselves that they can that colleges cabinet is when we got word from for chemistry and also um the what you call this thing was that was the word that degree Scott came up with and to me\nWhat they define what the riddle is not what it is and the African American dollars that I'm thinking of they call it a little odd that horizon so they use that time to renew old saw oh sad if you follow him a ... and I'll listen off the air\nThank you dad great okay three questions and my new I'm going to get to them but that just goes to show you the extent of knowledge here with the coast audience or they don't play around on the first\nQuestion um I I I Am all I have heard of ... but the the one that I have looked up more specifically regarding medical information is the ... actually in my book\nUm because on the reverse of the eagles PR piracy there is an interesting calendar uh that's fixed it took ... years and I think\nUm I found a solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and just it's a this is an ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about piracy that's I think over sixty foot long uh it describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nUm and this ... I Believe states to the middle kingdom and and reaches back a most likely a probably to him all caps time so um yes there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nBarred yeah ten minutes and which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a group that's\nAn excellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so\nUm as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was the southern Egyptian culture and that script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from two huge a a king ...\nAnd roots lie the other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt uh Mm probably from Bhutto\nAnd bookstores are sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with a probably a pay me uh with the live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a fixture oh so it was picked up graphs\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptians script was probably a originally Africa and maybe you don't watch the hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south and that\nAnd she brought up another really good point before we get to the break we've got about thirty seconds and it was the Greeks adapting a bad analogy a chemistry coming from cabinet\nRight yes she I think she mentioned it's getting so my we think that speaks was making before uh before Africa game I think it was we were think it was the lioness and their name was make eat and by the way that's also probably an African of African origin\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast am it's all Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long or get tonight my new same day his paper is right there click on his website a coast to coast am are going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us\n[noise] just find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to ... am dot com\nAnd it is in the in the sun me a\n\nWay\nOf the sun it's with a Shakespeare\nAnd his work Allen greens work at deciphering that page and ... what is revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it it's it's absolutely incredible and we'll have among coast next month\nOkay so now the the top half of the pyramid yes a U.S said at the beginning of the show let's get to this is a page number three twenty eight everybody into the ... were\nA reporter PDF the topics have you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we had been told there are none\nBy right and so um you know when we talked about a um a gun to your Rudolph comfortably last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring the ah found is when you get the guns and brings door adjust pay for the\nThe the floor off the off the off the canal drops suddenly it's there is a depression and the way he's interpret one of the two ways he interpreted that is there must be a space that allowed that forward to cave in slightly\nSo that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know these courses that we've just been discussing there is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in and that might correlate with uh if I go back to three twenty six will quick\nThat could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth\nUm and and then they go and so you know so there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been ah detected by me on scan\nAnd now the road let's let's let's get to this first second and the uh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting in a row eighty four which is a shaft\nUm and uh it is going up words every body of one o seven a and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction\nThat have a different sides of the different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as a show and going all the way to the surface and that is incorrect so I just used the illustration this is an older generation I'm so that if that particular chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of forty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basic the establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ring in other words\nThere is a space and designed space not not you know an accidental space and designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses\nNow you just got back from Egypt yeah we have to discuss the ongoing moves on a project their which uh did help them find this have any this new chamber above the grand gallery\nYou describe what you saw in the grand gallery\nBeing place um I at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up the grand gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed that they are scouting\nNow for the audience tell them what to do on detectors actually do where do they used for\nBy so these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so when the cosmic radiation hits the atmosphere of particle called them you want is created enemy on is a negative charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier\nOr didn't electron but he can pass through solid matter if it's travels at the speed of light is lifetime is just over two seconds\nI'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs and in this case you can basically quote unquote ... pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then uh it ... then you have a chance\nTo see his face a because the nuance will travel more rapidly through open air then you know through solid stone so if you have a space in the ... way of what you're what you're looking for then those nuance will arrive more rapidly and they ... and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors placed in the grand gallery could they be used to find the\n...\nThe chambers that you are proposing in the in the upper half of the pyramid\nHe hated if possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifact tool and I think they using this angle to confirm that the big void is real\nBut it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of scan of that yes that there could be some some at the lower ones maybe a you know on the graphic if we go back\nUm let's say seven twenty fifth and sixth twenty fifth it's possible that if there is a a is if there's a space on the northern side on the northern half of the pyramid that it will get picked up by the scan", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Coosada", "day": "15"}
