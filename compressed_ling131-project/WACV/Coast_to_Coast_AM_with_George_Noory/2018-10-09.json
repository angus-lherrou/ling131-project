wonders of the moral of tomorrow and delights audiences all over the planet with his visited\nPresentations on the future of work in life and here he is on the coast to coast looking for love your cover on this book by the way Byron\nOh thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that the world of robots is going to take over the planet take you take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people jobs\nBut um other tests to my website you take to try to figure out of it at your job is at risk\nAnd it it records all the answers and very very few jobs actually cut a robot take over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or any of the thousands of other things people do and and I'm not\nA so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase in productivity and we we're all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about an artificial intelligence ... exactly what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[laughter] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex and you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what they what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing\nIn common so they either me or what you see in the movies so commander data upstart trucker see three ... or\nA that would be an a machine that can do everything a person could do it's creative they can teach itself new things and we don't\nWe don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or it is a computer program that can do one thing very well they can identify spam email it can route you through traffic\nAnd now we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it and make projections about the future\nAnd that doesn't sound all that interesting but that's in a sense of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are faster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really look\nSmart um by just using these simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that were just ... us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see\nWe we all have some amount of privacy\nOr just based on the fact that there are so many of us can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools were developing to do very good thing it was like a dent of cancer or something like that\nCan be use to to to to follow people voice to the to text\nAnd it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading lip so every camera\nEven if it doesn't that audio can read lips as well as a human um your you know you have a a device that tracks where you are and again all of these things and of themselves aren't bad technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world\nUm you know China has implemented a kind of a social\nScore yeah that's right who\nRun run a red light you lose a pulley if you go do it in the government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and if you if you get a low enough you don't fly on airplanes anymore and you\nDon't um and and do you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't get any may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are\nA habit capability of of of being misused of course hopefully in in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a republic but there's governed by laws the price of liberty is a turtle vigilance and so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and enforced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is every tell them the telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even though Ninety nine percent of them were probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I I just couldn't say the technology is at a point where it could decipher you know what what what that many people are saying and then it can\nAh it doesn't have to understand it and the way the human understand something that just has to look for patterns and combinations of words along with some\nActions and and and just kind of building built abstract profiles on people I mean I'm I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to use this technology which can be to do so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand or a let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about bombing something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up code words like bomb terror or whatever\nAnd so it finds this uh on one hand\nIt's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy on the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian and Byron in terms of if it's OK or not\nWell\nIt is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have the suicidal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know federal is paper that addressed that topic uh and now that that's going to have to be a conversation that we have\nOver the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAlright well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called the fourth age we're talking to a lot of high technology folks and what it does his website is his name linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com we'll be back in the moment don't touch you\nNever missed a detail of the show or a

chemical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my part coast about a I I find maybe one person in twenty that doesn't believe that\nAnd yet when we take surveys on my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country\nDoesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe your machine because eventually we'll probably build a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are just machines then no bending machine can never through what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way it does just with chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of ...\nYeah it it's staggering but he really is\nUm ... the thing is is that when a computer can play chess someone to computer complete go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but\nBut there really is a quote anybody home there's nothing there but does any thinking at all it's it's one reason zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off\nOr at the speed of light um it's done with which relative it's interesting the techniques for use for an official intelligence we'd been writing about for\nForty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere is a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem and it's about it ... it goes like this there's this\nThere's this rumor or that's full of these books and there was a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Cheney is but people outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door\nTo this trying to display period the librarian picks up\nLooks at the first character and the question\nGoes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that sentence him to another book to another book to another book to another book\nUntil it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door and the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since this perfect\nAnd so the question is does the library and understand Chinese\nThose are those the library and understand Chinese ... to to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense to a lot of people\nKnow delivery and doesn't know if they're talking about color or coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because that's all the computer does it runs a set of determining stick\nProcesses in memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any what he's talking about it doesn't know anything and so you're kind of have to ask is the computer thinking or not there's a computer understand anything or not\nA by my way of looking at doesn't that doesn't understand anything but other people other people say if they can do everything that something that does understand can do then you just have to say it does\n[noise] in in is just mind boggling and it's getting even better or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers do this thing where in a very simple shorthand they double in power every couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's\nFifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can collect data there'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all those who may have all this data coming in and these faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it\nIf you think about it the Internet the mosaic browser came out twenty five years ago a literal you in in Ninety three\nAnd all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was that and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars in well a million new businesses it up in ... I mean it did everything that that imagine\nA technology that effectively makes everybody smarter than they were before you go to bed tonight everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points that is going to be more transformative than the ...\nThis this is machines think reason\nWill they show emotion Byron\nThat is an open question a it is even an open question whether you want them to\nI don't I'm not sure I Want them to\nSell the first question is do you want them to simulate emotion\nUh there there was a couple of different sides to that you know I have a ... device that I talked to and I interrupted and I tell it to stop in a way I wouldn't do a person\nUm you had you had students had kids in Japan and there was a a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother would beat it and the robot learned\nBenefits all bunch of short people kids without a tall person around an adult it needed a run off to a tall person because the kids what abuser now ... when I asked later the kids said\nThey thought it was feeling distrust so they even felt like it was internalized and get you wonder about\nAbout a kindergarten teacher you know that the robotic that\nUh the raising children on fake empathy you you you just start with that do you even want them to have human voices is that a noble the machine somehow or does\nYou know we've had the car away to these things called human rights a to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being\nAnd because there's something special about the human being\nAnd and do we kind of want to make things look like humans that we do abuse and throw into a scrap heap and and and destroy without a second thought what that is certainly having nothing effect on people now the question can they\nFeel emotion a that is an open question we\nWe have we have something called consciousness which is that we experience the world we feel warmth a computer measures temperature that difference whatever that is that you feel the warmth of something a computer right now we don't think\nOr can we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a person's screaming at the temperature gets over five hundred degrees nobody believes that computer\nFeels pain nobody believes that ... ... or ...\nNow the interesting thing is we wouldn't do it if I'm if they did really well you wouldn't know if a treat the pain and you share half your DNA with the with the tree you should know DNA with a computer and so we wouldn't really even know if they ever if they ever developed a emotions\nAnd even if they claimed that they did that could just be in a way a program running that\nYou know the the the program reasons that it can can achieve whatever objective it launched by making this claim I'm so\nIt it's an open question it it all boils down to do you think of motions in the end are mechanical I mean our our ... again it's a punchy back to the original question are we machines and therefore our experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nWhat happens in these machines Byron go rogue and they started doing things to us to screw up our lives on purpose\nWell\nI'm\nA little help from two thousand one space on\nIt's All right I mean look\n\nIt ever happened uh we're completely vulnerable of course you know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet you know smart other news just turn them all on and override their safety protocols I mean there are so many ways a malevolent machine would want to um\nThe the interesting and and so you kinda have to say what would that happen and it can happen in one or two scenarios either through careless programming machine just does it doesn't have any intent at all um\nOr kinda machine somehow develop goals of its own that are different than ours and perhaps in conflict with hours and ... and pursue those goals against those they're um\nThey're open questions I mean right now though\nIt doesn't feel like you know I ...

I think anything that multiplies human ability is you know we took a few exceptions the idea if you can make people more productive that's always good if you don't think it is when you should support a law\nThat makes everybody work with one arm tied behind their back because instantly you create tons of new jobs it'll just take a lot more people to do anything but our productivity will plummet and so that's what technology is just like a third arm it means you can do even more\nLet's take some calls here for us by Ron let's pick it up by going to Jeff in Tennessee welcome to the program they started hey Jeffrey go ahead\nHey I've taught and before I Love your show George thank you ... ... not once or twice and I've got some ... now and fire [laughter] and I and I tell you what played them back on the show\nI don't know what I'm saying that don't say that but what what's wrong tell me\nUm they say well now that added the fate of the jobs are being created the technology that taken out to the white\nWell Byron you're saying that it creates more jobs\nAll right I mean look at\nYou you can look at the unemployment numbers in this country are you know good I mean they're they're down a there are some people who say the workforce participation rate is lower which are the number of people who actually are looking for work I'm almost all of that can be accounted for by a baby boomers retiring\nI'm ...\n... you know technology\nAlways empowers people to be able to do more there's there's kind of like an infinite number of jobs you you can make a job instantly the minute you take something a ...\nAnd you apply labor and technology to it and you make something worth more of age and whatever value you were able to add that to wage\nAnd [noise] because technology lets you do more technology increases wages\nIt it's really rough when it when it happens in a localized area and\nAh so you you get pockets of places where it takes a long time for it to kind of shake out and and that's rough and I think we should do a much better job kind of facilitating that up because you know you can say well it's all going to work out in the long run but people live in the short run\nAnd and that's that's hard and and so we we got to be very mindful of that or we trained people the kinds of safety nets we we provide but to turn against technology to say\nSomehow knowing how to be more productive is bad for for people uh I think it's a hard case to make\nNo I'm opposed to and I've said this before driverless trucks I don't want to displace truck drivers or they're hardworking dedicated people and I don't trust the driverless truck I just know what do you think of that\nUm I think that's one of the biggest kind of miss that a\nIs there is going to be a huge uh\nWithout kind of without saying first of all they're kind of facing a demographic disaster that every year the average age of all the truck drivers is going up\nBecause everybody's like you know young people don't go into it because everybody's like there's a future in that because of self driving trucks so most knowledgeable people in the industry are predicting we're gonna have this this great shortage of them\nAnd even when we get over the technological hurdles then when we get over the legislative hurdles they they still were only going to be able to do part of of the hall\nI Want to see a driverless truck jeeze put it in Los Angeles traffic going crazy [laughter]\n[laughter] well I agree there's a long way for the technology to go it's interesting that thousands of people die in car accidents and president but if there's one accident with a driverless car makes\nIt's a huge anyway and in in ... Arizona driverless car kill the woman\n... couple of months that makes the news which you know and ... and other people that die in car accidents don't hung on to another thing to look at something happens to be\nAt least ten times better maybe a hundred times better than humans before people would accept it it's got to be so overwhelming that you say uh you know we've got to outlaw people driving because people are just unreliable they're awful\nIs there anything about the AI that you don't like\nNo I mean certainly put simply put if they are effectively makes people smarter\nThan to say that's bad is to argue for ignorance to say while it would be better if if we all woke up within fewer IQ points tomorrow\nI says what study data about the past and use it to project into the future that's the collective memory for the planet for ten thousand years on this planet people learn something\nA bigger it all out and then they die and its forgotten or maybe they caught somebody and they messed it up now all of a sudden your life experience of my life experience but come the data to make somebody else's life better in the future and so no no the technology to say artificial intelligence is bad would be to say intelligence is somehow bad\nWe've got you on Long Island New York now Hi Joe go ahead\nFire and a couple of questions one with the corporate level you look at Eastman Kodak is competitive GM and Eastman Kodak really doesn't exist and they were you know that high a B. twelve years ago and uh you know a lot of good research and uh\nThey didn't hold on\nA so some of the corporate level I think they they may have to have made some missteps\nAnd then uh if you look at throngs I think uh there's\nAn obvious potential for chaos with them drones flying around you're trying to walk down the block and a drone flying at you or are they can be weaponized than and flowing into a a a ballpark why game and San\nSo that's another thing and finally just walking around the mall we I was thinking about that movie late do save either where the guy with\nThe star was working on the beach and they had the boy helping them one of those papers and\nYou know if it's really a reason to be at an office most of the time and truck to an office one when he could just get on the computer and do the work or on a beach [noise]\n[noise] wow that's great stuff I'd like to I'd like to talk to all three of those things um because the first one you know you mentioned corporations and he's been ...\nIt's very interesting to me the large companies don't usually make leaps and the of the original doll companies uh I used to say only ones left and then it was just\nOriginally the big powerhouses or they're\nKnow sometimes a new technology comes along and they just don't adopt a blockbuster you know a streaming video came along and they were like yeah we'll we'll just wait and see and you mentioned them and I'm\nA Polaroid the same story which was digital photography and they didn't they didn't catch on right blockbuster was another one\nExactly with regard to drones I agree with you we're we're going to have to work that out and you know where where in search early days but uh but you know there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like\nCustoms are gonna be laws there's going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't have because that's a very real working remote\nYou know I I kind of\nHope so I I don't know that I Would tell you a blanket thing for for every single person on the planet like\nBecause you can just list our careers that you you can't like the electrician or a ballet dancer or anything that requires a psychiatrist or anything to record a are kindergarten teacher requires you to be president in any in any way\nBut for people who are the information industry then yeah it was just there was a series of commercials on I don't know if you remember the nineties that someday you will you know send a fax from the beach someday you will and all of the things in those commercials kind of thing they\nDid really stay with us by run you're going to come back and take some calls in a final chat next on coast to coast they in\nThe coast website is now streamline for mobile devices and great news if your coast insider who simply want to enjoy our website on your boon visit coast to coast am dot com on your iPhone or Android browsers\nSomething amazing which we will taste why my Hot X and contract\nStaggering it that it's one thing that you can check out on top\nOf the kind of sweet ... results coming target [noise] like it kinda barbaric ... actually well I thought I had works beautifully owner\nRichard Haass so here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system which has hailed this gentleman's hot\nThe immune system can be called one of the bodies fears this powers to he'll visit C.

me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that that the world of robots is going to take over the planet take you take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people jobs\nBut um other tests to my website you take to try to figure out if it's your job is at risk and it it records all the answers and very very few jobs actually cut a robot\nTakeover I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or any of the thousands of other things people do and and I'm not\nA so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase in productivity and we we're all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence ... exactly what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[laughter] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex and you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what they what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing in common\nSo they either me or what did you see in the movies\nSo commander data upstart trucker see three radio or\nA that would be an a machine that can do everything a person could do it created it can teach itself new things\nAnd we don't we don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build bath and that's called a general intelligence or it is a computer program that can do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic\nAnd now we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it and make projections about the future\nAnd that doesn't sound all that interesting but that said in a sense of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are faster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things to really look\nSmart um by just using these simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that were just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see\nWe we used to all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many of us can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools were developing to do very good things\nThat can be used to to to to follow people voice that protects so now a every phone conversation can be recorded\nAnd it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading lips so every camera even if it doesn't that audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device that tracks where you are and again all of these things ended up themselves aren't bad technologies but they certainly can be used an aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world\nUm you know China has implemented a kind of a social\nScore yeah that's right who\nWrite run a red light you lose a polling if you go to an end to government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and uh if you if you get low enough you don't fly on airplanes anymore and you don't um\nAnd and do you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't get\nAny may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are a habit capability of of of being misused of course hopefully in in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a republic is governed by laws\nThe price of liberty is a turtle vigilance and so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and enforced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is every tell them the telephone conversations smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even though in Ninety nine percent of them were probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know\nI don't know but I I just couldn't say the technology is at a point where it could decipher you know what would put that many people are saying and then it can\nAh it doesn't have to understand it and the way the human understand something that decides to look for patterns and combinations of words along with some\nActions and and and just kind of build up the abstract profiles on people I mean I'm I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to use this technology which can be to do so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand or a let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about bombing something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up code words like bomb terror or whatever\nAnd so it finds this uh on one hand it's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy\nOn the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian and Byron in terms of if it's OK or not\nWell it is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have the suicide of consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know\nFederal is paper that addressed that topic uh and now that that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAll right we'll stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Rand Reese with us his book is called the fourth age we're talking to a lot of high technology folks and what it

point in the future we can build a new chemical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my part about it I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country\nDoesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build a I'm a mechanical ... if you don't think human beings are just machines then no vending machine could never do what a person can do\nHow did they make artificial intelligence work the way it does just what\nTo me it's amazing that they can put this kind of brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering there really is\nThe thing is is that when a computer can play chess someone to computer complete go and one of the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really is a quote anybody home there's nothing there\nBut does any thinking at all it's it's one lives in zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off\nOr at the speed of light um it's done with which relative it's interesting the techniques for use foreign official intelligence we'd been writing about for\nForty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere is a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem and it's about it it goes like this there's this\nThere's this room that's full of these books and there was a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Cheney is the people outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door\nTo this Chinese ... librarian the librarian picks them up\nLooks at the first character and the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that sentence him to another book to another book to another book to another book until it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door and the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since perfect and so the question is does\nThe librarian understand Chinese\nAs those the library and understand Chinese ... to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense to a lot of people\nKnow delivery and doesn't know if they're talking about color or coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because that's all the computer does it runs a set of the term in his ...\nProcesses in memory it spits out of answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any what is talking about it doesn't know anything\nAnd so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not there's a computer understand anything or not or by my way of looking at doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people other people say if they can do everything that that's something that does understand can do then you just have to say it dies\nIn is just mind boggling and it's getting even better or is it not the technology every year\nComputers do this thing where it\nIn a very simple shorter and they double in power\nEvery couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's Fifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can collect data\nThere'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all of those they have all this data coming in and these faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it\nIf you think about it the Internet the mosaic browser came out twenty five years ago a literal you in in Ninety three\nAnd all they did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars in well a million new businesses it up in ...
