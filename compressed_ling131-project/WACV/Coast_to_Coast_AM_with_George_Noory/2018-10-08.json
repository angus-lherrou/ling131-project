to be\nA very successful man a ... had a wife that everybody loves headed nice big house but it didn't change is infatuation with the dog\nI mean are you might think back when you were a kid maybe

in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean how little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room\nSo are his room was eventually moved to the attic at at the wife's insistence but you know they claim that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house in the house set their abandoned for quite a few years

me and my friends were just hanging out of there and then all of a sudden like this huge deep dark fog just swept in in the afternoon like we're watching the ... all of a sudden this super thick fog just said and\nThere were like six to eight what looked to be\nLike deep headlights off in the distance thought nothing of it about five to ten minutes later they started heading ride a bike right at us we've got to thinking about it we're at and overlook there was no way it could have been like jeeps or anything\nWe started watching them and like this belief at this point they get right upon us about two hundred feet away and then they dislike broke apart and just started like bugs and all around and we took off um come to find like for two years I thought I was crazy me and my two friends ... what was that\nWhat's going on out that way Josh\n... it was it was some wild stuff and then uh\nAbout a year or two later my my buddy send me a link it might have been from your website or something talking about it and uh it just like connected the dots I've I've been really trying to contact you but we're not trying but willing to talk to you that for about twelve years now to to see what you think about it\nWhat is that Josh well\nTyler thank you for that call always good to talk to a fellow Ashville yet another tar hill and um you know right in North Carolina you know everybody of course focuses on brown mountains or the brown mountain lights because the brown mountain lights are the most famous example\nYou talked about them before Josh\nYeah of of this strange phenomenon where you have these balls of light that appear but\nActually this is widespread this goes beyond brown mountain\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains and ah you know the which is of course the part of the Appalachian chain Lena leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where these balls of light appear\nNow I Believe that [noise]\nIf you if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain lights dot com\nBut basically an eye on that website but um but what I can tell you is that there are places on earth that produce an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy\nAs a byproduct a bunch of paranormal activity that spins off so you get more grossly encounters people seeing UFOs time slips scripted all that kind of stuff but in its role as form\nIt's almost like Meridian Z on planet earth that acupuncture is Mike compared to the ... of energy the flow on a human body these are places that conduct electricity and when that electricity manifest\nCertain cliffs it can create what similar to to ball whitening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy around west North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these ball the white are just merely and simply\nA raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or if they might also have some sense of intelligence and uh this is what makes this such a great mystery\nGosh where his website Joshua ...

Joshua ... warned our final segment next hour we'll talk about on to the world war two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us so Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you originally get started in paranormal investigating what was that one catalyst that got you into\nIt [noise] oddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born really um 'cause I I come from a large family uh my mother is the youngest of ten kids\nAnd my dad is one of seven kids while at both both sides of my family they been in the mountains of western North Carolina since the uh late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nUh but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family in the great depression or my mother's mother was named to Virginia Calloway that with her\nIs old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big bill back to her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything in the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties are named Claude\nCame home from a small game hunting trip and she photograph them a holding up their squirrels and rabbits and stuff and when the picture develop my great uncle clogged Calloway her older brother did not have a head\nAnd they they knew that was weird but they were not able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later a clause was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tails\nAnd uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing lunch and they were conversing through an open window and at some point or jak said something to clog called didn't answer\nAnd when the lunch was ready jak went outside and I'm here's clauses magazine lying on the porch but there's no call and I'm a long story short my great uncle called Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nShe uh David ... involved in the ...\nWell yeah well you know it's actually it's not too far from where there is a national um art these days you know the ... national park area and and and what's even weirder is that you know they I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods\nAnd I'm In a hearing this fellow my great uncle who was waiting for his lunch and I'm In the middle of a story\nAnd reading a magazine and how could he have disappeared was the abducted was the rapture the way that he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean we don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken\nOne month before and when I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened and I mean I verify the whole story with\nElderly people and ah historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was a big tragedy in my family ah they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound that this created\nAnd it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk pills I mean the the paranormal if you want to call it that there's something very real\nThat we have to take seriously and so that inspired me to go out and sort of tried to define fact ah versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was what I really started seeing some bizarre stuff uh for myself with my own two wives\nWho for you let's go to the final calls here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI I like earth is November you have to go ahead and I was wondering if you also said yes and how does that relate to how all souls day in Halloween\n[noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth my mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth and I can't tell you how many people and those who have birthdays around Halloween including doctor\nOh I Am and I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months it takes you kind of close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise]\nBut um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the basic tradition of Sao on which of course we now call Halloween\nIs built around October thirty first and this is the product of the Catholic Church\nComing into the pagan areas of Europe\nAnd trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan believes into Christianity\nWith their own date well November ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't they doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan and say instead of considering October thirty first\nUm some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback\nWhich would be November the first and so we will say November the first is the Halloween day and the evening before that is the hallowed with evening or Halloween [noise] and so\nThen uh they sort of combined the pagan beliefs of Halloween with all saints day on November first\nAnd then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate saints but just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day\nUm but this is one of those are interesting examples or it goes back to you know Christmas we're going to be hearing more stories about this soon uh probably is Christmas approaches where\nYou know the a lot of the patients will go out and worshipped trees you know the evergreen quality of trees and there was there was one of the um the higher ups in the Catholic Church is said look if we go out and we find a bunch of people who were worshipping a tree\nAnd we tell them you're all wrong and we cut the tree down and we punish them we're not going to win any friends instead let's go and sanctify the tree and and then what they are already worshipping will just sort of morph into our philosophy and so you see a similar\nFrom\nMaster control center

a Joshua I was a up on the blue ridge parkway about\nYeah and I spirit who crazy life um to make it to make a brief\nI was up a around like black ball some area me and my friends were just hanging out of there and then all of a sudden like this huge deep dark fog just swept in in the afternoon like we're watching the sun to all of a sudden it's super thick fog just said is\nThere were like six to eight what looked to be\nLike deep headlights off in the distance thought nothing of it about five to ten minutes later they started heading writer at like right after we got to thinking about it we're at and overlook there's no way it could have been like jeeps or anything\nWe started watching them and like this belief at this point they get right up on us about two hundred feet away and then they dislike broke apart and just started like bugs and all around and we took off\nUm come to find like for two years I thought I was crazy me and my two friends ... what was that what's going on out that way Josh ... it was it was some wild stuff and then uh about a year or two later my my buddy send me a link it might have been from your website or something talking about it\nAnd uh it just like connected the dots of I've been really trying to contact you but we're not trying but willing to talk to you for about twelve years now to to see what you think about it what is that Josh\nWell it's highly thank you for that call always good to talk to a fellow Ashville yet another tar hill and um you know right in North Carolina you know everybody of course focuses on brown mountains or the brown mountain lights because the brown mountain lights are the most famous examined\nYou talked about them before Josh\nOf of this strange phenomenon where you have these balls of life that appear but\nActually this is widespread this goes beyond brown mountain\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains and ah you know the which is of course a part of the Appalachian chain Lena leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where these balls of light appear\nNow I Believe that [noise]\nIf you if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain lights dot com\nBut basically an eye on that website but um but what I can tell you is that there are places on earth that produce an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy has as a byproduct a bunch of paranormal activity that spins off so you get more grossly encounters people seeing UFOs time slips scripted all that kind of stuff but in its role as form\nIt's almost like Meridian Z on planet earth that acupuncture is Mike compared to the ... of energy that flow on a human body these are places that conduct electricity and when that electricity manifest and\nInteracts at in certain angles at certain cliffs it can create what similar to to ball lightening and so you have so much of that which is creepy around western North Carolina but at the same time it almost\nSeems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these balls of white are just merely and simply\nA raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning orders\nYeah and uh this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua his website Joshua ... worn dot com you've got the information coming up

... the war in our final segment next hour we'll talk about haunted World War two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us so Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you originally get started in paranormal investigating what was that one catalyst that got you into it\n[noise] oddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born really um 'cause I I come from a large family or my mother is the youngest of ten kids\nAnd my dad is one of seven kids while at both both sides of my family they been in the mountains of western North Carolina since the uh late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nUh but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family\nIn the great depression or my mother's mother was named to Virginia Calloway that was her maiden name and when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big bill back to her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything and the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties are named Claude came home from a small game hunting trip and she photographed them a whole ...\nMy great uncle called Calloway her older brother did not have a head and they they knew that was weird but they were not able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later a clause was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tails\nAnd uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing lunch\nAnd they were conversing through an open window and at some point or jak said something to clog called didn't answer\nAnd when the lunch was ready jak went outside and I'm here's clause magazine lying on the porch but there's no call and I'm a long story short my great uncle called Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nShe uh David ... involved in the ...\nWell yeah well you know it's actually it's not too far from where there is a national um art these days you know the ... national park area and and and what's even weirder is that you know I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods and\nI'm In a hearing this fellow my great uncle was waiting for his lunch\nAnd I'm In the middle of a story and reading a magazine ... how\nCould he had disappeared was he abducted was the rapture way did he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean we don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken\nOne month before and when I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened in I mean I've verify the whole story with\nElderly people and a historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was a big tragedy in my family or they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound that this created\nAnd it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk tales I mean the the paranormal if you want to call it that\nThere's something very real that we have to take seriously and so that inspired me to go out and sort of try to define fact ah versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was what I really started seeing some bizarre stuff for myself with my own two wives\nWho for you let's go to the final calls here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI I like the earth is November ... go ahead and I was wondering if I Will also said yes and how does that relate to how all souls day in Halloween\nYeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth\nMy mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth and I can't tell you how many people in who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months that takes you kinda close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise]\nBut um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the the basic tradition of Sao on which of course we now call Halloween\nFirst and this is the product of the Catholic Church coming into the pagan areas of Europe and trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan beliefs into Christianity\nWith their own date well ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan and say instead of considering October thirty first\nUm some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback\nWhich would be November the first and so we will say November the first is the Halloween day\nAnd the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween [noise]\nAnd so then uh they sort of combined the pagan believes of Halloween with all saints day on November first and then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate saints but just celebrate all the soles\nPeople who have died and so you end up with all souls day uh but this is one of those are interesting examples or it goes back to you know Christmas we're going to be hearing more stories about this soon uh probably is Christmas approaches where\nYou know the a lot of the patients will go out and worship trees you know the evergreen quality of trees and there was there was one of the um the higher ups in the Catholic Church is said look if we go out and we find a bunch of people who are worshipping a tree\nAnd we tell them you're all wrong and we cut the tree down and we punish them we're not going to win any friends instead let's go and sanctify the tree and and then what they are already worshipping will just sort of morphed into our philosophy and so you see a similar", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Coosada",
