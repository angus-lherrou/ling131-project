I wrote a book about the twilight zone and the subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling used to write most of his shows by dictating in a Dictaphone while he was floating in this pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word um I don't know if he did most of them in the pool and the pool but he's certainly dictated most of his scripts and\nAnd us I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed or he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nSo let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nOnly show was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um you know he was had the patriotic fervor or you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part I'm so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could\nAnd he had this um this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper aid that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was assigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne\nAnd he saw some pretty heavy combat and and the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's got 'em for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality to them and did he get that from his combat oh ... ethics yeah he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several times a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the toilets\nPart of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of twilight zone episodes particularly one called the purple testament which is actually in lady um during World War two so that was as close as he got to literally revisiting his his combat experience in the twilight zone and then several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in that golden age of television was any\nYes he uh he certainly was it was a time when television was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up\nAnd television needed writers I was it was it was this fast you know I always say vast wasteland it was a vast medium that was just\nDevoid of talent at the time and rod you know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much that he just sent stuff out and stuff out until finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know he shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk to Scott Carol Serling rods wife\nI did not unfortunately now is he would've had a a tree with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah now with with rod\nHe started before you got in the twilight zone and he was a writer for other kinds of shows was any\nOh sure sure there are some people may not know this but rod Serling was\nWithout question the most prestigious writer in television before the toilet so he had written you know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six and fifty seven a twilight zone started and fifty nine I'm so he was at the top of the of the heap uh before the twilight zone came out\nAnd he just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama sensibility into the twilight zone and gave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times what he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to critique him editorialize and even controlling\n[noise] yeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that certainly ran into was that he believe that it's a writer's job to do those things that the ... job to address the issues of his time\nAnd every time he tried to address any issue of any social import on television the censors would get his way of the sponsors would get in this way and he it was frustrating for him and\nThankfully for ... for rod he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction\nHe loved fantasy science fiction horror you know all that kind of thing so he created the twilight zone because he always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff\nBy if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less a controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show where the cool ending it had a message to\nEl absolutely if it was a a television series that just had a cool a twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know ... it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that\nUm because he again believe that that was part of the artist job the art if it's going to be art it has to what he would say that has to say something about something and you know it has to be entertaining he did wants to entertain but at the same time he had to say something about something what\nDo you think some of the ... that he wanted\nAround his career of the big the biggest issue was prejudice um rot had this this innate aversion to prejudice and he believed it was ... I Believe that all evils stemmed from prejudice that that's the beginning and that's the root of all of them so he wanted to address that idea\nThat um we have this um this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own faults and we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\nHe has some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about six years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine\nAnd yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released I'm a science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred\nTelevision series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction as old TV series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one who made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting any Matty black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone is it's entered the consciousness just as a term you know people know that the twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is off kilter if something is strange something is not quite right\nAnd it lasted all this time because of of routes messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so well produced so well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from point a to point the you know so so that's I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and I it's a Bradbury had heard about it\nAnd I had written an article about it in a what we had what's called the after dark newsletter and the bread very just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about ... by shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got\nAnd that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office uh what rod didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no no listen nobody could write every script you know a rod wrote Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over five seed that's pretty prolific that is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five season periods just\nIf you know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced is just\nIs just off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty nine Nineteen Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted he was just addicted to it maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah and absolutely had heart issues and that's what's on the demand you said that Ronda wrote the wool over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he were Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty other ... the total shows that's crazy isn't it\nIt it really is you know when I was researching the book it it's\nYou know there's a couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well first of all yeah you're on Ninety two twilight zone episodes he also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories about how the so if you know they do is that's\nA hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides that's why it's on the night gallery\nWe'll take phone calls with a buddy

badly [laughter] your voice has not changed all that much still waiting for puberty the strike was\nIt really you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and then I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lowly ana for it still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got sick notches on my belt when it comes to the tea zone\nAnd when you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod Serling around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when they did is you know bumpers intros and uh [noise]\nYeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast\nOn the twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer book out and we're really seeing kilo the in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled\nControl from network hassling as much as they could\nUh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see a Mr certainly when he was on the set and talk to them about what was coming up in the next episode her so usually when an executive producer or creator comes on and it was said and they were but he gets a little uptight yeah though that you know or when Alan's here [laughter]\nOr whatever but I recall quite clearly that a rod Serling was on the city everybody was delighted to be around to\nTalk with you yeah yeah sure we went out for margaritas every night and you know that's right and how old were you you're a little kid\nI was six uh six and seven and\nNine that somehow didn't they find you believe in these parts\n[noise] um well actually one of the very first lead roles I did was a an episode of uh Loretta Young show that was directed by James Sheldon the chorus Leishman played by mom and a\nAnd the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me in for a long distance call and he also directed it's a good life\nSo having to under my belt or I guess they just you know just called me up for embrace it passed\nA busy guy and they were you were in ... now what are you doing these days really what's new\nWell Angela car right now I'm just released aren't novel a fantasy novel I think we talked about it when we were first riding on the time and go charge on purpose it's called the devil recruiter and chicken and all around this area has weapons\nLow you set yourself with some uh for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm you know thrown ancient aliens and you know I'm playing the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise] making music to\nYou than us capability thinks that's it you got it by George Bailey movie isn't that a treat Nick ... I was thinking George so that was great he was a again rod Serling for you on this show you never know [laughter] yeah you might call in from the from the other side what inspired you to read the book about certainly\nWell I mean I became a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know mesmerized by the show and and so that started everything\nAnd then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he had written a you know so much of it that was great\nAnd I I just wanted to collect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually\nI'm done this type of thing where for example you know there wasn't even really a complete\nCertainly wrote that were produced TV or or or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ever had yeah gas whatever but so that had never been done so the first thing I wanted to do is I Want to know exactly what he wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so\nAnd then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that\nYou know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been haven't been commercially released\nUm I wanted to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about so you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography and this part\nYou know critical analysis of the the themes certainly was was dealing with an a character types that he you know that he researched and you know built into and et cetera\nDid you come across anything that surprised you and your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm\nProbably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against throwing whenever he tried to do anything that was remotely controversial whether there's one show that's particularly infamous in that regard it's called it's called noon on doomsday\nIt was rod Serling attempt to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know Emmett Till's a fourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman\nAnd this really just\nDestroyed rod Serling he wants to sell\nSome version of the story and Everytime he tried to he you know he met resistance well I was able to find the ... the actual first draft of this script that rod wrote before\nAny of these um you know any of these into a interference is came into play and there have been several studies of this particular show in the evolution that it's so from from you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on TV [laughter] well but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily\nFound the actual first draft and that surprised me because I'll I'll spoil it for you know it's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that\nNoon on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect the rod Serling\nIt uh it devastated and he was um [noise] you know superficially he was a Kennedy admirer he was he agreed with his politics and he\nHe's mark Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I came across a letter that rotted written to um\nTo his ... pastor but he was a Unitarian or for most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling wasn't he wrote a letter to one of his Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just kind of it just took away his faith in humanity\nThat something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so\nIt really it just yeah it it it throw him for it threw him into a dark place for a little while\nAnd strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination he and William fruit that one of the producers on this while its own were contacted by the state department\nAnd ask to produce a film to introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world while it was a documented they needed a documentary they thought you know listen we got to get something quick that we can just send to our ally\nHere's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the assassination when he was you know depressed for sure flew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that he finished\nYeah in fact the you know the uh\nThe the people who asked him to do this I said we ... we need this in five days and and and William fruit said listen that's not going to happen we we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we said before Roger so prolific and he was so such a fast writer he did get through it pretty quickly and they had they had it ready\nYou know I I actually don't do exactly the timeframe wasn't five days but it wasn't much much longer than that\nWhat is it about black and white TV shows that have a different feel than the color shows that we all see nowadays yeah\nYou know it's [noise] well I can tell you specifically when it comes to the twilight zone I think that's one of the things that\nKilling five Seventy two hundred gift certificates are always available William Mason salon innovative concept salon and the ... town center called delayed by Seventy two hundred for an appointment or visit on the Web\nAt William Mason salon dot map\n[noise]\nChevrolet Master control so this is W.

wildfire\nWhen it got the car all I said ... what is it\nThat my table he goes yeah you were the story [laughter] it was a story and it turned out to be a an Eighteen century Philadelphia accordion table and I saw that a couple of weeks later for twenty five thousand or you\nMay Seventeen granted a couple of weeks\nAnd member that's back when Seventeen granted made was everything yeah oh my God me off at a business\nThat is something now did you luck out or did you know something\nThat I knew something and I asked the right questions for instance you know\nA lot the wood itself if the wood is that beautiful that's a that's a clue right there that it it's an indication that the peace could be right so you know I I use various commonsense clues I wasn't really great knowledge back then but I was not to get little lucky [laughter]\nHow many people Wayne have things collectibles antiques around the house and they have no idea that they're valuable\nYou know almost every single house I get into I find that treasure almost every single one and it could be anything right\nIt could be anything because you know an antique cars anything that made a difference in its day Nineteen fifty nine Barbie dolls somebody figured out in the fifty nine that a baby dolls and they have to be a baby\nYeah six thousand bucks jeez in pristine condition I guess that's what I look for\nCorrect day like great condition\nGosh I used to have a I had everything\nIn those days you remember those little monsters that marvel the company put out yeah there are\nThose are ah you don't even see those anymore they all got chewed up\n[laughter] yeah they did I bet they were worth something\nAlways playing golf with a guy when I first got started in the business worked at marvel and this was when this first Superman Movie came out and that was making some money for DC and he was uh\nCompany nobody reads comic books anymore and their business wasn't worth a darn I see a crazy one of these days people start taking your character's make movies when they do it's going to change your world\nI'll write you were\n[laughter] well marvel marvel comics were always everybody's favorite aren't they\nAll my gosh I just I just had one that was from Nineteen sixty three a Superman comic book that I said to my son to keep and I think it's worth four hundred dollars already\nOutrageous it's crazy yeah it costs to die in Nineteen sixty three when\nUh I Believe that's on Spider Man came out\nAnd that Spider Man comic books were I mean yeah on a grander more\nTime changes not that long ago no time changes things though Wayne doesn't yeah it\nDoes in one of the things that may get more popular obviously has some good movies\nYou know what I was thinking about the like seniors they declared bankruptcy also look at the last couple of days and I mean here's an institution that is like to me an antique because you know hundreds and we're seeing\nRight for fifty years yeah everything right\nAnd then all of a sudden bang Amazon comes along the Internet comes along and a white smoke\nYeah well you know today it's an awful lot like when they first started\nThe car business up you know a hundred plus years ago right it\nPut everybody who is in the horse business out of work that's right a lot of people lost their jobs and they thought it was the end of the world well computers are doing that today to us and it's going to take some time to adapt but it's going to make us all happier and richer and healthier\nBut I think so too I think so too are after the break let's talk about antiques and ghosts and some of the things that you've come across what would you say is the most bizarre thing that you've come across that we can say on the radio that ah you found it a house or something like that\nA boy that's a that's a tough one um\nI mean just all your head thing shrunken heads yeah real shrunken heads shrunken head oh my God\nYeah and I tell you what it had to ... I'm going to give you I Want to I Want to answer with two answers but the the the fake shrunken heads what they there by the way of shrunken has worked a fortune\nAlright and really come from the islands and stuff where this was medicine to people okay this was you know part of their culture\nAnd at what it was a very small culture so these are very rare\nI Hope they did with those who died rather than kill someone to do it\nUm I don't know I think I have to think about that but ah my hand handle one of those years ago and you know it wasn't a monkey had it was something a little strange and others learn how small are either very small about the size of a softball how do they do that\nI had no idea if I could answer that correctly I don't think you'd want to know me anymore would ya [laughter]\nThat's true they do it with a bomb on them down and not different types of medicinal spirits and also little magic number everybody has a magic and our culture now the other thing that I found that\nI found a pre Columbian pottery all and you're going to love this [laughter]\nThis is named by Native Americans in the ... the Pueblo people believe that a great race of aliens live there and those well blows before they lived there uh-huh taught their ancestors I'm\nAn awful lot about the world and are you aware of those those cultural ... yes okay sure you would be\nI'm In which means again it was made before Columbus came to the ... world pre Columbian figure of a a little person\nNow the the the dolls or the figures that they made their heads look just like what we consider a gray the alien grace lazy ... their faces look exactly like a gray with just a little bit spooky when you consider that\nThey'd had not had the stories about grace back then but that's the way all their little figures luck\nBut this one the person is actually talking on a communicator looks like wild and it's absolutely legitimate and I had somebody in my view out this morning or I'll say yesterday now um who is a clear point person my wife found that out but um [noise]\nI showed her that right\nShe said wing that is on me I have never felt more energy coming out of anything the antics of energy to especially the people who know energy she said that has so much energy it actually buses\nLoses a replica of something they saw back way before the Columbus era and something\nThat the Native Americans made they saw big here that looks like an alien bill and they actually talking now there have been a bunch of these would have been found and they're they're pretty interesting alone and they all look to sing like he's actually talking on a communicator that's weird I'm going to send you a picture\nThat you're gonna love this idea most will put it up on our website but that is something else\nAnd I tell you what your older your hands and I tell you it gives you is it [noise]\nWell you can feel something new apps are any everybody who's ever had put in an jot I'd love to see that and then the industry for fourteen Ninety two for fourteen Ninety two Jesus so channels absolutely no possibility that let's say a\nFake or anything it's the real McCoy and to me and stuff you find that when that\nAnd to me they saw some creatures that look like that and they made them they depicted them\nYeah I I think this is a depiction of The Elders that taught them their culture who came down to\nBelieve that people from us stars were there before them I Believe this is a a depiction of one of the star people\nThat could be the greatest proof we've been looking for you know what absolutely\nOrange do with this morning we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk about some of the haunted things that he stumbled across water ghosts attach themselves to some of these objects as well Wayne's website antique talk dot com is linked up at Costco stadium dot com\nAnd uh go ahead and take a look at his website it's just amazing we'll take calls next hour by the way\nAbout all the things we talked about already\nJoined the coast to coast ...

D. V. copies of this ... type and pass them around from city to city to city\nAll right and this book has a picture of Craig's\nUm embroiled type and the paper copies that they made of this this this these three children that they passed around from city to city to city bench surely up and not botched than a woman says those are my three sons children\nWhile those to my husband right before Gettysburg I haven't heard from since\nI'm Sorry he died they go on and tell her the story that spooky enough but then Craig says Wayne scoping your addict can scrounge around ... takes this is right after he gave me this book\nGo up my addict I live in Eighteen forty house has few spokes of its own right\nGo up and is Sadek and there's this little room where there was furniture assembled ... bought the house ceilings are only about four foot tall it's a spooky little room it's almost like Anne Frank and her family lived and there were a bunch of artifacts left over in the house when it was purchased\nOne of the things that was left over in the house was this book\n... book of photographs\nOf Craig and I opened it up and there is one of the C. D. V. copies\nImmediately there's those three kids there aren't right at us we dropped the\nBook industry [laughter]\nI mean that's what kind of coincidences at right now it's almost like that conjured up something pretty doggone spooky\nI guess you got to be careful with what you do\nWell you know I don't think careful I think that the positive things about antiques as they bring about good spirits a lot of happiness but there are times when you got to be a little bit careful I knew the warns pretty well and they are used to say don't play around with we gee boards and style by\nI Believe that\nYeah yeah I don't mess around with really chilly and takes but because you know he didn't want to open up doors you can't close right [laughter]\nThat's true that is absolutely true when when you do your room a gene and you've been to some of these older places and you find some of these things have you found objects that look scary to you\nAll the time it's often um the the things that that make them look scary is the houses that are in\nUm [noise] I was in a house where this famous psychologist or\nI died the story was that he killed themself and uh I go through there with my buddy a another buddy of mine who were doing a kind of a an appraisal of this this for a for some lawyers and\nAnd and we're taking photographs of these pieces and this guy had spray painted things on the walls that were really strange he was a LSD person\nAnd the house was filled with all sorts of strange uh furniture from the mission period nuts and had been cleaned\nAnd years and he had like\nCaptured animals and skin them and made things out of them um that was pretty scary when you're the first one to come across these things over the years and that that tends to make all the objects in the house all the scarier [laughter]\nSo I'm going through this house taking photographs of all the strange things right my body won't go up in the ... I Know what's wrong with you\nBecause why and there's something wrong up there\nWhat do you talk about it because I saw something up there I saw goes up there\nI said come on man we're working here right it's not time for this right we've got a lot to do he would not go up in the addict by himself grown man\nWe ended up going up in the addict together finishing photography up there and went downstairs took some more photographs [noise] All right I developed I I\nHad the photographs developed this was just actually no it was a it these were ah this was just the beginning when photographs were a digital but\nThe photographs in the attic all had these weird circles and I'm like ... like blooms every single photograph in that house had these these weird or send them\nNone of the photographs before we went up and he had a cat that so I figured I'd spent water on the lens I looked at the photographs or taken after we left the addict downstairs again no problem\nJust up and that strange addict that's where my buddy says that's what I saw\nVery strange do you find that the older the objects the more possible that it could be a haunted object\nYeah I think that um age has an awful lot to do with that\nFor stories to become attached to an object you know sometimes an object dies made and you know it's a table that was made back in ah\nA best selling professional grade driller ... thriller today for the big thick selection in the river Reagan Airport thriller Brazil's services to visit her ... thriller today on the cell by way or goal to eight eight fifty seven eighty five make your trailer come to light that airport trailer\nFrom\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center says is W.

dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word\nUm I don't know if he did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly dictated most description and us I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly was a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nSo let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation\nSo he was um you know he was had the patriotic fervor or you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part I'm so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could\nAnd he had this um this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper aid that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was assigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne\nAnd he saw some pretty heavy combat and and the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's called them for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality to them and did he get that from his combat oh ... ethics yeah he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several times a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the twilight zone so [noise] um it was always there was always part of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of twilight zone episodes\nUm during World War two so that was as close to the guts literally revisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and in several other other shows like I said before and after the while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in the golden age of television was any\n[noise] yes he uh he certainly was it was a time when television was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up\nAnd television needed writer so I was it was it was this fast you know I Would say vast we find it was a vast medium that was just\nDevoid of talent at the time and rod you know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much that he just sent stuff out and stuff out until finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know his shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk to Scott Carol ... rods wife\nI did not unfortunately no no the way to hit a tree with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah\nNow with with rod he started before he got in the twilight zone use a writer for other kinds of shows so is any\nOh sure sure they're out so I mean some people may not know this but rod Serling was\nWithout question the most prestigious writer in television before that is well it's all he had written you know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six and fifty seven a twilight zone started and fifty nine\nI'm so he was you know at the top of the of the heap or before the twilight zone came out and he just kind of took that for ... you know just straight for drama\nSensibility into the twilight zone and gave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times what he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to ah critique him editorialize and even controlling\n[noise] yeah yeah that was that was the big\nYou know the big problem that certainly ran into was that he believed that it's a writer's job to do those things that the writer job to address the issues of his time\nAnd every time he tried to address any issue of any social import on television the censors would get this way the sponsors would get in this way and it was frustrating for him and\nThankfully for ... for rod he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction he loves fantasy science fiction horror\nYou know all that kind of thing so he created the twilight zone because he's always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it\nAnd say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff\nBy if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show where the cool ending it had a message to\nEl absolutely if it was a TV series it just had a cool twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know it it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that\nUm because he again believe that that was part of the artist job the art if it's going to be art it has to he would he would say that has to say something about something and you know it has to be entertaining he did wants to entertain but at the same time he had to say something about something\nWhat do you think some of the ... that he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career the big the big ...\nInnate aversion to prejudice and he believed it was ... believe that all evils stem from prejudice that that's the beginning and that's the root of all them so he wanted to address that idea\nThat um we have this um this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own faults and we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\nHe has some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about six years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine\nAnd yeah it is you know\nI just recently there was a magazine was released I'm a science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred television series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction as a whole television series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one that made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting a Matty black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone is it's entered the consciousness\nJust as a term you know people know that\nThe twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is off kilter something is strange something is not quite right\nAnd it lasted all this time because of of rods messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so well produced so well acted a it was just the first class production from from get from point a to point the you know so\nSo that's I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and I it's a Bradbury had heard about it\nAnd I had written an article about it in a what we have what's called the after dark newsletter\nAnd the bread very just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about ... by shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got\nAnd that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office uh what rod didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but you didn't write he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no no listen nobody could write every script um you know a rod wrote Ninety two hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over five see that's pretty prolific\nThat is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five season period it's just it's you know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced is just is just off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty Nineteen Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted he was just addicted to it maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah and absolutely had heart issues and that's what finally a demand you said that brought the ... the well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he were Ninety two twilight zones than two hundred and fifty other the total shows that's crazy isn't it\nIt really is you know when I was researching the book it it's you know there's a couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well first of all yeah you're on Ninety two twilight zone episodes he also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories ha ha to social thing I Do is that's\nA hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides that's why it's on the night gallery\nOr next hour we'll take phone calls with\nA buddy about the twilight zone at the ... with us his book is

Browser to goes to goes damn dot com and enjoy\n[laughter] okay you give us the bad bad man oh I'm working for you now okay yeah I just need to tell you something buddy you're a bad man you're very badly [laughter]\nYour voice has not changed all that much bill you really have\nIs still waiting for puberty the strike what can I say\nIf you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and and I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lowly ana for it still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got six notches on my belt when it comes to the tea zone and\nWhen you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod Serling around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when they did is you know bumpers and intros and uh [noise]\nYeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast\nOn a twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer book out and we're really seeing kilo the in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled\nControl from network hassling as much as they could\nUh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see a Mr Serling when he was on the set and talk to them about what was coming up in the next episode or so usually one and executive producer or creator comes onto was said and they were but it gets a little uptight yeah though that you know or when Alan's here [laughter]\nOr whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that a rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around to\nTalk with you yeah yeah sure we went out for margaritas every night and you know that's right and well how old were you you're a little kid\nI was six uh six and seven and nine\n... how did they find you believe in these parts [noise]\nUm well actually the one of the very first lead roles like it was a an episode of uh Loretta Young show that was directed by James Sheldon the corps Leishman played by mom and a\nAnd the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me in for a long distance call and he also directed it's a good life\nSo having to under my belt or I guess they just you know just called me up for in praise of pets\nAre busy guy and they were you were in ... now what do you do in these days really what's new well Angela\nCar right now I'm just released are novel a fantasy novel I think we talked about it when we were first writing on him time and go charge on purpose it's called the devil recruiter and chicken and all that this area has weapons\nSlung you set yourself with some uh for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm married to a certain age and aliens and you know I'm playing the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise]\nMaking music to you this capability thinks that's it you got it by George Bailey movie isn't that a treat Nick\n... I was thinking George so that was great\nHe was a I get rod Serling for you on this show you never know\n[laughter] he might he might calling from the from the other side\nWhat inspired you to read the book about certainly\nWell I mean I became a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know mesmerized by the show and and so that started everything\nAnd then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he's written a you know so much of it that was great\nAnd I I just wanted to collect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually\nDone this type of thing where for example you know there wasn't even\nThe all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced TV or or or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ever had gaps whatever but so that had never been done so the first thing I wanted to do is I wanted to know exactly what she wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so\nAnd then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that\nYou know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been an Avon been commercially released\nUm I wanted to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about so you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography in this part\nYou know critical analysis of the the themes certainly was was dealing with the character types that he you know that he researched and you know built into et cetera\nDid you come across anything that surprised you and your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm\nProbably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that was remotely controversial whether there's one show that's particularly infamous in that regard it's called it's called noon on doomsday\nIt was certainly a tent to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until it's a\nFourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman and this really just\nDestroyed route certainly she wants to sell\nSome version of the story and Everytime he tried to he you know you have met resistance well I was able to find the ... the actual first draft of this script that rod wrote before\nAny of these um you know any of these him you know if the fear and says came into play and there have been several studies of this particular show in the evolution that it's so from from you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on TV [laughter] well but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily\nFound the actual first draft and that surprised me because I'll I'll spoil it for you know it's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that\nNew non doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect the rod Serling\nIt uh it devastated them he was um [noise] you know superficially he was a Kennedy admirer he was he agreed with his politics and he\nHe admired candidate but beyond that it was just it really you know I I came across a letter that rounded written to um\nTo his ... pastor but he was a Unitarian of most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling wasn't he wrote a letter to one of his Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just kind of it just took away his faith in humanity\nThat something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so it really it just yeah it it it throw him for it to them into a dark place for a little while\nAnd strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination he and William fruit that one of the producers on this while its own were contacted by the state department\nAnd ask to produce a film to introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world while it was a documentary they needed a documentary they thought you know listen we got to get something quick\nThe people so you know here's here's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the the assassination when he was you know depressed for sure flew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that he finished\nYeah in fact the you know the uh\nThe the people who asked him to do this I said we ... we need to spend five days and William fruit said listen that's not going to happen we can't we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we've said before Roger so prolific and he was so such a fast writer\nHe did get through a pretty quickly and they had they had it ready you know I I actually don't know exactly the timeframe wasn't five days but it wasn't much much longer than that\nWhat is it about black and white TV shows that have a different feel than the color shows that we all see nowadays yeah\nYou know it's [noise] well I can tell you specifically when it comes to the twilight zone I think that's one of the things that\nAd WWW dot capital city Ruben dot com capital city Ruben recapitalize Ruben industry ...\n\nRiverside several a master control center says is W.

back in a moment we'll talk more about rod Serling and take your calls next on coast to coast day um [noise]\nI cleared such a sweet to lovable animal and people would want to pet him and they come up and they get close to him and it would be instant my dad didn't\nWant to touch him like get the anti dog away from me even after we'd give her ... she would still stay very thinking bad bad bad gas I

Steiner\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York\nSkin so one would be the first one that seems like it was very escapist\nMore than maybe someone stay back in the success I'm just speculating as you had to write for a job and he came home and watch the twilight zone that would be almost like an escape from your daily reality\nAnd I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there any other shows really like that\nMy second question would be about the mysterious endings which I think a lot of that could be almost are not necessarily at the book could've unfolded into actual movies for the national scene [noise]\nUh where uh someone could take a twilight zone episode and kind of unfold and then to an actual movie you know like a planet of the apes\nYeah I I agree with you on that and and to get to the first question you know the yeah the escapist aspect that that's why I felt I mean that's I think that is part of all science fiction and fantasy of course is that that\nA scape is tone to it um but you know it's funny that you you mentioned that because that is actually something that rod Serling uh often pointed to about ... gallery I'm In the early seventies during the end of the Vietnam\nEra he felt that night gallery was giving people in the ... from the nightly news and seeing you know the stuff on you know stuff on the news about war and everything else that they go into the gallery an escape\nThrough that so he never really said that about the ... some but I think the similar a point can be made about the twilight zone as well\nAnd it is surprising that that that someone hasn't taken you know a twilight zone episode and expanded it into a feature film all those there's been there have been plenty of films that are certainly twilight zone in ... you know influenced that could very well just as just as well be twelve its own movies that aren't pulled the twilight zone\nWasn't Jack London on one of the twilight zones\nHe started for twilight zone yeah actually they actually start one with the movie um in praise of tip that's right yeah yeah and he was terrific guy jak club and probably gave my favorite performances on the twilight zone and and three of the episodes that he was he\nWas he a trumpet player in one of them\nExactly yes there's one called the passage for trumpet rod wrote that one and I'll tell you a quick story about that episode you know he the director\nUm jak caught me was so good in that episode is just so good that the director actually wrote or cold rod and said listen I don't want to take the camera off of this guy I just want to keep filming [laughter]\nYou'll have to go there any way we can make this into a two part episode he wanted to expand into an allergist because jak holding was so good and rod said you know we just can't be done with the budget we can't can't do more and a half an hour but that's that's saying something when the director says listen I'm just gonna let this guy going I'm just gonna film whatever does\nClassic classic classic Jason in Portland, Oregon is with us now Jason go ahead sir\nWell were you aware of that President they said why don't radios theater and they take some of the old episode when he ran for whom the radio and they also incorporate date things and have a\nCurrent topics like a just a couple of weeks ago I heard when they had to do with a nano by eating up um oil spill in the problem is that the reason that and I just thought that and thank you and I think with the ... they\nCool did you know about that Nick\nI I was not aware of the current uh uh uh current radio series no there actually was the twilight zone a series of radio dramas of the original episodes that was produced some uh not too long ago but no I wasn't aware of a of the current will know\nDidn't ... writes for radio in his early days\nSure yeah that's that's where he really got his start was in radio his first sales were to or where to a series called Grand Central station that air and I think on CBS um CBS\nCollege and so yeah that was that was the beginning before he broke and and actually the funny thing is he actually went back to radio and created a radio series in Nineteen fifty four so basically four years after he had broken into television he actually went back to work in Cincinnati and created this radio series called it happens to you\nAnd it was a series of Thirteen [noise] um original radio script\nWhere did he end up living Los Angeles\nA yes or well he once he lived in most in Pacific palisades for most of his professional career and then he always went back to a if a guy in upstate New York every summer and then he was teaching at all so we kind of gradually spent more time and it's like the later in life\nWhen he got sick was a long illness or did he go suddenly\nUm well it was it was pretty sudden he you know he had\n... years old was any or something\nLike fifty yeah he was fifty and get a couple of heart attacks and he went in for a bypass procedure\nWhich was fairly you know cardiac bypassed procedure which was he was in Philly new yeah time uh and you know it's interesting you know how new it was because if you read some of the news stories at the time about the surgery\nThey'll explains you exactly what the surgery as you know they're going to take a vein of artery from this here and play here it's like nowadays you wouldn't have to say that you know what a cardiac bypasses but that back then it was so new that that explains the surgery and\nHad the surgery and the doctors thought he was successful and um by the time they were selling 'em up he had another heart attack on the table and that was pretty much at\nSteve's with us first time caller in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Steve\nHi towards a I got a little trivia but a ride a uh I live in central New York from Seventy two to Seventy five\nAnd I worked on a military base called cynical army ... close okay and I would say a big a big arts and all that had nuclear weapons\nAre quite a few actually admitted depending on the news ah anyway rods home I Would buy two or three miles from that day\nAnd a little town called ... up the road about mowing and a half or two miles was a little post office where are you ... where I used to have a ...\nAnd that's where rod Finn died when he he had a a swimming pool built on his property there a couple of miles away right next to the base or that we're in Knoxville\nAnd uh I used to talk to the\nUh postmaster sort of like a one room a purge about it\nAnd I had a I heard rod Serling with Iran during that day comes and once in a while and I always wish I had met and but I never did\nBut I I think that's where he's a ... or send it's taped to Los Angeles through uh the uh contrived in periods a TV program and uh\nYou know he's very here where you know as I as I say you lived there right on Lake ... a an ... and that's not not far uh so yeah it could very well be and he would and he would dictate in Ithaca and some of the Senate tapes out to Los Angeles to be to be transcribed\nInteresting Steve what else you know about him was that what else do you know about it that's cool well\nUh when his career started to think a little bit ah he went back to that area [noise] and he taught at a I Believe it's Cornell University down there\nAnd uh he uh he buried not far from it it's a word ... than a little cemetery called uh inter lake and worried on the lake he must love that area and his wife or when they first got married they had their honeymoon\nThe lake or a pair of her relatives parents probably on their property and he bought it that way and they lived there and they always went back there on a summer you are right and relax\nAnd uh but uh a funny thing is you do a little radio a promotion for a people we know in the area like a street or whatever might be ... or I mean at which kind of cute you hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely ... and ... which really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it and the thing it sounds like he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or\nHe would do things like that all the time he would he would not read things for you know for free for people or people have to college or or local businesses as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and\nAnd you know going through his correspond to the wire rod Serling kept everything he ever ever since ... every letter he ever wrote he kept and that they still exist and you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally you know personal letters written the sign and everything [noise] um he took that time to do that and\nIt was really amazing that that you can't really find somebody saying a bad word about red certainly if\nYou really can't Nick we're going to take a quick break them we're gonna come back with the final phone calls with you a special guest Nick ... book of course is called rod Serling his life working imagination\nTo access the audio archives of coast to coast am log on to

[noise]\n[noise]\nStand welcome back to coast to coast Nick ... with his Nick where people get your book on rod Serling\nShould be available just about anywhere you are the books are sold as they say um you know it's available on Amazon now Barnes and noble or if they don't have it in the physical store will certainly be a blow to root for you or you can go directly to a university press in Mississippi website um belong site but if you Google that I'm sure you'll uh you'll come up with that there is well\nTell us about the rod Serling memorials foundation\nI'd love to hear some of I'm a member of the board of directors of the foundation and the Binghamton New York based charity or that looks out for rod Serling legacy and and promotes his legacy a in Binghamton or as well as around the world really and working on\nYou know we've done a couple of are we called them Serling fast the last couple of years I'm wary of essentially had a rod Serling convention or people have come and spoken and throwing his daughter and Jodie Serling they've both been you know been there and you know spoke about their dad and\nAnd we've watched rare films and you know had our discussions and radio perform scripts radio scripts performed um so I've had you know done a lot of a lot of things like that for the community\nAnd it's just about keeping rod in the public eye as much as possible and we're trying to at this point we're trying to really get a statue built for them and bring him in his home town he loved his hometown a and that should come to come across through several twilight zone episodes and so we're trying to get a statue vote for him they were trying to get a rod Serling museum in Binghamton\nOr so these are all things that were that were working towards gosh I Would love to have had them on the show necklace uh I Would love to spend five minutes with him I was five years old when he died so ... would have been something else what a great interview what about oh yeah oh yeah it was was\nTo the phones we go let's go to Linda ... in Medford, Oregon hello Lynda Barry\nMining Mick talking Tina and I'm going to Katie a that was a classic one of my favorite episodes also the man and the radio or you talking about me [laughter]\nNo man had found the ... on the radio in ... in the attic\nAnd holy damn it played music and shows they'd only he could hear the plastics\nAnd also George I wanted to um I went to praise you for um how you thought about this show tonight I mean after after Nick is that is a guess talking about haunted artifacts and they're they're tied in together so many twilight zone episode about ... not all\nAbsolutely I've gotta I've ... I've got to give credit to our executive producer Lisa lion and Tom Dan highs are our producers for putting that together\nYes and also knit\nYou saw [noise] you know that's a it's a funny question because I think most people can tell you for certain what toilets and that's what was the first one there so I cannot tell you for certain what the first one I have a so as I could probably narrow it to a couple um hitchhikers is one that I think was definitely one of the ... one of the first ones I ever saw [laughter] whatever\n... right\nYeah going my way and he's now chasing a you know chasing a driver not chasing evidence just showing up on the road constantly are on the on a road trip um that's a that's a creepy one a rod wrote that one and that was definitely one of the first ones but for whatever reason I cannot pinpoint it for sure if that's the first one I ever saw\nThe remember the plane that couldn't land in then you we do you look down and you could see the brontosaurus the dinosaurs and it just it kept going back into time I guess\nYeah it's called the odyssey of flight thirty three and it's about a plane that breaks the breaks the sound barrier and somehow finds itself back in prehistoric times and uh you know ... you know Ross brother Robert Robert certainly also a very successful writer actually wrote the the president's plane is missing which was a best seller at the time\nAnd was made into a TV movie um but he was an expert in aviation and he actually uh consult in rock consulted with him about that particular episode and other episodes they did it ever had anything to do with aviation he went to his brother offer advice on those so he actually got a technical consulting credit on on that particular episode\nNext up we go to Brad heard in the angels camp California Hi Brent heard\nHey Nick was I'm\nI'm pretty sure that this was a rod sterling a tail it involved what they call the ... that was in a capsule\nUm that started with a guy at a bar looking kind of this bonding or whatever and and uh\nProbably crying you know trying to give up drinking and somebody came up\nAnd gave him a ... said call this number\nAnd ah so he was curious he called it they said well come over to I think it was going to a place where they gave him his capsule and they said but the the one the one caviar is you cannot drink to get\nLung not drink like collies a message\nAnd well um it will\nMake you very very uncomfortable and give you a really bad stomach reacts and and so ... was was a it was some little organism and\nIt said on alcohol [noise] it was dormant alas he drank alcohol in which case it would wake up then if it would just you know crave the alcohol and make you really really sick 'cause they were growing\nThat's that sounds somewhat familiar it's it's definitely not a Serling I can tell you that for sure but it does sound that that part about it created feeding on the alcohol and growing that does sound somewhat familiar to me but it's definitely not a Serling\nSounds they are so many classic shows though they all had these different messages remember the one where the camera took pictures of the future yeah and you name it at a racetrack board and you'll get the winning horse and all that\nYeah yeah most unusual camera was called and that's one of the you know your previous caller was talking about a haunted artifacts I mean that camera was an artifact of flowers on you know they they had plenty of those the you know the telephone that the only movie was talking about that he talked to his grandmother on you know there's always those crops that are where the\nYou know where the Gulf and sort of you know so to speak of the particular episode\nMarion Rock Hill South Carolina hey there oh there\nNick got us where he is oh God oh my God I Love the bomb I go there and so forth but I got a ... one of my favorite story that you are just walk through that how 'bout that Ron serving as work in those nasty cigarette\n[laughter] nah it's unfortunate that really was addicted he tried to quit several times he just he never never could quite do it\nAll that used to think either he really loves cigarette or ... they are very real wrote him a lot of them are just ... you\nKnow you're probably right way too much he would he'd come out on the set smoking Whitney\nOh sure sure it's hard to find a picture of rod Serling where he doesn't have a cigarette in his hand it's just there was it was it was attached to him it was it was constant\nIn those days it was the thing to do I remember dean Martin lighting up on stage of Sammy Davis junior all those people would come out with cigarettes I mean it was it was the thing\nSure crazy let's go next to too\nMany well in the San Antonio Texas I menu well\nI Do enjoy good morning\nHad morning to you too thanks for calling us\nMay end up doing a great pleasure to talk to you because uh when I was thirty levy inspired me when I was young I was part of the you know when I was seven or eight years old on Fridays it would be like the\nTape thirty and then and then once I get to her and then on Saturday one night and ...\nAnd and by\nThat that was very very interesting that lack of a lineup yeah those are great days for television warranty Nick\nSome some of the more yeah you know it's one of the men will mentions the at the exact shows that were on because I can tell you uh when I was watching twilight zone when I was\nA maybe a little maybe eleven or twelve\nIt was I Would watch to end this this is a school nights and I was in fourth grade or something I Would watch it was the odd couple at eleven o'clock The Honeymooners at eleven thirty Star Trek at midnight and the twilight zone at one of them and I would I Would do my best to stay up for one thirty everything you have to watch those shows in in order and a very often would\nCarry in Kansas City Missouri is with us now Hi there\nTam craft with your memories they're fantastic all
