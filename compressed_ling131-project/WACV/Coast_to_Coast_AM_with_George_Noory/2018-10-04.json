also on the way I met a lot of really beautiful people from Arkansas and it always strikes me as somebody who is a free wing either\nOr a tribal political identity that seems to be polarizing the

I can see so much potential if people would just stop listening to this ratings the rating the horrors of of a mainstream news and just wouldn't talk to each other\nThey don't talk anymore John that's no problem nobody touch screen they argue but I've\nActually found the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive [noise] and I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington state\nAnd uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together a [noise]\nA this forecast which is the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team that you just mentioned and uh I was just reading it again after many months\nAnd I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put it in its uh that was basically is happening\nIs a\nA level of if you're gonna defined it in planets there's two major planets in astrology and political strategy their plate right now one is a is Iran and some just recently come into tours\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn Saturn long story short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in Turin fine which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations\nWhereas the earth the sign of Capricorn Saturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it\nFavors the establishment more than it favors those who are resisting the establishment\nUm because Iran has into horses in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least comfortable sign\nThat it's transfer the ... you know last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tour as it did to ... major changes in political astrology it brought the German Third Reich into being under adult Hitler\nAnd it also uh aged Franklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to\nDestabilize established a banking ideas and things that were restructured that in in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of time in history [noise]\nUh that happened because of the reforms of the banks those reforms have slowly been chipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms than Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same kind of demographics of the of the separation between the fuel all the and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth\nIs almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle and uh so\nThe the issue is the\nEarth science with the muddy place a swamp the muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come and save you from yourself\nAnd you know I have been how long long time first with art and then with the huge orange I've been\nTalking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it is really hand now it's um\nIt's not going to be when I look at when I look at the situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where Iran is going retrograde its back going backwards in in the sky which means that it's time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world especially if it isn't working\nAnd you're honest is leaving tourists around or just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into aries now what that means is that if if\n... voters Fred American voters ... early especially in the areas which will be in early times\nOn hold on per second John already at the break we'll come back and we'll talk more about this will get into some of his

a\nSuperb workers by the way John ... with us as we talk about process the predictions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many have come true already\nWell are there have been a number of the more the most shocking been my my eighth prophecy what I did is is basically short um chapters that takes a team and then looks at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines of of of the ten real quick\nYes they they were the the definition of the year being the year of exhilaration\nAt definitely things have intensified that way the second prophecy was a year on us in the last chance sec style but look at the play between Iran is in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground\nBut that petered out by may ... and that seemed to happen in a way where ... ... there was also the third prophecy will Trump be impeached or not in twenty eight team and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise]\nAh I've always said that both candidates in twenty sixteen were afflicted a astrological we both had the danger if not if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means belief office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this\nBut that they could leave in scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January [noise]\nSo ah it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before that the first half the day goes to the red states and the red voters they get out early they vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be battling for dominance in the house of representatives\nWill ah see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon so it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see in eleventh hour or\nClose to the polls are turned around so with that um you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I Would simply say about President Trump that if he survives\nAnd ... to be a two term president ...\nWhat's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and try and taking notes taking ... and it's like I mean literally is a large family members and\nOther things are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise]\nUm every everybody watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in its fall and tourists\nAre they're they're they're just watching the news and there's assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the little blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until six feet or if he's a two term president according to my interpretation of the strategy they're going to give him a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge\nAlso the other thing that once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical rice said ...\n...\nYou know I said ten months before Trump was elected I said the the big upset could happen through their\nUm and so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving\nIt's almost like it's it's a musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes all the Democrats at the same number of seats\nJust switching back and forth\nAnd in that there's not enough to create any significant legislative advance so it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before and it's almost unbearable now\nWell it's I I hate to say to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this crisis that's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states and the world\nIs just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually think of a way to get out of this merge and say it's going to have to get much worse and frankly astrology these are saying that\nThey're not going to see a tide shift until the middle of the next decade or we're\nWe're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail\nYet we're not even close it's going to get much worse in what's going to happen was kind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh and all this fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I said very clearly in my back in August eleventh in my article send the Kavanaugh would be picked\nThat um [noise] I I think people are stabbed pushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not the thing they should be looking at according to their needs\nIf you look at cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think there'll be weighed it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset\nA lot but I tell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planet so next year and into twenty twenty\nThese these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two major corporate establishment will power\nThat you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote\nA hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see who is creeping coup d'etat corporate uh hedging money which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's a sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent citizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened\nAnd so it's possible that after twenty twenty with the American people or or the working people people start really starting to get riled about situation a there will be basically in a completely corporate elite control the United states [noise]\nAnd so that's that's my call I Hope I'm wrong I Wish no more [laughter] you\nRecently were on the History Channel or the other so called the last hope and the Catholic Church of course but under fire for all kinds of atrocities lately\nAnd uh it was um [noise] it was a unique experience and and it's put me in a position that that show uh\nI mean to interrupt or kind of talk about something that happened

unfortunately with all the things we've been talking about specifically since twenty fourteen when I alerted yuan coast to coast and everybody about how we are now in Cold War two point Oh yes\nAnd how it it follows the prophetic a place where the flashpoint as the middle east I mean one of the one of the ten predictions I made in ten predictions for this year was how we'd come much closer to a a war with Iran that's happened [noise]\nUm Syria is an ally of Iran and is always a long story short the\nThe announcer dominance prophecies that are quite clear about this is a look to eagle kings

have thirty Russian warships says this time around\nAnd the ah near equal number of American ships crowding the eastern Mediterranean long story short we have a lot of military potential in a tight

Russia and then he so he could see what what the military changes the rules of engagement was going to happen with the Americans\nHe I I actually quoted a lot of this speech and it shows it's very interesting look at how we've been in an arms race again with Russia because we pulled out of the ab a missile treaty\nAnd which was a seriously destabilizing move to unilaterally do it for a long story short they had to create a new system of of weapons that could be a deterrent to was surrounding Russia's steadily with a anti ballistic missile batteries\nTo basically be able to shoot down their missiles so they couldn't defend themselves\nA very very destabilizing move a hardly reported so the Russians declared in March first set of pretty much we're in this Cold War and they have now made a parity you know interestingly enough fruit and drops ten billion dollars off the eighty billion dollar budget of the Russian\nSeven billion to something that's past seven hundred billion if you add the other sides to it were really spend the one point one trillion dollars [noise]\nUh on defense spending in our military ironically it's half of what the US people produce monetary lead GDP\nEvery year which is exactly what happened at the same time when the Soviet Union collapsed it was paying half of its money into its big military and they collapsed\nWe're doing the same thing so

just a second I just have one more area to talk with John about and he's writing a book about the late celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and\nBoy you sparked my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a tale of two suicide a and both of us committed suicide the reason I Am speaking to you is because\nMy experience with suicide was the spiritual suicide rather than the usual what I call mundane who is most people and count\nIn the mundane suicide I contend that you end up with your pain destroying the body mind that ... that you're mystery of Seoul is living in but in the suicide that happened to me rather than the one that I was indeed mundane league going to do [noise]\nI saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and I remained\nAnd so this is one of my most intimate autobiographical tales of a whole other dimensions of my life for all these years I've never known this way I was I was I was walking through a golf course in San Pedro California\nI just come back from India and I was still in the tender opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher in India for the first time and when it came back in the world the world that was not a place that supported this kind of individual flowering and it was having a very bad day\nAnd so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful a golf course adjacent to the trailer park because I Lived in [noise]\nAh overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliffs and as I was walking it just dawned on me and says I could just keep walking a beyond these cliffs and plummet down three hundred feet into the rocks\nAnd I was going to do it because suddenly\nIce had this amazing unexpected experience of life and death suddenly being very tangible and clear out to see how they're really one there really there are plenty of compliment trees or in our fear there are plenty of terror and opposites\nBut what was happening to me the feeling was trying to describe it but it's beyond words really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um it was descending on me faster than myself and I thought okay this is happening because I have made the decision to throw myself walk over this cliff\nIf I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences overtaking me this mystery of life meeting death [noise]\nSo I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat up against and I said okay for throwing myself over I just wanted to feel this and take this with me over the edge [noise]\nAnd so I sat there just going inside and feeling it at some point I felt this electrical energy just rise above the ground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass\nOr I just began sobbing sobbing and suddenly all of that thank God all of that so that otherwise I wouldn't be killing the human no not at all [laughter] and uh\nAnd and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turn and there was a little eucalyptus tree and it was just shivering it sleeves and the Santa Ana wind and it was just this moment where ... sky the earth tree\nExistence love me existence sees\nEverything that's created out of it as a phenomenal creation rising and falling as something absolutely integral significant\nAnd I had this feeling that so much of what society does to make us feel in significant when you go in and even at that moment of life meeting death insignificant becomes in significant\nI it's so the story is really an ... it's a it's a jump from what I usually you write about but it's a whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I\nThe nine sometimes my these books you see I I don't write these books they right they use me to write themselves and I had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died\nHow deeply he his his suicide how much he was loved and how many many people were shot in the story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this book I'm In a cashiers line\nAnd there's this old lady and she's doing something looks like she's never done before she's pulled actually a magazine out of Iraq and looks at it and it's the people magazine a van seaboard Dane and I've watched how she touched his cheek on the picture the way she did it was so\nIntimate and beautiful and that's when I realized yeah I Love him just as much and I think I think I understand what he was going through he was not a man to bullies\nOr in fairy tales and imaginary stuff and that Santa Claus is going to save him from his sins and all that it's really pretty practice and and and and people like that when they die and I always feel there is a person that has the potential to become a an awakening one\nAnd I as I have been in my private life which I'm sharing more and more now in this period especially now when there's so much turmoil when there's so much\nI'm a mixed and polarity my inner life now as a meditate or is now coming more and more into my work because it is is still ... point this\nCenter of silence and peace in the cycle of life that's becoming stronger and stronger that\nIs what I can share with all of you and meditation the science of self observation\nIs is what what more and more I always thought my my work with them evil more and more and it's still prophetic but it's going to have more of my own authority through my own experiences\nSuch huge on let's take some calls here in the ten minutes we got left Thomas in Iran with John Home Tom\nHi George thank you for taking my call an job while [laughter] it's hard to follow your are sharing of your experience on that but my question John is for a person to walk in the world to be a participant in the world\nHow can they develop their own centered ness so to speak such that they are on a dead on a dead on touch my personal and planetary astrology\nWell where I can only suggests and I think only anyone who's honest and heart to heart with anybody is all I can suggest as my own experiences the meditation techniques that I've been using since Nineteen eighty [noise]\nAnd uh so my answer to that is if any of you listening to this resonate with what I've been saying [noise]\nEspecially with the shoe suicide in life meeting death [noise] um I Am on a path where I can say there is a way to look beyond and not be touched you can be passionate and deeply into life but you're not overwhelmed ... you can be a Buddha and the market place but not of the marketplace of the world [noise]\nAnd that was what my teacher taught oh show and that is what I've live
