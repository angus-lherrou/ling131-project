a gym nine Nineteen twelve ...\nOff the lights were out in ... new to a um\nA a a dispute between the ... city council and the power company for their heads city lights and street lights but they were out of his and the town was in complete darkness or this Sunday night ... there was a church service\nOr a or a Sunday night church service organized by one of the victims of that either the woman who was the head of the house after the\n... after the ... I didn't get into that it's in the book but I think it's true I don't believe that the voters can murders what ... what ever happened when they did and the light spin on and the reason that was true\nHis that he had committed another atrocity is six days earlier about a hundred hundred miles away [noise] ...\nAnd he normally would not have [noise]\nUh had another outraged that quickly but because the ... lights the city was plunged into darkness it was a perfect opportunity for him and he couldn't pass it up\nAnyway ... um [noise] uh the two little girls named Ida Lena still under went home with a more family the family of Henry More they walked home after the church service ...\nAnd and ah the little girls spent the night with the their friend the little girl was a member of the

good thing that she had been [noise] uh she had been outraged after death the I'm a ...\nIn any case the crime was not\nThere was a a great uproar as you can imagine but the crime was not solved\n... uh two years later I caught a man named Jay and walk her son came to Alaska and realized that he could sustain a phony investigation of the crime\nBy keeping people angry or he could keep donations coming in by keeping people angry a ... ... and he did that by accusing a a very prominent local set of them Frank Joan of finance through the crime\nThere isn't any chance the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he had an any any connection to it but this campaign to prosecute Frank Jones a divided pulled us\nIn a horrible and unprecedented way the city fought over whether or not Jones did it or didn't do it for several years\nUh and became a K better badly divided community you know families on one side of the line wouldn't play with families on the other side of the line they wouldn't

stories unsolved crimes stories are treated\nYet at the same time it speaks to the fact that there weren't a cold case police officers working the the crime still crimes have been at that time might have been solved by\nAfter that period of time by somebody writing a letter confessing symphony knowing somebody that wasn't meant to almost literally like fall in their lab which again comes back to the the power of storytelling\nAnd how he just by keeping my telling a story to beginning middle and end of these events\nIt doesn't matter how old the story is is that it will get people to listen again into reconsider again and most likely to connect again to that sense of outrage\nAbout what had happened and so you know a static police report won't necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah\nAlso keeps kind of the idea of the murder alive it it makes it it gives you a sensation again it is it that is you know the core of sensationalism but it does it make it make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happened had they had they built you know any kind of memorial to the family\nHad there been any had there been what had\nThe town done to try to come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this con men coming to town there afterwards\nOr the ... ... a ... well there was I don't know that there was that ... percent about I don't know that anyone build a memorial to them uh um for many years the ... or\nAuthority than I Would say that it's still true today that pay the\nThe chamber of commerce tribes pipes and below ... was known for something else right right the ah ... there is a the house for the crime occurred is still standing of his operated as a kind of of more tourism\nOr it's the it's a shows up on\nHer a normal ... TV shows and people pay to take tours of the house\nThe um a lot if you drive around ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but but but uh where the ... what ... is known for is not mentioned anywhere\nThey um uh that's not an appropriate I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial right\nThe um uh I don't know that it raises an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial to the victims victims were mostly poor people most people without\nA without one and the more family was very well like they are and the community uh thought well on them and the rigorous efforts to solve the crime war I kind of memorial to them or by that I don't think there was any physical memorial to\n[noise] you know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers ... where there is an effort to try to so it isn't enough to be like a statue\nBut it's interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics peace and that explains everything you know that that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not you know\nThe um the one of his rather than maps and trains crimes are the double murder and Colorado Springs it murder two families in one night and joining how the uh uh but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell yeah oh that's a house right there um but it still has not forgotten or many places\nMany places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally and absolutely forgotten but in some of the ... still quite well remember [noise]\nSo I wanted you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice here because [noise]\nIt was really hoping to finish the book before the interview but I really want to get to the part about how you think you live narrowed down this suspect so let's let's go to that let's go through that process Ninety victims [noise]\nSorry I got that wrong [laughter] um but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing or you looked at these ah you looked at these murders\nAnd you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove it or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders\nWere going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right [noise]\nRight well the murder of entire family and one of that is a is a rare that it was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nYou know it means even as you mentioned there just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't last for long because there wasn't a lot of funding but so as let's let's let's go down this path of of the process that you used to try to actually\nNarrowed down to a name to a person\nI've I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to\nTo name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example and including going through ships registries and finding whether or not there was a particular sailor that coincided with the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England but happen in Central America or happened in in wherever and so they were able to try to find you know well the sailor went from this port to that port and in each one of these ports there was a murder so it's it ... it but you have to have\nIt's it's just nice maybe um you know to to looking at it broadly your ear you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing research like this so you you don't you know is it even possible that a name could even be sound\nGiven the scarcity and information about you know people are public registries during that period\n... intervention to Jack the ripper case I Am I read I read [noise]\nProbably twenty bucks saying that the river was this guy or Dexter ever was that guy reject the a and I and my other book popular crime I'm made fun of the people who wrote those books um the uh uh because I don't [noise]\nI don't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to me Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are silly the um I never really expected that we would find a convincing argument\nAbout who this who was doing the same I mean we were looking gas\nAnd Rachel says she did expect to find him but I didn't the ... a lot when we walk the crimes backward [noise] uh there is a crime in Massachusetts and Eighteen Ninety eight that Rachel says the moment she saw that she knew it was him\nThe um uh uh and that was because I had told her that this guy would make mistakes and in his first crime he did make numerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was\nThe uh uh but the number of details that match up from the first crime to let's say Alaska is is just it's beyond anything that you would [noise]\nSuspect was a\nCould be coincidence and I'll I'll mentioned just a few things\nYeah please do that or did you want me to give you the name or not it doesn't\nMatter the newly will go through the coincidence or go through the the similarities first\nWell ... the first crimes that were [noise]\n... publicly link where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes and the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously by the same man and the the tech the same detectives happen to be investigating him I thought this is the same guy I mean that crime or a month ago down\nSouth for the the uh uh\n... ... that criminal had size six feet or the um [noise] there's another crime in Maine and Nineteen oh two in which the criminals I\nWish there were a pair of boots cramps that were central to the trial or again size six feet is a very uh uh the the ... we we know that this was a small man well it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet\nNot speculation he did\nWe know that we ... it was believed that he was small because I'm the a\n... a ... and in other places when he swung the acts the ceiling was very low the sailing is only about seven feet high in the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his head he just barely grazed the ceiling\nIf a person of normal size a person of a if a person a large man could not swinging acts over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling because of that it was believed that he had to be small he was five foot for the uh\nIf you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ... you could see clearly whether it's the guy is basically left handed over to basically right handed that's a pretty easy thing to see\nIt was believed that the murder and Alaska was left handed the man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed\n[noise] we had said that he had to be a well the first stories about him say that he was an experience trapped than he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settled down into an area [noise]\nWe had said that he must work as a longer because\nAll of the crimes for about ten years occur and logging areas the first story about him or her stories about him specifically say that he was an experienced blogger for the uh uh the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the\nA ... girl or a that was there and the first crime [noise] in the first cry he always killed the man of the house first and the ... ah and ended with the murder of a young girl so that's what he did and first crime\n... he always used the blind side of the X.\nI never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a sharp type backs but it was always his intention to use the blind side of the acts in this first crime blunt side of the acts and as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that\nThe uh uh ... the crime just matches up on too many points for you to think that\n... citizen him [noise]\nSo they started to look for five foot four left handed ... blogger ax murderer or ... ... ... ...\n... how did you begin to narrowly name out of that\nThe when he committed first crime he uh\n... it was obviously ... who when he committed first crime is obvious who had committed it because he was living with the family which that's a common thing or a cereal murders first crime he often kills people to whom he his directly connected and [noise]\nI can be tied so we killed the first family and Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who had done it because he fled the scene and I would say they were looking for is just that all of these other facts are about the first about the criminal happened to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd the name that you believe you know the men on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using there was all Miller the weather that we use ... he wouldn't even a German immigrant who they are whether that was his actual name or not I'm a ... is speculation he could have been using a false name even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWe've found no I shouldn't say we found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published found a the the ships record in which he had entered the country about an Eighteen Ninety the I'm a probably a man named Paul Miller had entered the country\n... I'm ... on a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know if\nIt was like it and then walk side to side with the uh uh and the uh uh uh uh uh they they said well if he had been in the German army a German Navy so ah they found the ship within which became what came into the country\n\nFor the bowling goodness\nNo it's a if you're on a ship it if I was taking a cruise sometimes I've ever read off his ship rocks from side to side and when you view Iraq from side to side for a day or two before you start walking oh interesting if you're a secular for years and years then you never get over it if it always walk inside rocks from side to issue\nLast spring make sure your heater in reading things today and he said I can hear the whole set of them are really not not that I got a ... because there's nobody to Alabama turned to Haitian number\nChevrolet Master control centers visit W.

my previous question about dropping the acts\nThat wasn't so much thinking in terms of bigger print evidence I was thinking that could lead some of the need to find out where he had purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had in the house that's the one he left behind\nWhich is another point

is apparently the original story from which the kinds of ... among the autos is based there are a poll also of course with a with a avid reader crime stories as as I'm sure you know\nThe uh anyway the answer is no ... is the absolute Lee was not trying to get caught in ... many many many serial murderers are sort of playing games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it\nUh but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it\nBut that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual a aversion to being caught he didn't he wasn't he wasn't the absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent and very well thought out\nInvasive action not ever to be caught one reason he never took it\nIf there was a hundred dollars sitting on a shelf there it wouldn't take it because he knew very well but if he was caught fleeing a crime scene playing a scene with or something that could be tied to that scene he ... a lot of people were executed for that the\nSo no he was he was very these are quite unusual extent I had a an aversion to being caught\nSome serious restraint afraid they're going to guide you didn't have any money that that this is some discipline that you mentioned was good in marine who's in Athens, Georgia or coast to coast for a Bill James Murray\nEnd and you know um well I was calling because I I was kinda curious the first of all you got out talking about the acts and um my my brother and I we were investigating murder happened it was after the civil war in our family um\nAnd he was my great how will remain that grandfather that was he was killed with an act\nAnd the same thing to his wife and maybe a son did that and ended up being a brother in law that was convicted of it and um he was right out and I feel I can hope that field workers would be blamed for but anyway and so we were investigating that and then\nMy brother was murdered a year ago\nAnd then his son is in jail for killing a guy about two years ago by now so if there's been a lot of it around but um\nWas wondering you may you mentioned earlier about\nA person you know if they didn't make a lot of mistakes and the person that we believe that killed my brother he um he seemed to be\nWell so far he's gotten away with it and how do you find out I mean about a person that if you um you know where they're from ... but\nSee I'm just wondering if maybe he had done this before you know what I mean he was\nBecause every little detail he's saying he had no here we go in and\nIt's interesting that was just it seems to perfect for the first time so what you're saying\nI certainly feel for you I'm very sorry about go walk through the meat you know you are and and I wish there was anything that would be helpful to you but I there really isn't\nI mean I I think as I said in our case we were just very fortunate to uh to find this treasure trove of information about the about the first crime the but I I it's not something you can and we if we could do it Rachel if I were to sit out\nI saw in other series of crimes like this ... we wouldn't it wouldn't happen for us to do because it wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew what we were doing it just the way the crime set up the way the story set up for for us\nYou know I'm again I'm Sorry but the Murray let's go to my uh ... in New York for a Bill James on coast to coast am\nMorning gentlemen and when a delight to ah I see on your back in the saddle massive what good luck with that Web looking forward to it but\nI have a a two part question with some comment and outlets and I'm over the ones not to add New York it's it's over there in that spot is now we have especially with all the pages that at hand\nPeople at the FBI or can say this profile lays it no\n... if you put in a more modern contacts\nI ... followed might might flash this guy out much Florida I'm off so I'd like to hear more about and whether it's in a book in time and have somebody in a sense that got caught up include in black people who um\nWound up but not even going to trial but getting England and the last part is uh I I you mentioned about the state at least at this time at the time that the sanctuary that fill out a hum a\nAt I recently read a book by um you know it may see as it's called how I became white is on the ... Arab pre civil war and he actually tried to police besides the fact that you know they had like two hours looking for a fugitive\nBlack folk but pay off their black then basically competing gang basically street gang with volunteer fire department\nThat at containing spite thin and ... and I like in common that whether he's familiar with gangs that came up as as that that form been hit by a lease and I'll let you know over the Internet thank you so much for\nYour for your most intelligent questions you know I'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gangs are from New York and ... pretty civil war because they\nAre I wrote about them in the book popular crime or they were in a it was a woman this gets back to poll there there was a woman named Mary Rogers or who was murdered in New York and I want to say in Eighteen forty fry were there about\nA poll poll fictionalized then the murder Murray rosy but the actual woman's name was very Rogers the uh in ... the uh there was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her cry for that\nCrime but then it really is an odd thing that there were these fire houses that were really just just a\nA house with his family ... pretty unruly people are and they they were kind of terrorizing the city so yeah I I Do that that's an odd story isn't it\nThey didn't hang on I'm going to put opinion you're right there because we want to get back to ... and and the ... which is definitely in the book and then the state of the police news or the other questions you\nHave a chance to answer coming up just a minute and Dennis and Danes please hang on for Bill James taking your questions and comments about the story of the men from the train on coast to coast am\nWe've got callers coast to coast leading to talk with Bill James give us a minute here's we wrap up the last question\nUm we talked about how there were in fact gangs of fire departments and\nAnd I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to ... you can watch the movie streets in New York right the ... there's a lot of that that's a little strange and in there that's kinda cool but uh she liked it because the question about what it at the end of modern police or FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI I haven't asked and do that because that would not be in my nature I mean\nYou know what this is my book is written to say this is what I think and if you think something different that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask\nThe ah John Douglas and monitored a well known profiled are has spoken and written about Alaska or one of his observations was that ah the\nUm ... well he had several observations about all of the crime that lined up with what we believe for other reasons one was that the murder of had to be older because he is extremely organized I mean is it off the chart of how organized is is burger this guy is\nUnbelievably organized or the or and and also he he um he said that Robert ... Kelly who was accused of murder is it for us to really couldn't have done it a because his mind is very disorganized but also because it was not physically strong enough\nUm we know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely angel the um uh so if there's something there's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't\nAsked profile operated opinion I frankly wouldn't care what they have to say because you know they got their opinion I got mine so a lot of the book is about innocence accused of the times that I'll tell you briefly just one of those stories\nAnd murder in Maine and Nineteen oh to a man named Henry Lambert who was white obviously and then sent was accused of the crime [noise]\nIt was just a a he was a a I'm not around me was I got a an an educated illiterate French Canadian who uh who uh you know ... borderline almost drank quite a bit\nIt was accused of the crime and it was in prison for Twenty years or before a ... it became a cause for lab in Maine and a very good lawyer eventually what we're trying to free him and then ... the governor of Maine eventually\nA graphic additive fall apart and put him on a on base\nBuddy that happened after we spent Twenty years in jail there are a lot of stories like that in this in the book it's quite on it for a terrible side effects of what happened and I think it was New York police are\nAre not relevant to this story because they were by Nineteen ten in the New York city police were relatively organized and relatively sophisticated not relative to know how but but relative to the places where these crimes occurred these crimes occurred in places it didn't have a place to park they are they are they had like a city Marshall and that was it\nThe er so it's not it's not really you know the uh not really that connected to my book [noise]\nYou know fairness um but it just to illustrate ... in that movie of of how those gangs tied to operate within the government as they were everybody was vying for jobs even if the ... getting in fights to keep them on and in the end by the way I think profiling\nWould endorse what you've done I think you'd so I don't think you'd be a very proud of the way in which they would ... I Hope\nSo it's not as you know really mean it did I don't think I think they would endorse it and I think they would find some interesting insights and there but then she'll first time caller Jay Z in Chicago on coast to coast am for Bill James days\nHow can they go ahead\nOn I'm I'm Glad to hear you back on the coast the calls\nI think us yeah\nThank you um\nI have a couple of comments for\nMr james ...
