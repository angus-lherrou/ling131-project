overestimate your speeds because of the fact that they use but the encrypting important thing but this one is it to lower pressure than Florence\nA which means the title search will be a bit higher but the other important thing is they're hitting a coach find that very shallow and what's been happening since the uh over the last six thousand years is the Gulf of Mexico coach is\nA is dropping down if he's sending the sea levels rise in there\nBecause of the weight of the ice taken off from the last ice age there they'd be pointing at this and claiming I Would feel awful rights but no it is it's a change of the whole coastline there\nThe other problem that they've got is that uh the the land or that the Americans going to go over is already saturated so normally most soils couldn't take about six inches of rain before they come\nSaturated you've got flooding but these are already factory to someone else so that's a little bit problematic but the other thing is of course they thought

author partner at the sherpas technology group in Silicon valley of former investment banker with UPS and New York his world view his\nSeem period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country the mainstream assumptions consciousness has not produced by the brain now after researching extensively he wrote this book in the end the upside down thinking to introduce all a bus to these cutting edge ideas and series on coast to coast I bet just really shocked you wouldn't usually more didn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me and thank you for having me on\nWhile I'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of gas scientists and people who are experts on the brain\nDoes consciousness exist outside of the brain or not know the pure scientists to a medical professional folks more would always say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness in the brain dies it all goes with it\nAnd I've always thought no there's something else here which consciousness you finally found out did you\nI did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the materialist science camp which suggests that the universe is fundamentally made of matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago filling the universe with physical material that we call matter\nAnd when you have enough matter in this big universe you're bound to get interactions between those pieces of matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're ... you're bound to end up with a self replicating molecule like DNA chances that would happen and DNA leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being a human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that the perspective\nAnd if you buy into that which I used to and then when the brain dies\nConsciousness dies memories are gone than when you think about meaning in life if you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one of the dead there is no memories there is no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned in science and most of science today\nKnow looking at your ... I Would lose money in a bet saying that you would write a book about consciousness how in the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter]\nSo it was about two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally materialist that's what I Would call it now in hindsight\nUh but I I randomly stumbled across a cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had\nAnd at the end of it her name is Laura Powers\nShe mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers and I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula\nAnd I listen to a different episodes and people there were many different people who talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities ... consciousness to survive bodily debt\nThings I had no familiarity with\nAn overtime just hearing enough different people describing similar perspectives on reality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real\nAnd this was a very jarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless and here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that process has consciousness\nAnd the identity that we have is not\nTied to the body so that totally freaked me out [laughter] and uh changed my world view completely led me down the path of intense research because I needed to rethink all reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in financing consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends\nIt sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with the topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight\nSo after hearing enough of this feedback and also the thing that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend and I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days\nAnd ended up writing more than half of the book that is now out\nAnd then finished over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript\nAnd ultimately a cold emailed Gladstone who's now my agent at my publisher multiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents Eckhart totally\n... cheaper Neal Donald Walsh who um [noise] and so that's where we are\nSuper now what do you mean by an end to upside down thinking\nI consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness [laughter]\nWhat I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing on space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness consciousness comes first\nWell right without the brain those consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests no word science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggests that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine\nOr I talk about near death experiences and if you'd asked me a few years ago what's near death experience I Would have said well isn't that just loose nation that happens when someone is about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described in the near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as a vertical out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back into their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that is suggestive of some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark Goldberg dot com is linked up for you and coast to coast

your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nA great question I'm often asked that I Would say yet they were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until I put the pretty cognition tell us just a cycle can he says you you of course we learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nAbsolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics on science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about ... what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt that way who was a a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigate\nAnd what's the most daunting things but what did you find\nIt yeah it's a lot but these are very important phenomenon it's it's mine too mine communication and just taking a quick step back\nThe reason that I examine each of these phenomenon is that I reason that\nThe material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain that perspective cannot account for things like ... and the and the other things will talk about and I reason that any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work [noise]\nSo ... to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns held experiments and the basic design is as follows and I should say that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you combined the result\nThe statistics are very compelling and Dr dean rate and who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma six sigma refers to statistical odds against chance when you get a six sigma result the odds of that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to one\nAnd in telepathy we have six sigma results of the guns thought experiment the study has one person in her room we'll call him Bob and very very relaxing state listening to relaxing music there's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room\nChain has given a picture by the experimenter is an experimenter say chain I Know that sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally send\nA picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room so Jane is mentally sending this image to Bob Bob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture jam was looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all that Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent right\nNow the ... the last probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials\nBut instead it's closer to thirty two percent\nSo from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically it suggests that something is getting through and it actually conforms to our commonsense everyday experience because if we were one hundred percent ...\nThen we would know each other's thoughts all the time sure instead it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they test you or they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase ... percent mark is at the center for the receiver\nIs this something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a has had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better meditate or ... seem to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI've always wondered though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events without really having the sender heavy much to do with it\nI think that's a receiver might have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... ethic or communications with the deceased through medium ship either people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that's not localized to the body\nWe are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver the person in the room and simply not show them any of them for pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she said to them\nWhat do you think would happen\nWell well I think\nWe'd have a distribution first of all we had an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic then we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw what the US government uh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be the more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nAnd let's talk about the U.S government studies and the the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me on the program is sometimes referred to as Stargate Program their use psychic buys for national security purposes\nMany of wearing a been on this show by the way\nUp during the Cold War and and the people who have more involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many remote viewers who are involved to say this was a real so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real I'm\nIn my book I I have some documents from the CIA which had been declassified recently\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was one but remote viewing is the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being they're physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that's far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes\nIt sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain but if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable\nDocuments um say explicitly and I I'm looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon\nThis is from a classified document that has been released recently [laughter]\nSo I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that in my business world that I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me at least made me question things\nUm even further than that there's a page on science and all and there's some very credible people including a someone from Cal Tech\nNext page in the document says science panel's report principle findings he's a direct quotes implications are revolutionary evidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we have the looked at these uh tell a path ... studies and I've always wondered\nIf the government really never stopped doing it but continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies that just that same question and they said no it stopped because they would have kept us on they would have used us I'm not sure what the government has found other people\nAnd they've continued these kinds of mine studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used\nTo find a downed Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful\nSo you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that organizations would be trying it\nPretty cognition mark they very valuable tool for people\nThe two cents things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them now a lot of people don't react they don't do it it's something happens and they go oh I should have done that I I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies which show a very subtle pre cognition known as pre sentiment where the bodies sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to show it before something happens\nAnd there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream known as a pre pocketing dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it that\nMuch less subtle but if we go to the pre sentiment studies this is where I think it becomes very compelling again if we look at the meta analysis of all the statistics\nThat basic design is as follows it it reverses what we look at in psychology typically\nEnron try and bring their own supplies do everything from ... residential to post construction

[laughter]\nYou know I personally don't believe I mean I was brought up Catholic um sometimes I Believe if there is a hell in the afterlife it's because we created ourself\nUm I don't believe that you know there is necessarily a hell no\nInterest you know what drugs you why do you keep investigating\nI don't I I investigate because I don't feel\nI can stop sometimes you know I over the years um I've\nWell here's your like addicted to it [laughter]\nMm no not addicted to it but to me when I'm In\nKnow investigating a lotta times I'll use energy and expend energy when I'm doing that um and if I don't I feel like sometimes if I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing\nMy life kind of it's like wreaking havoc right I'm like a buildup of energy and if I'm working I Do a lot of technical work I Do a lot of work on computers um and occasionally when I was ...\nI Would tend to uh fly a lot of my electronics\nAre fringe ... role to forward to your book more a ghost chronicles and he of course is the author of the world's most polluted places what a great investigator she is boring\nOh he's fantastic I Love just\nAnd uh just a gay guy you know I I see you met a bench all the time and I mean he's always upbeat and courteous ... just a just a nice guy\nHe is he's a nice guy and you know I met Jeff ... boy probably about\nFifteen Years ago on and he always has a nice word he always worked really hard at what he does and you know he believes in helping people so that to me makes a huge difference and it's not just you know all about me all about money it's all about how you're going to serve and help other\nWhen you're on an investigation do you go over to quit mentioned a number of people\nYes yeah there is a team I'm over the years that team has changed and has grown and we have a\nYou know comedians at work with us um we have people that work specialize on the electronics they work with the M. F. meters on you know we have those that use the quarter is and I think it's just a good team of people that have worked together for so long on just have a routine down\nHave you ever been on an investigation Maureen were you what are we better get out of this thing and get out no more than\nOnce really [laughter] yeah there's there's been a couple um ... there's been a few\nAnd when those moments happen there even though they're rare it's still a nerve and you know I mean one would say well I'm not afraid of anything that you know he'll say but to me\nYou know you have to just keep aware and uh I don't intend to feel the effects of an investigation let's say over a period of time has no joy if it's taking energy for me if it's feeling you know I'm literally like I have a pain in my chest or I'm feeling all the uh\nYou know after effect would say um I still have to work a day job so it could into the air and that's one thing I always have to kinda be aware of\nWhat would you say has been the most fascinating case you've been on\nA date\nOh T's fascinating um to me we investigated the Portsmouth White House um one time and there was a the last White House keepers wife ... small I Believe what's her name\nAnd to me it was fascinating because this was the sweetest woman that had come through I felt for energy and it was nice for change you know so I wasn't\nI wasn't in fear for feeling um painter having any ill effects\nAnd it just was a pleasant feeling and what was even nicer it was after we would have done and I was investigating she came through she was so excited she I channel surf felt like she just was so excited to be alive again so she can talk to the people around her\nBut to me what really what's fascinating was you know we investigate and a lotta times it's you know ... century afraid that you're dealing with the you don't necessarily see the person face to face that you can overcome you know communicated with\n'em and so we had done a talk\nAfter this investigation um and once we did that talk you know here's this woman ... small her pictures life size in front of me and I just I didn't expect it but I literally just broke down because it was again the first time I got to really see a woman I just felt a connection to her that they couldn't explain\nYou know that's kind of that's got to be emotional sometimes when you see things like that and I bet when you were in the ... you know you look at a gravestone than you actually think you know\nAnd you know ... or right here in the show up on a ghostly operation attached to that that's got to be emotional for people did you ever have you ever just broken down\nOr you know I've broken down on while I Try not to break down but when I'm done reading for people um you know and I've actually\nYou know you you talk about the loved ones you talk about I mean these are real people you're talking about you know their pains and they served and it doesn't help them really to break down but you can't help it sometimes because if you're compassionate and you have a hard it's hard not to\nUm as much as you probably try to try to stay focused you you know you get involved in these things\nYou do definitely down you can put yourself in their place and and realize that you know our own mortality right so you can you come face to face with dealing with death on many occasions it can be hot breaking\nWhat would you change the strangest case you've come across strangers skittish\nStrangest case okay well when Ron would take me out to investigate many times can just take them all the time he would never tell me where we were going\nOn because it's the keep me honest right so I'm not Googling mind that information and your boss I'm the one day he gave me a call and say hey marine you know I have this case it's ten in the morning you know can you come with me it's really only take us in our\nYou know ha ha ha so yeah exactly and you know run\nYou know he's very creative right so I said\nOkay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we go to this home it's just you know little ranch style house and\nWe we get there and is this you know meant to guys there wanted they just look really rough and tumble is you know and this one guy you know like one I think his name was most in this big big guy covered in tattoos and we just tried it you know\nJust overwhelming right to sit there and so one is just looking at me and we get in this house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and the mirrors the shattered glass table been busted and it just looked like someone through the house with a bat\nUm it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know they've my phone's been ringing with all the rules on it and my wallet went missing and now he's telling me all these things and he kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see we can pick up\nSo after a few minutes I'm thinking oh God this is not a little girl I could feel this you know a spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this isn't meant no it's not and he was getting adamant that you know it wasn't and I need to talk to\nUse them brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right um he leaves Ron up at the top of the driveway with the guy moose any dragged me down on the on the driveway and he looks and he said I Want you come back here tonight by yourself\nAnd I said well you know I really don't feel it's a little girl and you're going to be careful you know you don't want to welcome\nIn something that you don't know is there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering my\nBest friend and he said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want to hear and I thought oh my God I just have to get out of here\nSo that is scary and we'll be back in the moment with more coast to coast\nAnd if you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness it's possible you could add a trio of ...

England ghost project with a degree and environmental science now he was a skeptic however a near death experience changed all that for him no longer blinded by his skepticism uses scientific background now to seek the truth about the unusual in paranormal\nIn addition to hosting ghost chronicles undergoes village radio when I tunes\nHe hosts a weekly Internet radio show on target net dot com and also has co written books with Maureen the ones I've told him told you about more ghost chronicles and ghost a day welcome Ron\nYeah so tell me about this near death experience\nYeah everybody wants to hear about that I think that's the funniest thing because ah I I had my ah fingers off on a table saw and oh\nYeah well you know anyways uh I went to the hospital and they looked at it and they really couldn't do anything at that time\nSo they cannot wrap them up and nice and and kept me an emergency room until they can bring a specialist on them six and a half hours later they put them all back together and ah\nYou know that was fine but during the night um my doctor came up to see me and she realized something was wrong even though I I I thought I felt fine and she called me and for a CAT scan actually had to bring the the woman in a hospital was nobody on at that time and they realized they had to put Murray embolism\nAnd from then on things began to have a well Lewis is all going on I had what I Believe was a near death experience and it's not like the\nThe usual when Jay here and and that's it was I was just basically in a different place was extremely\nBright white I guess it's the best way to describe it in and uh they were a papal their figures anyways I couldn't really see any features or anything but they were also white and\nThe weird thing about it is also there was what I thought was it sounds really ... music it had that mhm type thing and uh also it it felt a\nMan there's a line in the McDonald's on like a prayer that I always quote not as if I like home with a very comfortable it was very warm and then the whole thing just be dissipated like the closing of an Irish and it was in the wrong break with us and it was just the\nDoctor or a ICU that it was and then there was no music was just my heart beat on the morning there was nobody around and certainly wasn't to walk them\nSo I when I got to the hospital I didn't know if it was a true experience or was it just the drugs they gave me so that's how I kind of got into the paranormal\nWhen did you conclude that the it wasn't just the drawings that there was something really unusual going on here for you\nKnow it's something you just have to um what's the word I'm looking for ... his\n... they're really either believe it or not and uh\nSo uh I Know that I had this experience can I tell you it is absolutely a an idea that ... that the experience you know I can absolutely tell you it wasn't no so it's one of those mystery that that pushes me to the other things that I Do did\nThey re attached the fingers were they able to do\nYeah yeah oddly enough and I'm I'm going to cut off\nI cut the the mental one all my luck to you in the middle and totally off the the um next to it I had several places that was a kind of dangling the top of the fun I had\nCut off completely uh they actually put a ... when they put together my middle thing and so if I ever give anybody a finger I always tell them it's not me\n[laughter] 'cause it's cause us to ask about one\nThat was a joke [laughter] ha ha ha at three thirty in the morning it's good\nSo as soon as the hand works normally\nYes it's amazing to guide yep it's a look at the time it's it's a you know a little difficult with the cold but ah\nYeah it's fine now tell us about the New England goes project that you started what the what is that\nIt's a ... a parallel mogul was for um probably\nBut get out of hospitals looking for something to do and a media one was often a course in TV production at the time because my hand was cast and it was all kinds of blunt than us and things so it looked interesting and\nIt was a thorough cause but are not completely you had to do it on a a show on something and I spend all had this near death experience was that drugs they gave me a lot and also I own a manufacturing company manufacturing company was supposed to be haunted by\nPeople that weren't there and uh you know it hurts all kinds\nOf [noise] but anyways I ended up so I said you know what I'm going to do it all goes as a lock\nAnd uh that's how it all started that went on my first ... TV show slash investigation and ah I realized that were a lot of things even though I have a good science background that they couldn't explain and I was curious and I'm curious I get them all I did it and eventually I\nBegan to doing it fulltime and you lost that I Do because they still\nNot sure of all the things that happen what's real and what's not\nYou've got a degree in environmental science\nIf you were on the moon program as well\nWho are interested in in ... you were a skeptic but now you're a believer that you've made this full circle how far are you on the other side now that you believe this\nYou know I Believe there's something here I Believe in an afterlife do I believe that\nEverything I see and and it's you know I'm always skeptical bite my science spring I guess you want to call it a on my grounding and brain always you know makes me do what's going on and I've had a lot of unique experiences but uh [noise]\nIs it enough there that I Know that the experience has happened but are they really paranormal around you know something else mentioned Asian or something I just can't explain\nWhat keep striving you why do you keep doing this\nOh there's a lot of reasons the the primaries is to try to understand it more I Try to understand\nAll aspects of the pound level just not going in as a you know\nWell to give you an idea a when I first started doing this I thought that a medium where shall within like a ... at the beach with forging telling and uh when I met more rain I was pretty much the same category but I figured it couldn't hurt\nTo at least a try to understand what they are and who they are and what they do\nAnd uh so that's kinda my whoa aspects of what I Do even if I don't believe in anything I'm always open minded enough to at least try to understand if I'm going to criticize it I got to know as much as I can about it to do that so that's kinda\nHow I Am more open minded but still it at that heavy skepticism\nWhat do you think of her abilities as as a medium\nOr more me this is a very unique and you know there are a lot of mediums out there and [noise]\nBut uh woodworking with her as she comes up with some amazing stuff in in a trance channel courses as those skills the crap out of those people who see it so uh yeah I you know I definitely she believes she is some type of ability [noise]\nDo you run across a lot of people like her in what you do\nThat and I use my diligence medium\nLots of mediums lots of all\nMean and we you know I also do a lot of studies for instance in the physical medium ship is as something that's always fascinated me and and cause for those who don't know there are two types of a medium ship mental mania ship or a disparate speaks\nYou Goldberg in that the movie ghost\nThat well that's a tension medium and and but uh that's still that the spirit works through a medium versus a physical medium ship which the spirit comes into our around\nAnd also show on there and I read you a pontoon boat cruise now there's beautiful Alabama River and all that go on social you know down here in Hungary income so we're going to be looking for [noise]\nOh\nChevrolet Master control center this is W.

were designed so that they could eliminate the medium because people wanted to go directly and that's kind of what these electronic devices doing there there are trying to get the goes tons of a deal directly which for it and not have to go through a meeting or not\nHave to you know almost on demand type of thing but it yeah I mean there are there are some\nUm\nBetter pieces equipment up there and there are some that then of course but you know there's nothing wrong with the good thermal imaging camera or a good I I Can't remember a a good record\nAnd marine how 'bout you will technology you know change things\nUm you know I honestly don't think the technology has reached the point that makes it more sensitive than human being you know and then what we can fans ourselves I mean we may be getting close with some areas that they're now they're finding out but honestly I don't think it's sensitive enough yet\nSo you're not going to be replaced by a robot ghost investigator anytime\n[laughter] I don't I don't think I'm All right let's go into a final call\nHe seems Florida bill's with us and bill are you in a safe haven there ... hurricane headed your way\nOr the other side of the state we're south of St Augustine so I think we're uh we're probably going to be safe on this one\nOkay let's pray that everybody else is going to do\nIt a ghost story for you or when we came down here about eight years ago in Florida where you were at the paranormal investigation and the old Spanish military hospital in Plano against theme which is known to be haunted\nAnd while we were there a ghost this was in the middle of the night and it goes to actually made the table move up on the second floor so we went up to the second floor and we were able to communicate with the ghost wife Susan and I\nAnd some other people that were there and we are we any um any man flashlight on a table and that goes to go to answer our questions by making the light blinked\nAnd so ... gave various questions and a to Z and got it to indicate that its name was Murray and then it was a was a been a nurse at a at the hospital at one time during the Spanish period\nCheese on ... and up at the time my Andy am I in a briefcase with me and I was carrying around a large amount of money and then subsequently um for about the next year so little time to time I would hear clicking noises that goes with teasing me that he was opening briefcase\nI Love it now while I'm On for a while would happen is um if I drop like little auto camp falls off the chair or something um last last about I'm not last July but the one before that\nIn the middle of the night when it happened a little plane bottle camp or something so I find that the chair\nAnd it's fun and like a high percentage speed for\nWhy are they mischief makers Ron ... what are they trying to accomplish by plane around like that\nSometimes the the just the tension seekers they they just want to be seen or heard other words that you know where I Am have to pay attention to if you have a a cat for instance the cats are pretty much like that to a you know they'll they'll come in and do silly things to\nDo with what you know they're there and have pay attention to me so I I think that's that's primary it\nBut uh I have to tell a funny story about the book I went to my next door neighbor and ... and the\nNext day I came back I met her and she came back with the book and she said here take it back she says we were reading the or the first chapter and I was having a glass of wine and my glass shattered\nOh so she says I don't want anything to do with it [laughter] it's like glass shattering books his ears and the other interesting thing to do anything really what they want to do I believe text and tweets Tom what do you have a this went in from Sarah in Rochester I'm curious to\nRun or and Maureen can recommend ways to prevent ... from coming to a person's life ... into someone's life let's give that to you more unit\nOkay so I think given me the wrong one [laughter]\nWe'll get along really well yeah yeah\nSee I'm honestly I'm a big believer with that with St Michael so I Know me from the things one is intention if you you know here I'm looking for that and you're believing that evils coming into their life and you know it's very possible that you're you couldn't find it in\nUm the other thing is I print 'cause I have a granddaughter who is you know too young to do that sort of thing but she's picking up spiritually she thinks they're already\nThat I put underneath you know her mattress and in her pillow and I have different varying crystals around the room for how ... when the ... um and she's doing a lot better so I Know you know and again it's a belief right so I Believe it works\nOn its intention networks I think if you believe in yourself as well and you can tend to have bought out bought out\nMost times what'd you say you were on what about it\nI I agree with it away and and you judge 'cause you talk about the the hurricane and your intention sure make it yeah so and tensions as a hundred percent but being a good old Catholic boy I rely on my religion the costs and so that's that's what I always recommend [noise]\nYou know and I've seen this happen before I've seen hurricanes go from a category four down to uh to down to one yeah and you know who's to sea prayer is the cause but hey you know what it works\nYeah crank Korea hundred percent with the judge\nTo take it any way we can let's go to bill in Idaho west of the Rockies Hi Bill go ahead\nDawn okay to say first

been working behind me off I hate and try to be nice\nI'm working really hard and it's time to kind of read some of those benefits and actually to move forward um obviously I Can't tell you what to do

back to coast to coast mark ... with us author partner at the sherpas technology group in Silicon valley former investment banker with UPS in New York His world view has been turned upside down in the late to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing sites\n... consciousness has not produced by the brain now after researching extensively he wrote this book in the end the upside down thinking to introduce all of us to these cutting edge ideas and their views on coast to coast I've got this really shocked you wouldn't usually marked isn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me and thank you for having me on\nWhile I'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of gas scientists and\nPeople who are experts on the brain\nDoes consciousness exist outside of the brain or not know the pure scientists to the medical professional folks mark would always say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness of the brain dies it all goes with it\nAnd I've always thought no there's something else here with consciousness you finally found out did you\nI did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the materialist science camp which suggests that the universe is fundamentally made of matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago filling the universe with physical material that we call matter\nAnd when you have enough matter in this big universe you're bound to get interactions between those pieces of matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're ... you're bound to end up with a self replicating molecule like DNA chance says that would happen and DNA leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that the perspective\nAnd if you buy into that which I used to and then when the brain dies\nConsciousness dies memories are gone than when you think about meaning in life if you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one of the dead there is no memories there is no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned in science and most of science today\nKnow looking at your ... I Would lose money in a bet saying that you would write a book about consciousness showing the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter]\nSo it was about two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally materialist that's what I Would call it now in hindsight\nUh but I I randomly stumbled across a cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had\nAnd at the end of it her name is Laura Powers\nShe mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers and I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula\nAnd I listen to different episodes and people there were many different people who talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities ability for consciousness to survive bodily debt things I had no familiarity with\nAn overtime just hearing enough different people describing similar perspectives on reality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real\nAnd this was a very jarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless and here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that process is consciousness and the identity that we have is not tied to the body so\nThat totally freaked me out [laughter] and uh changed my world you're completely led me down the path of intense research because I needed to rethink all reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in financing consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends overtime at first I was kind of afraid to tell people\nI got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with the topics\nAre men and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight\nSo after hearing enough of this feedback and also saying that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend and I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco\nAnd decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days and ended up writing more than half of the book that's now out and then finished over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript\nAnd ultimately a ice cold email bill Gladstone who's now my agent at my publisher multiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents Eckhart totally\n... cheaper Neal Donald Walsh um and so that's where we are\nA super now what do you mean by an end to upside down thinking\nI consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness [laughter]\nWhat I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing beyond space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness consciousness comes first\nWell right without the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests no word science back us up\nTo my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine\nOr I talk about near death experiences and if you'd asked me a few years ago with a near death experience I Would have said well isn't that just a loose nation that happens when someone's about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described in the near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as a vertical out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back into their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that is suggestive of some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark ... bird dot com is linked up for you and coast to coast am dot com the name of his book we're talking about an end to upside down thinking let me read the subtitle dispelling the myth that the brain produces consciousness\nAnd the implications for everyday life we are going to take phone calls next hour with mark and I'm going to come back we'll talk with them about\nSilicon nieces pretty cognition Gillette but see how that all works out side of the brain and what's causing [noise]\nThe numbers it's great to show up dates you didn't connecting with other than go to preschool dot com slash coast to coast am and click through my book [noise]\nA great question I'm often asked that I Would say yeah they were very dry here that are but I think at like hope people about the evidence but I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before to lump it the pretty cognition tell like as a cycle and he says you you of course we learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nIt absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics on science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on the topic and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about ... what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt that way who was a a psychiatrist at the time devoted\nAnd uh she came she came out with some astounding things but when did you find\nIt yeah it's a lot but he's a very important phenomenon it's it's mine too mine communication and just taking a quick step back\nThe reason that I examine each of these phenomenon is that I reason that\nThe material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain that perspective cannot account for things like ... the and the other things will talk about and I reason that if any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work\nSo well apathy\nTo me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns held experiments and the basic design is as follows and I should say that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you combine the results\nThe statistics are very compelling mhm doctor dean rating who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma\nSix sigma refers to statistical odds against chance when you get a six sigma resolve the odds of that the effect has just happening by chance is more than a billion to one and in telepathy we have six sigma results\nSo the guns thought experiment the study has one person in her room we'll call him Bob and very very relaxing state listening to relaxing music\nThere's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room chain is given a picture by the experimenter as an experimenter say Jane I Know that sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally send a picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room so Jane is mentally sending this image to Bob\nBob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture jam was looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all that Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent right\nThat wouldn't be the ... the law probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent\nSo from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically it suggests that something is getting through and it actually conforms to our common sense our everyday experience because if we were one hundred percent tell a path that then we would know each other's thoughts all the time\nYou're instead it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they text you where they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase ... percent mark is at the center or the receiver\nIs this something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a have had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better meditate or ... seem to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI've always wondered though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events without really having the sender heavy much to do with it\nI think that's a receiver might have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... ethic or communications with the deceased through medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information and if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a conscious\nThey can figure they're antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver the person in the room and simply not show them any of them for pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she sent to them what do you think would happen\nWell well I think we'd have a distribution first of all we had an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic then we'd probably get some\nSome pretty strong cats and that's what we saw with the U.S government uh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies and the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me on the program is sometimes referred to as the Stargate program used psychic pies or national security purposes\nMany of ... been on this show by the way\nUp during the Cold War and and the people who have more involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many remote viewers who are involved to say this was ... so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real I'm In\nMy book I I have some documents from the CIA which had been declassified recently\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was won by remote viewing is the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being they're physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that's far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes\nIt sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain but if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable\nDocument um say explicitly and I I'm looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon\nThis is from a classified document that has been released recently [laughter] so I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that in my business world if I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me at least made me question things\nUm even further than that there's eight page on science panel and there are some very credible people including a someone from Cal Tech\nThe next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes implications are revolutionary evidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we have the looked at these uh tell a path ... studies and I've always wondered\nIf the government really never stopped doing it but continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies that just that same question and they say no it stopped because they would have kept us on they would have used us I'm not sure\nWhat the government has found other people and they've continued these kinds of mine studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for\nExample former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used to find a downed Russian calmer in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether\nIt was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes\nIt was useful so you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that a organizations would be trying it\nPretty cognition mark\nBecause of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them now a lot of people don't react they don't do it in something happens and they go oh I should have done that I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies which show a very subtle pre cognition known as pre sentiment where the bodies sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to ... to show it before something happens\nAnd there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream known as a ... dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly they dreamed it that much less subtle but if we go to the pre sentiment studies this is where I think it becomes very compelling again if we look at the meta analysis of all the statistics\nThat basic

my life but I have been on my own a tremendous amount of time I'm at a deep thinker\nSpiritual and I think I'm an empathetic person so I wanted to know these qualities allow people to be more tell a

chew on the clock I'm thinking important messages you know something important in your life seeing these signs so I kinda think that it's all intertwined and then just one more thing um\nYou know a while ago someone had told me\nI'm In the spirit and this whole are actually different I I Believe and maybe a Bible or some religion if it's the body and mind stare at all and so I kinda think that what you're saying is differentiating\nBetween this it's like the spirit or the ... all of the person is is it's outside in the spirit inside or [laughter] or either or but um I I kinda think of it on a spiritual level what you're saying as well\nI Would think more birds initial maybe one in the say what do you think\nIt thank you for your question Monique um I tend to agree with you George and there's an algae I Love also from Dr Bernardo Castro which summarizes the way I think about things\nWhich is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness and each of us is like a whirlpool within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we are fundamentally still made out of water so what happens when the physical body dies\nThat's like a world will dissipating and the water doesn't leave the stream it just transitions into a different state\nAnd so the water to me of consciousness and consciousness is having this Friday of experiences whether localized in the ... or otherwise industry\nDo you think the consciousness\nIs a normal process of living or it's super natural\nThe way I view consciousness is that it's like ... he said I regard consciousness as fundamental regard matter as to rebut of from consciousness meaning that consciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things points to that\nBasically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow has this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to a leads to a very bleak outlook on life once your brain docket Dover\nI mean I understood the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching um now I think that that consciousness does not died when the body dies because of the consciousness isn't dependent on the body\nSo I see much more uh meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish that had been taught me a long time ago but going back to the near death experiences what people often report is known as a life revealed\nWhere they experience their whole life in a flash and again this is when their brain as either offer highly impaired\nAnd they're judging themselves for how they acted during their life but this is the kicker that really I think about this every day is that some people report experiencing the life review through the eyes of those they affected\nSo let's say Bob harm to change in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experience the pain through chains eyes\nAnd he comes back to his life forever changed carrying much more about uh how we treat people rather than material goods so it when we talk about meeting in life life review as a potential lens if we take that as a literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given this gift to be able to do these incredible things\nThrough consciousness cognition telepathy and things like\nThat well yeah I think that these are natural abilities that we tend to have in the telepathy study I mentioned earlier where people are thirty two percent rather than twenty five percent there's a subtle ability even ... and people who aren't trained\nI think their abilities that are just simply not harness in modern society because these ideas are considered a novelist and totally paranormal and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book itself so compelled to do it is that\nAn understanding human potential and these abilities that we have could revolutionize I think the world but also our science and our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do\nFirst time caller John in Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\nYou doing sir

six and Iraq\nWere by the way to preserve it for ...\nCase that I was assigned to an empty every intelligence unit\nAnd we basically we're looking for a bomb maker um we were able to use what I understand it the remote viewing from a section of yes three intelligent shop where there was a coal location for a boss and some building we were able to find that three you Avi ...\nAnd the person I Believe who was the remote viewer there was brought in was bald and I believe he was an albino\nWhich is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli descent from\nI can get of who I dealt with over there my question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in the remote viewing because of his I guess you would say non English or non American\nUp I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a ...\nYeah ...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\n\nI Would say that what what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to proceed something with the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our eyes outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the world or an allergy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they are localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water that outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us you know sir ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's

to coast our final segment with Margo ... market can we concluded that consciousness is a part of the universe always was\nAnd that it survives outside of the physical brain than physical body but it's there it's out there in the ether I mean can we categorically all agree on that\nTo me the evidence point in that direction more strongly than any other direction when you put together the phenomenon that we discussed tonight a psychic phenomena like till after the psycho can eat as pre cognition\nNear death experience as children with at like memories when you put all these together combined with certain phenomena of quantum physics\nIt gets that consciousness is playing this fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the bird ...\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your show until a blessing you thanks wonderful really wonderful and my ah my question is do you can get other got tons of cars a reincarnation as a result of consciousness living outside the body and each of us\nSo it can be a consciousness moves on to affect another human being good or evil out free will play a part in or a fact consciousness and I'll take my reply on rent\nFree will have anything to do with a mark\nIs is a very tricky question I think the question of free will get ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking out that had the free well\nUm are we talking about the body having free will are we talking about the consciousness itself and if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water and then all there is is conscious\nSo at the level of the fundamental conscious now it would appear that there is a infinite pre well but at the level of perhaps ... an individual that is considering it it'd be separated from\nThat way then perhaps the free world does not exist at the same level that that make that\nYeah it does it on a very difficult subject\nIt's very difficult and I think there are some of the concept that we are talking about night I think are beyond what our linear human mind can conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know in in ... there can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concepts that our brains just limit us from understanding finally\nDid you think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and da da da da da da da and the ...\nI I think there were probably people throughout history\nUm who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how Jesus might've interplay with consciousness but from the pieces I I've heard it's possible that he was one of these individuals who really understood\nHow things work and it seems when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nWe have a guest his name's Joseph gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he is conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of the doubt\nThat the ability of the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose and his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested and in the end he said it's uncanny so if somebody goes into Las Vegas upbeat positive\nUh there's a high likelihood they're going to win but if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results are uncanny\nI think that's all tied together like consciousness it's all part of the same don't you I\nAm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just stay at a country is the basis of reality where everything is just the stream of consciousness then the reality we're in is almost malleable\nAnd sometimes very subtle where you have a random number generator that's behaving slightly non randomly in other cases we have reports like he talked about a metal being and using the mind so who's to say that outcomes which is just a part of the physical reality could also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a cello James\nUh is real quickly before a make my favorite I like the a prospect of this disagree with ah that ah eighth is a bill
