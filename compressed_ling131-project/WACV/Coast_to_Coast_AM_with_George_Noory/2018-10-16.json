studies that show that home with your family is now where you're born ... really do determine where you end up in life\nYou see this all the time I get highly myself for heart fast city resident\nAnd even though a lot of us in the city have different backgrounds and circumstances there still good people in the city but they just can't seem to get ahead and this would lead me to my second question\nOf people really have a hard time just visualizing where they might end up and then I Want to bring up the horrendous\nCar crash in school here in New York We're ...\nOr ...\nI ... I was reading some of their ... and many enough of these people were truly professional in their lives you know one\nBecause there was evidence before the crash of something bad was about to happen I Know myself I Would have spoken up and said get me out of this that crap\nBut these those people Mr Horwitz of the upper middle class the all basically we remained mom no one spoke up their their very lives were coming to an end\nAnd yet you say a from a higher exalted background that people should know but the ... they were like many people and society they\nThey were conditioned to stay quiet and it ended up costing there ... there were twenty people killed Eighteen in a limo no one spoke up to say\nThis has got to stop pull over now and they could have but they didn't like sheep to say it they went to their deaths\nSort of wrap all of this up um whether me in the city and seen my fellow city residents ... many of them good enough but not getting ahead and then in school Harry these upper middle class people not speaking up for themselves\nI'd like you to tide us together and so far as why to say it if I have to like cheap so many people go to their doom and they just can't bring themselves to grant themselves by their lapels and just speak up for themselves and say gosh darn\nJust let all of this that and let us all come together and do something about it\nAnd she let me let me ask you because we have the story the night it happened it was a tragedy for sure but what do you mean by to tell somebody to stop what was going on inside that bloom all ...\nAre there indications that the car was basically deemed my term coming apart the uh people were saying uh amongst the victims because they had cell phones that we can't we can't even hear each other next to each other or talk to the\nCar was being Colombian very noisy and and literally coming apart at the scenes\nAnd you would think that intelligent people and many enough uh for both of you these were quite professional people would noticeably higher middle class a job where they should have had the smart the know how\nThe driver to pull over and I know because you've heard me before me keep that driver would have pulled over no ...\nI would've wanted to be in that limo would you you would have stopped that guy\nYou know ... there's a lot to unpack and we'll keep is saying and of course I I read that same news coverage now you know there's a new age expression there are no accidents and I break with that expression I don't I don't abide\nBy that everything happens for a reason\nRight right one of the things that are right in the book\nIs you know as I've been alluding we live under many laws enforces we experienced many laws in forces and I've never including love accident including accidents birth for example now peer pressure as as Keith was looting\nIs an extremely powerful force then it can be a destructive force one must never get caught up in peer pressure because it can be a kind of group mentality regardless of whether it holds you too where you've been born or it keeps you from speaking up if you're seeing something that you think is dangerous\nIt's vitally vitally important that everybody acts with independent agency that doesn't mean you can escape accidents that doesn't mean you could escape tragedy but my contention is\nThat the mind is one vital element that participates\nThat participates in other things\nThat are going on and it is extremely important\nTo exercise it at all times you're never without devices whether you're facing a crisis or based on the accident of birth and economic class I Can't tell you and I would never tell anyone that there aren't crushing forces socially and economically there\nAre but the fact is the mind is one vital tool in your belt that you can always use\nAnd it can make all the difference at a crucial moment it is one thing we think of ourselves as having mines that control cognitive and motor function and that's true but there's more to it than that there's more to it that that the mind is extra physical properties and it doesn't mean that it necessarily determines everything\nAnd every force that occurs or comes into her life but it's one vital tool and my messages\nUse it use it always and everywhere and in every circumstance whether its environment\nAs Keith was alluding to or whether it's a situation that you think is going to be hazardous never feel bound by peer pressure there is no more blunt force of your own will ineffectiveness in potency than peer pressure it must be escaped\nLet's go to ... in California now I'm going to\nCharge thank you for taking my call very up beat interview was hearing gal or I'm very grateful affect you and ... comment and question I'd like to share a miracle short you know I regularly listen to an audio program in which you match\nNarrate her nap audio program as level God or it's more it's all year round you know and\nI Hope you write about ...

kinds of things he's using the power the mind\nIt's absolutely crazy there was a Harvard study and George this is the God's honest truth and I get the details and the miracle club is a Harvard a clinical psychologist named Ellen Langer she did a study on hotel maids\nShe found that if she explained to hotel maids the fact that their jobs are actually robotically an anaerobic Lee healthy and then studied the maids for six weeks compared to a control group who had been told nothing\nShe found the group that had been educated about the aerobic benefits of their jobs\nActually lost weight they didn't do anything differently they were just in that you needed to realize that their jobs or anaerobic Lee aerobic Lee healthy they lost weight and their blood pressure were lowered just

with Mitch Horwitz as we talk about his work the miracle club the books available for you and we'll get to your calls as well fascinating work much and what's even greater about all this it really does work\nIt really does work you know I always tell people that would never give somebody an exercise that I hadn't road to that and I treat every reader as I Would a member of my own family every single method technique exercise in this book is something that I Would give to my own kids to use it really does work\nWe briefly touched on your thoughts about people going back into time in order to help their current life how do you do that\nYou know George it's simple as just focusing mentally on what for example you might want to tell your younger self that's something that the ... to us we often think of that as novelties so it's easy to picture\nI made the determination I read about this and the final chapter of the miracle club at once I had come to feel that linear time was basically an illusion and everything is happening infinitely and all at once\nIf you can actually enter into a relax meditative state and picture of yourself into the scene going back\nGiving advice to younger self whatever age maybe you want to avert a tragedy or disaster maybe want to dispense a piece of advice\nIt can change your life right here and now in the present but be careful because sometimes things that we experience\nAs challenges or tragedies also bring maturity to her life they also bring refinement to her life so you don't necessarily want to raise something that was a difficulty because that might have been a springboard for some sort of greater maturity or lesson so reflect very very carefully on what you want to tell your younger self\nAnd then imagine yourself into that\nScene imagine yourself in that scene write down what you want to tell your younger self because by writing it down you'll be able to actually have some sort of a compass point or vantage point from when you can tell whether things are different and I think you will find that things will be different\nWhy do you say that it could be dangerous to do that\nWell because if we go back and we are race adverse cities we could be a racing something that taught us a vital or necessary lessons from times the aspects of our lives that were most proud\nThese so we want to be very careful this is not a game this is not a toy is not something to play around with you want to be really sure that whatever the consequence\nYou want to go back and encourage your younger self to do something healthy unimportant and productive but don't think of it as just avoiding tragedy because tragedy can actually be a springboard to maturity\nNow here's the sixty four thousand dollar question Mitch yeah so how does it work\nOut does it work that is the question and I don't shy from that question the fact is\nI don't think we manifest things I think we select things\nI think as in the particle lab everything in our lives is in super position and it becomes localized only when we focus on it as if we are almost drawing up a matrix grid and when we isolate a spot or point in time on that grid we experience it as being as vividly real\nAs my voice that you're hearing right now so our actual act of life is an act of selectivity what we emotionally and mentally picture rise and focus upon is the experience that we enter into because everything is happening at once and we go in and out of these things\nThe way a particle goes from a wave state and then it collapses into a localized particle state\nSelect very carefully time is infinite\nAnd our minds our sensory tools are a measuring device by which we can help decide exactly what we're going to experience\nLet's go to Barry in Rock Hill
