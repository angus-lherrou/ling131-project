going to tell us tonight we might be able to get through some of this\nI Will get through and I sure hope so I I have ever competed what do you think of Amazon crushing bricks and mortar stores [noise]\nAnd you know crashing because the Amazon or you know online retail is about ten percent of total retail if not crushing anything\nIt said it shares was kind of an anachronism anyway you know the ... the the retailer that are having problems right now are having problems because they're having you know their their their model is not correct that because of Amazon\n... do you think they should have adjusted that they could have prevented some of the things that have happened to them like toys R. us and all the other places\nOh yeah oh for sure [laughter] you know it's always makes me crazy you know I I saw this um [noise] um [noise] you know but if you follow toys are us on in the wall Street Journal and in you know it's it's actually gone now and now a metallic a higher there for the c._e._o.\nIn four years for the c._e._o. and for years\nUps to a reverse the the sales decline of of a hot wheels and Barbie dolls\nYou know what the real problem is it what what they say and they are you know I read the wall Street Journal article just a few months ago\nThat said that ah kids now are so enthralled with their phones the iPhones that they're no longer a ... you know they no longer have any consideration for hot wheels are Barbie dolls\nOr the real problem is there are fewer kids about twenty five percent fewer kids under ten now and there were ten years ago he I think maybe just maybe that has something to do with their ... their sales decline\nIt could be it makes me\nCrazy and you know I was seriously Georgia if you've ever twenty five percent decrease in the size of beer market I don't care if your if your General Motors or or Amazon or your ... you know your sales are going to decline it it they're just they weren't born they don't exist\nOr [noise] you know they do but how do you look into a crystal ball can make these predictions if you're running a business\n... ... ... ... what you do is is it the what's the most important question for any business a business you know I I I was a ...\nI had an opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officers in the hospitality industry about two years ago and and everyone was there ... ... a share tumors their Hilton was there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do was was the the hospitality industry\nAnd they asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and I'm In the ... you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room and it was about twelve people in the room and sitting around and round table\nAnd and they eat their answer\nWas you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise hundred market on social media\nAnd and the American express said we have to get into the hands we have to we have to understand this new generation y A N you know how they think how they buy and Hilton says it's it's about new products are about making your room smaller in your lobbies bigger\nYou know what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics as\n... as it because if you are market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market but he you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their products fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand\nAnd all of a sudden sales started trailing off is was Nineteen\nNinety eight [noise] and I and I said I'm\nSo your your sales are ... are are going flat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as to the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis and and I said a Hoosier customer and they set an Eighteen the thirty four year old man and woman Eighteen to thirty four and I said what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he said well we could they don't fit in the product anymore\nI said you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where do you come up with and he said it was a pause and he said\nNineteen Ninety eight and I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nHe said what does that mean as I said what that means is you know you're you're laughing gas just checked out of your hotel and their their sales went from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while we're because they're not paying attention to demographic\nYou know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out\n... ... people and you will understand\nWell is it is simple to Ken to talk to that demographic you need to go after eventually and find out some of the things they enjoy and look at those trends and you find out that you know if there are kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people\nFind out from them what did they do what are they like where did they go do they go to movies do they not and then adjust yourself to that\n[laughter] drugs are too smart [laughter] but but it doesn't that sound like like logic yeah common sense is not so common ... said that\nLike you know I I Do um [noise] I'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and they say that's the boomers everybody can see that the boomers all sat down\nAnd I'll say okay if you were born before Nineteen eighty five sit down and ... and another large group sits down and and I say that's Jenn ... about three people standing\nAnd I said this that Gen Y that Gen Y or the millennials are born Nineteen eighty or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them\nI said you want to know about the new market you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here and it makes me crazy\nWell it's ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed you know what's happening is that what's happening to like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing genius says something slipping\nI Know you don't you want to tell people I'm McDonald same story sales are off you know there there are all of their increases are coming from um their overseas operation\nI I I I tell folks I said listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children\nI said and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years as I said you ought to three ends of of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is mc Donald's famous for its not the tradition and no it's it's for French\nFries garden listen to what they tried to say heart people have the impression that it's not nutritional food\n[noise] it's an exact like correct and and so that's that's their problem they they are if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food\nUh in in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell food food he can't tell you you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts\nWhat's going on with population trends are are they shifting down to [noise]\n[noise] yeah well you know it it's funny you say that a\n... in Nineteen ... if if we we have a new generation is called Generation Z and Generation Z started in a two thousand five and they will they will be a a they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet [noise]\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we ... we have four million a three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier [noise] ah\nWhat's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies a year and and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend can stay with us we'll talk more about trends\nCoast to coast day I'll get Daily Show updates right to your inbox for pre with the coast so newsletter sign up today at coast to coast am dot com\nThere and welcome back and they're gone back with us as we talk about trends the incredible trends that the I guess Ken nachos businesses should be using things like this I Would guess anybody who's doing something marketing you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely it does [noise] it it is mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't think about this because it precipitating it's almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\nWell it has to a large degree um\nThe [noise]\nYou know and what what I tell people when when I asked me a question like that people are still people when when you have a large number of people\nThat are consumer a specific product in a small number of people are consumer product the large number of people would consume more though I Know that sounds were mentoring but the the the smartphone\nAs a only aged folks and their ability to consume so uh it's it's a good thing\nMind that the thing that drives commerce of the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nThat that's the that's simple isn't it\n... it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it I mean I'm ... I mean ... who is out there saying well okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume smaller amounts of stuff\nBut if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause the the uh let me give you an example if you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers\nAre Twenty years ago in in vast quantities\nAnd then the the um [noise] um the automobile companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing departments that have kept on firing their\nTheir chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with the secret to selling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation and now you find that I can be for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to me a couple of days ago and she said pop I you know\nKids are age you know what she calls herself are cute but she's a young woman now we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and in you know it it's funny 'cause I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born outside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of a of a marriage um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture [noise] uh where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside of the the uh\nMarriage ... it's just it's a different time George\n... now if you could understand that so whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you effect change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do in right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do\nJust like the uh uh you know you go back to forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies with the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the to a sex drugs and rock and roll what happens in the ... the boomer hippies\nLive became Republicans\nIn all cases\n[laughter] no not at all cases but you know if if you look if you look at [noise] that this this is ... ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise] [noise] ah [noise]\nThe ages right now I'm thirty four fifty three we have a diminutive puppy a population of of indigenous people that were born here they were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four\nBetween forty five sixty four [noise] what does that mean that means that that that particular population could not a support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nUm superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be where where did that with ... you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is a you know ... ... ... instead of having a you know ... ... and they should have haves and have nots with with a cushion in between\nOf generation X we don't because they were never born\nWe're losing that cushion yeah well what we did in ... so ... you'd have people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have the have nots but middle age and and I'm and\nI'm middle income uh our occupy exactly the same space so if you're middle ages small and then your middle income as small as well [noise] but it's a demographic issue it was just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this too I mean let let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got the billions of people on line or they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially\nBut I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to there's becoming a change there were I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting the bank for a dollar a year or two for converting these into sales\nBecause the market may not be what we really want to what's happening without\nA Facebook is kind of strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks listen if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product\nUm as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got a Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry the Internet are um advertising is a bottomless pit you have no idea what your pie none and there's no way\nTo a reference any kind of success except return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet and and ah he just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up your sales go up you you don't know if it's if it's\nA relative to how much money you spend on the Internet [laughter] but uh what what's happening with a a ... a enterprise there is is not good it really is\nI mean it's huge but there's a trend here and to me the trend is very negative so that it\nIs involved in what's negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous I I don't trust 'em a Facebook at all I I really don't I don't think I I think to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed\nAnd then the ... and and that analysis put people into categories and those categories are are sellable [noise]\nAnd and what a sucker bird does with that information is sell it to anybody who pay for it so there there's there's there's no security and anything that you put on Facebook nothing\nAnd well what about you know some of these whack jobs you know the idiot that killed eleven people in the Jewish synagogues ... the guy who sends out these bombs\nSocial media to kind of spelled their hatred or how can we can't catch them a little sooner\nYou tell me I I really don't know that Robert powers in in a a Caesar salad and they're they're truly whacked jobs and um I don't know that that's that's more um a\nMore understanding of of of a of a psych uh graphics than a demographics as far as I'm concerned\nKen what's happening in the housing market most younger people aren't buying houses they're renting what's gonna happen\n[noise] while they're renting because they had a trillion dollars of student\nLoan debt yeah [noise]\nYeah but don't worry about it\nNow what we're what we're literally facing with um a kids is is you have eighty seven million kids that are between fourteen and thirty three years old the kids are finally moving out of their parents' basements they're throwing loyal as trophies they don't deserve\nThe good some group five five one zero two to five or email me a bogus at charter dot net that's five five one zero two to five call now\nChevrolet

have a ... you know then\nAnd now there's just an information explosion basically people pick and choose a their information or even at a professional level ... want to emphasize in the sense that if you look at chip and\nPeople used to like Twenty years ago the people just work twenty four seven almost a year and\nIt just hasn't worked out of individual level in Japan for people with that high octane a drive to a stay at the office to them that night or whatever [noise]\nAh so maybe they're lacking creative conscious something my second question will be about Amazon ah\nI Know they get criticized putting out small for prior to send I can understand that but at the same time this stuff you can find on there that you can find locally even even in New York for example I got I got this great gloves shoveling my neighbors snow\nAnd that's the main thing I Need it but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota [noise]\nI'd go for the first question again [laughter] ... inside just blowing on Long Island and I'm from Long Island too but what was the first question go ahead and give us an office again Joe\nJoe\n... says for example and explosion and video ... you know like half of everything people get on a small and fall and I think of as video based just how should people it's\nWorld just pick and choose how they consume information or to emphasize because it doesn't necessarily work out to put this plan that for them to do something whether it's just so so much of the nation like it like a carnival of sand on on the ... what good does it do that ... it's just too overwhelming\nThought where's your insurance requires a lot of information\nThat we get as it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if I'm a ... a lot of aid that the Gen Y kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you can ask them simple questions about you know what's going on in the world and they can't answers\nBut ... how do you sift through this what you have to do is you have to compare several sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I really don't\nCome to any kind of conclusions unless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with information\nAnd in terms of Amazon I think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we open the Internet we opened up the world we we just that was our view to the innards of the world\nAnd I think what's what's going down with Amazon is just something that's naturally transpiring and I think if you're just going to get nothing but bigger you're going to see commerce is going to change everything about commerce is going to change\nThat we've done a company that ships radios they make radios and they make darn good radio secretive company and I I used to get my radio from them long before I started doing this show\nAnd it was simple you you go on line you order what you want it's delivered to your house in some cases it's free shipping based on the deal that they've got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money on gasoline you don't have to find a crowd it's ... it's it's amazing that's amazing I mean\nIt's infinitely easier when you look at the boomers what how do you do business with a boomer you save them some time you make their life easy and you don't rip them off this was perfect and so Amazon is is is going to do nothing but a grow\nOn you know and that online retail ... will exceed the ten percent where it is now is probably go to twenty percent thirty percent\nI think so too they hurt brick and mortar but I mean the the the goods are still being manufactured um the Amazon employees zillion people um some awards complain about their job they're\nMore conditions and things like that but I mean they're they're hired people so there's displacement so when the bricks and mortar stores go really the only big thing to get hurt and you know some people are out of work but they can find jobs elsewhere\nIt's the real estate that just sits there what's gonna happen with that stuff\nThat's a good question you know I Know that the um commercial real estate is you know ... you know suffering some issues right now some serious issue\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall\nRight about now no no no but but but I certainly would buy residential you would I Would buy residential every day of the week yeah seller rent out\nYes [laughter] yeah no in fact I'm you know I I have a house in them but neither Springs Florida and and I and I have a house in in ... Connecticut and I'm\nIn the house and had him Connecticut's four thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just rattle around in it and what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it or we're gonna come up with an executive rental forward and and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses and people will come into all areas that don't want ... got to be very big\nYes and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and they ... solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nAre really they're very happy ... well yeah I Would I Would subscribe to that\nWhat you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're gonna see dramatic changes\nOne of the things that that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and that that's going to remain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force\nThat essentially demanded a you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had is a very young right now in just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them ...\n... oh yeah K. juicy direct dot com K.

I came on the air and stopped and Julie yes and it's on the email is still there um hopefully you'll get to watch sometimes when you were going to put me in touch with a local media\nOkay I'm really ... I wanted to ask your opinion about VP\nAnd um I actually have this is the first probably George from coast to coast I have an actual recording of an easy the last about two or three seconds and I want your opinion on this one here when you go\nOh\nThey are a ... a\nPretty scary found yeah\nIt's a weird so what do you think it sounds\nWell they're recording the voice of God and my mom's bedroom um I've got an old fashioned tape recorder and there are little ... run for about two hours every night\nAnd it's been very quiet they require overheard a would check the outlets to see if there was shorts or anywhere my sister and I and there's not I actually have to these recordings in front of the ... if he writes apart\nIt's really bizarre actually out here and I can't explain it um\nBruce what about you what do you think about ... BP's well uh\nYeah so um electronic voice phenomena um I I I think that they can be very helpfully because the ... the folks in the spirit world that are residing there we'll we'll try just about any way to get a hold of us especially their loved ones\nUh I hear all I've heard all kinds of stories you know that sometimes they'll uh items will be misplaced for a while and then all of a sudden show up in a very unique location to you know to give you a sign\nThat that they're there and that they want to connect with you and I think the voice phenomena could also be a a you know something like that that they're that they're trying to reach out and and and that is what I encountered when I Do this walking meditation is\nThat they desperately they desperately want to connect with their loved ones and pass on messages and sometimes it's very sometimes it's kinda sad sometimes it's a you know regrets too which is a very sad thing\nBut uh often times it's just messages of love and and you know they're they're okay not to worry about them anymore\nAnd when do you mean by it could be said well\nI had this one experience where I connected with a lady had asked me if I could connect with her father I did\nA and I got some of the things you know you don't get everything right 'cause there's interference you know like with anything else yeah uh and uh I got some of the things right and then he told me and I sensed in him and sadness and kind of some like he had regrets and I said\nUh I sense that is that something you'd like to share\nWith me why you feel that way and he he said well no and I don't want you to tell her that I have this these feelings either\nAnd it was it was very hard for me because this lady was very much wanted to connect with their fathers or wanted to tell her but I I couldn't tell her and I am not going to say that the names or whatever but uh so\n... and sometimes it's not always you know rainbows and lollipops you know\nIt was was that emotional for you\nIt was it was very emotional I was sometimes they you know their messages make me new sometimes tears of joy sometimes in this case kind of I felt this man's sadness or in in the spirit world so I\nYou know it it's kind of a tough one I did not\nYou know relate that and I'm hoping that if I connect with them again that maybe he'll give me permission to help her understand what it is because I'm sure she's probably feeling the same thing and maybe it's an expressed by her and his ... his saying it might clear the air so to speak and maybe create a better connection and\nAnd of course we have hand breaks and leave bags to get those following leaves under control capital city ISIS located at thirty two Fifteen Taylor road Montgomery\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control centers visit W.

I had an opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officers in the hospitality industry about two years ago\nAnd and everyone was there see ... a share tumors there he'll turn was there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do is was the the hospitality industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and uh ... you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room and it was about twelve people in the room and sitting around and round table\nAnd and they eat their answer\nWas you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media\nAnd and American Express said we have to get into their heads we have to have to understand this new generation y I'm you know how they think how they buy and Hilton says it's it's about new products it's about making room smaller in your lobbies bigger\nNow what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it is all about ...\n... is is because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market but he you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their product fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand\nAnd all of a sudden sales started trailing off is was Nineteen\nNinety eight and I and I said um [noise]\nSo you're you're ... are ... and going flat and he said yeah what is it do we have a demographic issues as to the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis\nAnd and I said a Hoosier customer and he's got an Eighteen to thirty four year old man and woman Eighteen to thirty four and I said what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he said well we can they don't fit in the product anymore\nI said you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said it was a pause and he said\nNineteen Ninety eight and I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he said what does that mean as I said what that means is you know you're you're laughing gas just checked out of your hotel and their their sales went from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while we're not paying attention to demographic\nYou know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out\nBut if you want to understand where money came from it came from people how people and you will understand\nWell is it is simple to Ken to talk to that demographic you need to go after eventually\nAnd look at those trends and you find out that you know if there are kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people or find out from them what did they do what do they like where did they go did they go to the movies do they not and then adjusts yourself to that\n[laughter] if you're if you're too smart [laughter] but but you did that doesn't that sound like like logic yeah common sense is not so common volunteer said that\nLike you know I I Do um [noise] I'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and I say that's the boomers everybody you see that the boomers all sat down\nAnd I'll say okay if you are born before Nineteen eighty five sit down\nAnd ... and another large groups have found it and I say that's ... about three people standing and I said this that's Gen Y that Gen Y or the millennials are born Nineteen eighty or eighty five the two thousand for this eighty seven million of them\nI said you want to know about the new market you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here and it makes me crazy\nWell it's it's ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening is that what's happening like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing geniuses something slipping\nA you know you don't you don't want to tell people I'm McDonald's same story sales are off you know there ... all of their increases are coming from um their overseas operation ...\nI I I I tell folks I said listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children I said and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years\nAs I said you ought to three ends of of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is mc Donald's famous for its not nutrition and no it's it's for French fries\nNorton listen to what they tried to say heart\nPeople have the impression that it's not nutritional food\nIt's exactly correct and and so that's that's their problem they they are if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food\nOr it in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell the food you can't sell you you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts [laughter]\nWhat's going on with population trends are are they shifting down to [noise]\n[noise] yeah well you know it's funny you say that\nUh [noise] in Nineteen ... we we have a new generation is called Generation Z and Generation Z started in a two thousand five and they will they will be a a they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we ... we had four million a three hundred and sixteen thousand babies are born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier [noise]\nAh what's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies the here\nAnd and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend can stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next hour here on coast to coast they get Daily Show up the right to you\nSign up today it coast to coast am dot com\nBad welcome back and they're gone back with us as we talk about trends the incredible trends that the I guess can not just businesses should be using things like this I Would guess anybody who's doing something marketing you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely it does [noise] it it it's mysterious to me why everyone doesn't think about this because it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone changed these things\nWell it has to a large degree um\n... the\nKnow and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] if people are still people when when you have a\nA large number of people that are consumer or a specific product in a small number of people that consume a specific product the large number of people will consume more though I Know that sounds very meant tree but they ... the smartphone\nHas a only aged folks in their ability to consume so uh it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nBut you have to keep in mind that [noise] [noise] the thing that drives\nIs the number of people in the market period\nThat's ... that's simple isn't it\n... it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it but I'm ... I mean who who is out there saying well okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume smaller amounts of stuff [noise]\nBut ... I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause the the uh let me give you an example if you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities\nAnd then the the um [noise] um yeah I'm a bill companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to\nA generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing department said it kept on firing their\nTheir chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with this secret his selling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation and the fact that they can be for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to me a couple of days ago and she said pop I you know kids are age you know what she calls herself a kid but she's a young woman now we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it [noise]\nYeah and in you know it it's funny 'cause I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born in it and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born outside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of a of a marriage um marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture or where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside of the\nThe marriage it it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that so whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you effect change\n[laughter] [noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do and right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back to forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies with the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the to a sex drugs and rock and roll what happens in the ... the boomer hippies\nLive became Republicans\nIn all cases [laughter] no not at all cases but you know if if you look if you look\nAt [noise]\nThat this this is ... ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise]\nAh [noise] between the ages right now I'm thirty four and fifty three we have a diminutive puppy a population of of indigenous people that were born here\nThey were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five sixty four [noise] what does that mean\nA while I'll go oh\nWell like my mother taught me and of course you don't see the country is run by\nGolly don't Rio de requiring your perfect mobile employee Montgomery area hope on the dot com local job work\n\nChevrolet Master control center this is W.

little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but if he let them about what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that would in their punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I I don't know I I think what he has done is dignify or is it the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but\nYou know yeah uh and you know on one hand you got to defend yourself on the other how much do you hire yourself in it than just move on and say you know folks I already said it I'm done with it and ended up like that\nIt exactly George ... and and I respect the the um the criticism I really do of of ... my comment because when I stray outside of demography\nMy position on ... the ... and my ability to forecast what's next based on demography is based on a ... a very macro view a very thirty thousand foot view\nWhen it you know you asked me a question about the president I'm I made the comment about the president but that was really subjectivity on my part that I mean that's what I feel\nRight no I get it yeah 'cause I'm ... what's what's going to happen going forward it it is it right now we have a polarized country in the country is polarized\nJust like it was in the sixties and early seventies because we have a huge population of young people in a huge population of old people and in between there is a small population that does not offer\nThe the a position of either of those too so uh\nWell what I like about dating his remarks though is she's she said how she felt without screaming without putting you down for your views and that's what it's all about that's the way it should be\nExactly yeah so so my my comment today and it would be thank you for your position it's like for that yelling at me\n[laughter] let's go to zero in Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead I\nCan to question so it it talked about the wall Street Journal having more information than a ... and one issue than ... people have that\nAnd how the system that's amazing explosion basically people pick and choose a their information or even at a a professional level ... want to emphasize in the sense that if you look at you and people used to like\nTwenty years ago the people just work twenty four seven almost a year and\nIt just hasn't worked out of the individual level in Japan for people with that high octane a drive to a stay at the office till midnight or whatever [noise]\nAh so maybe they're lacking creative conscious something my second question will be about Amazon ah\nI Know they get criticized for putting out small for prior does and I can understand that but at the same time the stuff you can find on there that you can find locally even even in New York for example I got\nI got this great gloves shoveling my neighbors snow and that's the main thing I Need it but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota [noise]\nI'd go for the first question again [laughter] and so I just ... boiling on Long Island and I'm from Long Island too but what was the first question\nGo ahead and give us an office again Joe\nJoe\nYou know now that there's for example and explosion and video ... you know like half has everything people get on a smartphone I think of as video based\nJust how should people if they're trying to move ahead in the world just pick and choose how they consume information or to emphasize a because it doesn't necessarily work out to put the ... the effort into something whether it's just so so much information you know like\nLike a carnival of sand on on the ... what good does it do that ... it's just too overwhelming\nThought were they weren't lemons Romanians you're quite\nA lot of information that we get as it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if I'm a ... a lot of the the the Gen white kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you can ask them simple questions about you know what's going on in the world and they can't answer is\nBut so so how do you sift through this which you have to do is you have to compare several sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I really don't come to any kind of conclusions unless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with information\nAnd in terms of Amazon I think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we open the Internet we opened up the world we we just that was our view to the innards of the world\nAnd I think what's what's going down with Amazon is just something that's naturally transpiring and I think it's just going to get nothing but bigger you're going to see commerce is going to change everything about commerce is going to change\nThat we've done a company that ships radios they make radios and their make darn good radio see Korean company and I I used to get my radios from them long before I started doing this show\nAnd it was simple you you go on line you order what you want it's delivered to your house in some cases it's free shipping based on the deal that they've got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money on gasoline you don't have to find a crowd it's ... it's it's amazing\nThat's amazing I mean\nIt's infinitely easier you know when when you look at the boomers ... how do you do business with a boomer you save them some time you make their life easy and you don't rip them off this was perfect and so Amazon is is is going to do nothing but a grow\nA you know and that online retail is going to see you know the temperature\nI think so too they hurt bricks and mortar but I mean the the the goods are still being manufactured um the Amazon employees zillion people\nUm some of which complain about their job there um for conditions and things like that but I mean there are there any hired people so there's displacement she so when the bricks and mortar stores go really the only big thing to get hurt and you know some people are out of work but they can find jobs elsewhere\nIt's the real estate that just sits there what's gonna happen with that stuff\n[noise] that's a good question you know I Know that a a commercial real estate is you know ... you know suffering some issues right now some serious issue\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall right about now\nNo no no but but but I certainly would buy residential\nWould I Would buy residential every day of the week yeah it's a seller rent out\nOh yes [laughter]\nYeah no in fact I'm you know I I have a house in them but either Springs Florida and in a in a have a house and in ... Connecticut and I'm In the house and a half of Connecticut's ... thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just rattling around in it and what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it will get we're going to come up with an executive rental forward\nAnd and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't want I have the ... going to be very big\nWhile he's got that company like air being beat up the rent out house houses and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and the ... solicit through air being beat exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that are\nReally they're very happy very cool yeah and I I Would I subscribe to that\nWhat you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes [noise]\nOne of the things that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and that that's going to remain\nIn place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that essentially demanded\nA you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had is a very young right now and just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them ...\n... oh yeah K. juicy direct dot com K.

different position\nThey are they are really in an entirely different position and and they have their own problem there about one point four billion people in fact we're not really even sure how many people are in India but we we ah my best guess is that there's more people in India that there are in China\nBut they have about a two and a half trillion dollar GDP and then went ... and ... may sound like a lot but when you compare that to the United states with twenty\nTrillion GDP there's really no comparison so it it's it's not India is not an up and comer the biggest problem that India has is wealth distribution they literally have have\nHave dots there and there's no\nOne in between and uh they they don't seem to\nNot search and creating civil unrest and everything else\nYeah you would think that but they kind of a pastor people but I you know I I don't know you you would you would think that there would be kind of an unrest ah because they're poor people are really poor and the rich people really rich that's dumped between\nLet's go to Josh in Toronto, Canada hey Josh thanks for calling go ahead\nGood evening gentlemen how you doing great thank you good I'm a longtime listener love your show George here it every night even from our belt the\nThank you Josh thanks for hanging in there with us along\nAnyway I just wanted to touch base on that Amazon thing I don't know if you or your ... can I don't know if you heard about a Amazon is opening now Amazon Go stores and they're planning to open up a many many more three thousand in total by the end up uh twenty Twenty one have you guys heard about that I Can't I have not\nThe water goes stores are Josh\nAnd so basically you go in and you pick up a I get the most popular items and you just\nBuy it right there retail wise instead of on line so it's a retail store Amazon Go you're walking you pick out I got the items that they have there and the most popular items I guess that that month or that week or whatever and you just pick it up and go get a phone chargers things of that nature uh extra\nInteresting and then I bet they would use their website to let you know what products are going to happen in the store at any given time\nI'm sure that that's a great thing for people or of the older generation who don't really feel comfortable with uh computers they can just walk in it got what they want and go as Amazon Go\nInteresting take on Sundays and earlier Amazon ghosts and the sounds on go I've got go some of my mind with Halloween coming up and they want\nHim to think that the concern that I Would have about that is the same concern that I had with Amazon taking over a whole foods and that is a when you have a brick and mortar store retail is detail some very very different\nA kind of business at Amazon has succeeded in so I don't know let's let's see what they do with this that could really intriguing yeah could be\nI Try and get them whenever sometimes ... ... people that are successful get caught up in your own success and think they can do everything everything that's right yeah and so the the whole whole foods thing is sort of successful but I don't know I really don't know if they're going to make it with that\nLet's go to ... New Orleans sign all and go ahead sir\nHey George I'm a longtime listener too and you and the best ... teams to truck driver master furry thank you I'm your age I'm\nThe one I'm a Gemini in Nineteen fifty I think\nYour shape thing you can for for me huh June for for me to learn about you you may thirty four so I can pull apart your older than me anyway your your grandma\nAnd the great man and you're very family and you know I was going to exercise your guest about um you know the abortion issue we're losing a lever because of abortions but it's a tough it all on her in a kind of a liberal and it was kind of a hurtful well they talked about nationalism being with white Christians\nAnd then at the bottom of the Iowa I heard about the global elite planning and then when I thought about that and I remember going back to most of the abortions back then\nWe'll we'll white people when you have is Seventy eight eighty million people now I don't know what the abortion number is 'cause I just knew that I had a lot of friends with my customers driving the truck or you hear about\nA with lady's gonna adopt baby so their kids wanted to have an abortion blah blah blah and and it was just a big problem back in the late eighties\nI'm just wondering um you know the the control with the elite with the abortion and uh and how much we lost the um the work you know the because of abortion\nTouring the little the chicken or how many ... I I don't know what the county has but what do you think that readers can\nAbout a million a year for a million ... million\nAbout a million a year and and that it's it's a disproportionate a at a at ethnically so\nUh we we have aborted about forty million people uh you know in in the last forty years we just have a ... foot [noise] um it it's a it's a terrible thing I don't think we would have forty million more people if if abortion was illegal\nOr simply because I think people use abortion his birth control I I don't think they use it as a you mean it's it's it's almost like a [noise] you know a a pill\nAnd most\nPeople the people that are going to have four kids are going to have four kids and and if it if you know you have an unwanted pregnancy at a particular time then uh they seem to have their abortion\nBut Marion Portland hey Mary taken away\nHow high caring for a very nice guy can you tell that'll ... can thing of campaign and then you never know how can that way than going\nWell there are three under served um categories in relative to health care right now one of them is healthcare the others elder care in the last one is death care death care is totally unnecessary if we don't have enough funeral homes we don't have enough cemeteries we don't have enough ... to handle what's gonna happen when the boomers start to die\nElder care is totally underserved\nHealth care people need healthcare there's there's a trigger here and it's it's Seventy five and the baby boomers right now are fifty four to Seventy three so two years from now\nYou're going to see a spike in health care or the need for healthcare services like we've never seen before in the history of our nation\nCan I remember when you were on with me a year ago we talked about like marketing Harley Davidson don't they missed the boat too didn't they\nYeah Harley Davidson right now the the ... if you if your listeners have a Harley don't try to sell it because you're not going to get anything for a it\nIs because the baby boomers have literally moved on the baby boomers are are fifty four to Seventy three years old and a lot of them can't hold hardly up at a light anymore\nEither heavy bikes out the generation right behind him is too small to sustain it it it it just is the people that were born Ninety five nights in eighty four is a small a indigenous generation of about this uh sixty nine million peas the markets motorcycles going down yeah it is that's interesting overall overall is\nGoing down to the Japanese brands got stung so bad back in the eighties and nineties where their business fell eighty percent the Japanese brands that they that they just never reconsidered the market\nEvery once in a while I'll watch uh on YouTube you know what's my line TV show you a little black and white and they will always\nYou know see what's my line what so and so and so and so and then brought to you by and in those days they didn't have sophisticated produced commercials they would do some of them live on the set up for that TV show or they'll just take a picture of the product or something like that\nAnd I'm looking at talking about trends now things have changed I mean in in those days that type of presentation wouldn't work today\nNo it wouldn't it simply wouldn't it our our uh", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Coosada", "day": "30"}
