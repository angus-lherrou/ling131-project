Roosevelt White House of some of the economy and that had he's here\nOh well the first communist overhead as there was a Monday house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth they came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh there there were there were hundreds of at least Fifteen high ranking officials and left the White House where knowing communist starting with Harry Dexter why all the way through the elder his\nAnd they were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins which turned out later he was fingered in Nineteen Ninety and I'll talk about ... into the er at length later so they don't get bored on their way is more common [laughter]\nUm the or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office the department of state the national labor relations board the labor advisory board\nOf the war productions board the price of administration the U.S Treasury Department U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee\nSo I won't bore you on with the laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were\nYou know who were in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of of people so I mean he was just communist we're all around them Harry Hopkins actually was the HHS secretary of state\nHe was one of the architects of the new deal\nIt was one of FDR's closest friends and confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know obviously\nEvery FDR couldn't travel very well because of his affliction and you know the races in the wheelchair and so forth so we had to have someone fly over to talk of Stalin and so forth and\nUh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was ... ah friends of Eleanor Roosevelt 'em through the CPU essay the Communist Party United States of America which is still in existence by the way up north I mentioned that or not\nAnd how they Hopkins in style and get on\nFamously he was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by he was also architect below my lease program to help the Soviets out\nSo Harry Hopkins ... famously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming the waters in America before all of this happen okay I'll get to the minute\nHe was Harry happens afterwards fire afterwards was fingered by a KGB the factor and I'm going to butcher this name I'm old they grew up ... and there's a name here I just simply couldn't begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB the factors they both identified\nHarry Hopkins is the mysterious agent Nineteen who is contacting a Soviet Union about uh the the than on a project\nWhich of course we all know is a nuclear weaponry\nSo here we have I mean there are informants and spies all around\nThe FDR so so the point where they he goes to the Toronto conference you\nKnow I mean that'd be a style and knows more about Roosevelt than Roosevelt knows about\nOf all how how penetrated the Americans were uh at the hands of the Nazis weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him\nStalin white information right he had plans in the post war world of taking America was half communist anyway he had plans of taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler so he was a little diluted in his own in his own right\nBut how this all happened was\nPrior to this of course this was a new ideology\nCommunism wow this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this and that and you know we don't have to go to work in every word is provided for\nWell Stalin had sent invitations to um\nTo the directors of Hollywood a union leaders a college professors he knew who the target\nAnd they would were sent invitations all expense paid to go over to Russia to see how this this work and they went to a city and the city's names is a thing as it is are listed in my book and they they were to observe how\nRussia did things and how everyone was care for how this work and how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this fear country because you're you know look ... look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities town was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how they tried to recruit anyway and loudly\nSo it was a fictitious town that didn't exist there was made a cardboard basically so\nThey can village a Potemkin village\nAnd there you go um he sends all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meaning our country\nAnd to this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil umpires you know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here said never been done before\nSo this was an experiment amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings string point by stone stone is the puppet master\nHe uh he's this guy what he managed to accomplish\nIn his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the votes of the revolution and he ended up\nThey just didn't make fun of style and\nHe was nothing more than a he was to keep the party's earn a loser and use the column\nTom read 'em when they come Konrad index card was Tacoma gray blur used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless and the party\nOne by one knocked off everyone in the party that take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote that in his or the quote from lens will come redstone is to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd for someone to death they they called him a you know a pen pusher and all kinds of stupid things\n...

humans was the ones that are gray Persian the famine in Russia under Stalin and must Rick\nOr anybody you know [laughter]\nYeah well it never ceases to amaze um I just wanted to chicken is because people need to know it's where you know you're on the east coast it's three forty in the morning and a three hours is a long stretch to talk so I just want to make sure you're you're doing OK and we appreciate you being here with us and staying up late\nSo I'm I wanted to talk about it was so much of the post world are so much of the post war world is a result and then in the ensuing Cold War and and all of that really is a result\nCondition he greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference in your pain forty four when when that post war world was really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon\nRoosevelt spray all condition or and and um after you I really didn't know what happened dean he just was so out of it but you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the L to conference\nAnd obviously he is he he looks like death warmed over like seven months before at the Tehran Conference he looks is as fit as a federal I mean what is going on with what happened in those seven months\nWell up until this point we've been talking about the barn but we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with them I'm happier as being slowly poisoning from within the White House and I have to be very careful here not to give this book away\nBut it was a type of poison and let's see we're used to thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and what they were poisoning with with something that was\nPlentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet but\nThe rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they hit a jump on us\nAnd you know I don't think grandpa Walton would've known anything about\nPoisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially because they didn't know it was poisonous at the time so FDR as\nBeing slowly poisoning from inside the White House every time he goes away too Warm Springs Georgia\nTo sow his ailing legs and go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically rejuvenate himself he starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or so I I did a little\nDigging into this because it was just so what started me on this whole thing of FDR I thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient\nThat in the tiny Marshall Eighteen days a Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently at the end of the war I thought that was a little convenient\nSo this is what people and say we just started looking into this for and this and that I also thought it was convenient that FDR just\nDied of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was a little to get all that convenient so and when I started to dig in and I saw that the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period\nI said you know wait a minute I've really got to look into this I didn't believe it in high school when we were taught about it back then they actually taught history you know I mean [laughter]\nIt but in the book you point out how his his doctors I guess Dr mcentire admiral a navy admiral mcentire his personal physician\nAnd his his cardiologist Dr Howard grew in they were they had no idea what was going on when he and they were doing X rays and take doing all of these tests they were really clueless\nWell and this is where you know this is where the rubber finally started to meet the road for me they really work for what they were thinking the American public just thought oh he ... himself out for us and you know he was the advance of polio and this and that and the other thing and\nThe symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors emmer Ross McIntyre who's the White House physician he was also the vice admiral and in a certain sort of in general in the navy\nUm you know he was FDR's physician from thirty to forty five until he died\nWorse FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors\nOr he was chief of cardiology it but as though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy no idea [laughter] so what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled as because FDR is getting sick after meal times\nThis is my first hand something was wrong and his blood pressure would bounce\nHe would do normal and then it would do it would go roaring out of control three ten over one Ninety five or something and it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard to every any it wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving him\nSo when when they when they\nGot to this point they should look at you know Nineteen forty four is rolling around this guy's going to run for president again\nAgain and we've got to get to the bottom what the hell's going on here so they send them to the doctor of the day Dr frankly founder of the lead clinic in Boston and he's a surgeon and he is the guy\nIn America at the time [laughter] so he examines FDR in March in Nineteen forty four\nAnd um when he comes out was is a ... a glaring statement which is now available online you can look it up at the History Channel\nBasically saying that this is a dead man walking and the way he the laundry list of symptoms that he reveals that FDR has does not align with the advance of polio\nThey advance they align with the advance of poisoning FDR as being slowly poison styling Stalin got him I can tell you that I'm\nStyling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar conference 'cause he wants to rule the world\nAfter yard he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world um the United states Great Britain sign in the Soviet Union so they could all police there are a quarter of the world FDR didn't want to share of the world where the I'm Sorry Stalin didn't want to share the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world\nHe was a megalomaniac look at what he did in the Soviet Union of course we didn't know that that wasn't wasn't you know reveal to us until years later\nWho died that was part of the negotiations team in the U.S at ...\nAm on the way back from the all time or one of Roosevelt aids died conveniently also on the brain and your as\nWell there are people dropping dead around FDR ran in ... all over the place that no one writes about again no one writes about this or his name was power Watson and he was a high ranking naval officer he was on the way like I Believe from the surround conference\nDies on this ship cerebral hemorrhage gets back he being FDR he gets back\nA short time later I'm FDR's personal secretary\nAlso named McIntyre into relation to the doctor Ross McIntyre he dies of his cerebral hemorrhage\nThe drug of the day is worth ... rat poison\nIts colorless tasteless odorless and its circulating all over the place as a matter of fact Stalin got murdered with rat poison or for him from and from the internal is governor that came out later as well\nSo there's a lot going on war friend is not what got FDR would have been to sudden it would have thrown up too many red flags okay\nStyle wouldn't want it to deal with Harry Truman he wanted to deal with Harry Truman 'cause he wasn't as political savvy or so he thought he knew that FDR was\nHe couldn't outsmart them okay so here's you know this had to happen um for someone to get his way and we he had been so infiltrated the government with everywhere\nYeah I never seen averaging check it out ... dot com do see a menu and all the information you need so

definitely not the first one to come up with us I'm In ... commissioned a private investigator to or they get to the bottom of the stuff so I Do know that um\nThe private investigator and then all of FDR's medical records were were stolen from all walks filing with us though so one of four people had those keys or one of them was a doctor and a ... it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote to\nThe uh the book being um the White House physician and that was a run in a mirage mcentire were they in on the murder I have absolutely no idea I I couldn't say I have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit little ignorance maybe and\nAnd what happened to ... the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she tops husband [noise]\nWell they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or two afterwards well immediately afterwards\nWell they packed up the uh I'm a Robin and assume it's off and the thrillers Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with among others um [laughter]\nAnd um they tried to get a Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so in her book um her being um with off in her book she describes the place that they took who to get away from Warm Springs Georgia which I thought was a little crazy because if it was a natural death\nUm why I don't know why would you lie to flee the scene right right you know I mean if it's a natural death why still the records you know and then there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually\nUm JFK shot and Dallas they break law to bring him to a out of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas they break law to bring him to besides the now\nThe law was the same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it to the ... with us so both you know both ah JFK and FDR's body I removed illegally they're both\nYou know what this could talk you know and then they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's stuff to him being buried they couldn't get this guy's body in the ground fast enough no nor do by the way and no one moment\nNo autopsy knowing bombing\nIt's just easier and crazier and crazier all the way through so I mean and there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at them you know not just this I'm going to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but\nThere are other presidents in history who I also believe had been murdered that they've lost over um Warren Harding\nWarren Harding was it was that was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one that we thought about as far as FDR's concern I mean the the [laughter]\nThe information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still boggles my mind and you know the book has been published for a little while now and I still even after the book is one published you know I'll find a new fact and go wow I should have put in the book I mean there's\nThere'll be a volume three perhaps uh let me get to the cold here and he's in Alabama and the wild card line any good morning welcome to coast\nThank you Steve I'm calling to ask you about some written Musa ... she was several of Eleanor Roosevelt garden party she's to my aunt who work at the state department and Benjamin now\nAnd also like ... cents can experience with the blood thinner prescribe for my grandmother which was ... it costs to ten things all over the root\nCauses bleeding all in the body this month and it can cause and you're in\nThere you go but you don't you say it wasn't a warfare and with Roosevelt because that would have been too quick\nYeah it was it wasn't people around him they were disposing of World War for him because and she's right she's right I mean it's been the blood out to to the point where if you touch a person they'll get\nYou know either their their brains will either bleed or the ... or something or cerebral hemorrhage and also of course I Know Dr but my parents were both they're both on a variety of blood fed her so\nBy my late father was as well\nNot necessarily caused bruising with any thanks for calling on\nThank you uh let's go back in the wild card line is it my New York\nMy hide their good morning okay as quick a three part of and\nI listen all over the and finally I look for I heard it dental man on the air I heard wet said top plea or also believe that the waste waste a lot of it and I'd like to know if he would have been nice in theory around in\nA second and what is it the grasses so he would be someone that would talk about that new the new deal as\nAs um uh doing the right thing around that that they are for the call Great Depression\nAnd so I like his thoughts on that and lastly he named him about both a direction connection and they are both FDR and it's a towering stable genius if you will and the White House\nInsane somewhat different because with the ... and then they shake it and they seem to have more to do with leading up it will even now he wound up as president and of course the money that he had to go to encounter in Saudi Arabia\nAnd he I don't have a fair and you say you know we know that he ... about ... and in\nMy I had if I could just jump in here because we're not talking about Trump I think if it's not to put words about but I think you were being kind of facetious\nOr about the Russian connection with Trump but let's just stick to to FDR where we could do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dusty and so forth but and you're right ... a big fan of FDR and no Webster a little bit and and I've had dinner with them and and he waxes on about the new deal\nUh obviously Steve you're you're not a fan did you have anything to add\nUh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time I think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go 'cause I don't it from my knowledge there's never been done before\nSo I mean I have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing it helped a lot of people\nUm it just wasn't along sustaining campaign so uh as far as the Russians in the current administration yeah I was kind of even a little suspicious as to how how everyone is in our history it kind of repeats itself what kind of doesn't you know um it's it's amazing how we have the [laughter]\nWe were right back in the same thing we have another red scare and in the country it's really it's really something else if ... if you were alive you know it would it would really enjoy those rightly\nRight so I think the point they are making there was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today it's I guess you would to coin a phrase from CNN it's nothing burger\nRight I mean if I mean if they ever proven with Trump which I don't know if they're ever going to um they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting how\nHow how to reach another red scare it's starting to repeat it solve all over again and here we are Seventy some odd years passed its funny which is how history repeats itself becomes relevant actually I'm an interesting book I think you'll like it thanks\nVery much and I ever growing up\nWe will uh we're heading into a break here at the er the bottom of the hour and then we will get to a more calls people are lined up in Chicago Pennsylvania Gulfport, Mississippi San Pedro California Sioux Falls South Dakota we'll get to as many of you as we can\nAnd here's the Reverend Al Green I'm so tired of being alone taking a break on coast to coast am\nMom my\nBack in ... I don't I've read up on this or I was fascinated with tall and how he got away with all that stuff when Roosevelt God dollar that somebody to look at Roosevelt body apparently and make sure that uh let's see if he would he would call her the colon did a lot of that\nAnd I think he would prefer the story was that he was tired of ... he won that runs ... could break them over the cold that the Iran and uh you know and all that and got the deal he was afraid of ... ... ... again by the fact that the caller wanted in debt I I think he did not want them to want to deliver the pop like\nCars parked my take on it All right interesting Jon Cote in bad shape you're going to die anyway All right Steven you want to reply [noise] um\nI you know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been told 'em have shown slanted okay I'm not suggesting that what you said has been he looks Sylvana Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poison\nSystematically poison\nThat's why he look so bad in Nineteen forty four this wasn't from the advance of polio and it spills out very very plainly in my book so it's a it's an interesting time in history it was an awful lot of people who researched this and I learned from every one of them I'm not gonna sit here and professor know every little angle that's for sure\nBut um as far as style and Stalin wanted to rule the world he didn't he didn't have any interest in hearing anything with FDR\nSo if he sent something to look in the ... in the end of the ... what was going on he was already being there that that was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he died\nSo if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting that didn't if indeed that had happened\nIt was probably just so he could uh you know give recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of falls propaganda\nI John thank you for that some interesting points there ah let's see how to James in Philadelphia\nHi James good morning welcome to coast to coast\nYou Richard uh but my guess for my question for Mr Thing it's just there's so many and in your research physical or did you come across a anything about ... to ... an attempted coup against so Roosevelt and the thirties and that\nUh if it did happen if you came across it how close was it a to happening and if it costs us ... uh it was a exposed by an army generals mainly butler and one of the people involved was a I think was a car through it\nDid he come the happening um if it if it did happen if there was an attempted coup against Roosevelt\nSaid something that you discuss in the book but or is it sees\nA James thanks for calling and I did run run into that information but it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there\nI thought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did um and ... yeah I don't really I don't know like I said people say a lot of things I don't know how true that really is\nWith the amount of people who are around Roosevelt who\nDidn't like him for multiple reasons\nI'm from you know suppressing the uh the the capital is to holding office as long as he did it would not would not surprise me\nBut I mean as far as as far as that's concerned I don't have any I don't have any great knowledge into that I discovered it after the book but I did run into it so thanks for calling I'm Sorry I couldn't be of much help there like I said I I I I Would be lying if I said I felt that I knew everything\nI mean James thank you for that Wayne as in Chicago Wayne good morning welcome to coast\nBanking ridge or one time you can do their job to return from nine to ...\nWell that's very kind of you to say but it's you know it's great gas like Steve who who make my job very easy\nRight where are our American literature um you're the Mars commercial back in the day to Mars period and commercial where we're ... or ... ... ... ... who am I going to record for certain or trigger a bar in her ...\nYear I was almost getting hungry Wayne and tell you had to bring up Churchill [laughter] I Know our number\n... ... where in order um\nWe are ... you're on your go on ... ... reward them talking about this gear was talking about and make it a very compelling very Kerry is like ... ... everybody are committed suicide or nurse weren't Eleanor\nHurry up and bury him so nobody knew about it I I've been looking for the man on the on line on ... for the summer of ... knock your arm but\nHe gave a very compelling period it will be there is ... ... men on in this gear on right now compared to know where do you think we're\nShort I've I've not I've not heard that before but I'd have to I'd have to look into that um [noise]\nI guess the question would be why why would he um why would he do that I don't know Stephen have you have you ever come across anything indicating any theory that ... that FDR may have tried to take his own life or did they don't like\nYou know that's a new one on me uh I haven't heard that but again like I said I'm I'm\nYou know I I Know what I Know I don't know what somebody else knows [laughter] I just I just I wrote this book and I ... I followed the line of facts that brought me to it and I found information along the lines to cooperate it\nYou know if somebody else has come up with that I don't I don't media's quality of life couldn't have been great you know with the with the situation in the head with this polio I mean anything's possible people said that all of us probably committed suicide to um I certainly have certainly uncovered and who murdered oversight certainly uncovered information that the bones bad but\nI guess anything's possible I mean if there is a situation where I can get on the air with the other fellow I Would respectfully love to do so\nI'd leapt I'll look into that a lane thank you for that can you hear Neal while while does in Pennsylvania we're moving fast you're well good morning welcome to coast to coast\nBy Richard nice should talk to your watch again like why\nAnd one and two in the midst of all these motors yours character or anything but uh we have to remember that in Nineteen forty five when FDR passed away the life expectancy for men I Believe was only like forty nine that sixty so\nAt sixty three FDR was already beating the odds so to speak now\nAnd it shouldn't have medical science she was pregnant and then we can go back briefly the elements when Elvis died in Nineteen Seventy seven or the medical science compared to that that was permitted\nNow as I recall Mr obeying the I Believe I called the last time Mr oh Benny when John and he said that Elvis had no history of heart disease now\nUh with all due respect Richard his mother was born in Nineteen Seventy ... died in Nineteen fifty eight which would make her at the most forty two when she died and his father died relatively young I Believe about sixty seven So Richard we have to ask ourselves whether\nOr not it was in the genetic cards for outlets level I'm Alive\nHe can tell you that he's and then he talked to the person who held Elvis's heart in his hands and said that there was no last time there was no evidence of a heart disease at least none that I Would be to kill him I mean it may have developed later but it wasn't present at the time of his death\nRight Hi well thanks again for your call I'm Gladys died because colonel Parker she was ... okay\nColonel Parker toll Gladys that you're obese and I can't fill me with Elvis and I wanted to take pictures with you with Elvis because people want to see Elvis his mother because there was a rumor out but Elvis had shot his mother which was ridiculous\nSo he said I Want you to take his diet pills I Want to get your skinny so they can put you in pictures with Elvis\nI'm the diet pills and the alcoholism combined is what killed her okay that's what happened with that as far as Elvis was concerned in his heart\nUm there was no evidence of a heart attack I'm In ah I talked to Dan ... who was actually on the autopsy and they took Elvis Presley is hard\nAnd they caught it they thinly sliced it every quarter inch to look through everything and they held every quarter inch per up to the light and they looked at it under the electron microscope\nThere was no real evidence of a heart attack there was no ... there was no hemorrhaging there was no nothing Elvis Presley is heart was a little oversized but so we're both or all of his other organs\nHe was years away from heart disease and he can clearly be said that um there was there was no uh Elvis Presley did not die from any sort of a a cardiac event now the coroner who said that he died from a a cardiac arrhythmia\nTelling more stories and mother goose here we have the autopsies not even finish these have certainly been in yet he's telling the world that Elvis Presley died of a cardiac arrhythmia in order for him to determine that he would have had to listen to the beating heart cardiac arrhythmia can't be determined when Howard has stopped", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Coosada", "day": "21"}
