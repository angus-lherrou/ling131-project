are no human rights at all like you know watching federation like China ah and certainly you know the Gulf states are led by Saudi Arabia were beheadings and had shopping\nAnd chopping off hands and fingers and you name it goes on on a daily basis so the ... situation George\nWhich is now the city and officially in about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still there's a lot of loans didn't the don't get counted\nLet me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or mental walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have women laws right if the school\nWe can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [laughter]\nUp but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of uh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan ... for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the thing was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most apps and of the consumer protections that I just mentioned\nWhat if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nAnd they get that discounted off their student loans so you know that's ...\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation\nOr something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless you're making a minimal ah annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise] um [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there\nBut I can tell you that what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen\nA you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nUh people like Thomas Jefferson George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants or so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniformed bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war\nHas the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise] ah so the founders you know are they required bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student\nLoan that's all they were going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition Allen\n[noise] for a while you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to default on the loan\nDefault don't that's\nRight if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead\nWell that's a defining hallmark of a predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies in the service or as the guarantor ours are often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than alone the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where you know credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default [laughter]\nAh but it turns out that uh the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated this alone\nThe agents that I'm compelled the bar or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they got a sixteen ... percent commission right off the wall so you know where they can make the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for servicing a healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four five six years on a defaulted loan that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that ... there's a federal student loans system are just completely perverted and it's been in turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nSnowy spleen to process all the default alone in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let's let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of and by any means so\nA student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nHere does it does a good case um could easy numbers to start with so a fifty thousand or student loan when the student graduates let's say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years [noise]\nAh they're unable to make payments they\nLose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise] um the student can expect a lot to be thrown into default\nSo the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably defaulted somewhere around ... let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars well with penalties and fees and capitalize interests that are slapped onto that loan\nVery quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty twenty\nFive is hitting the ball or is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment in full for\nRoughly ... let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars oh my God so what the ... what the lending system will do will say oh you're into falls on your loan\nBig trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment we can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nIt'll be taxed too you stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the borrower\nSo ultimately they will wind up um hopefully in the government hopes of going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments\nFor about a four ten months typically none of those payments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that oh this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for much a newer much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well these agents and get his sixteen percent commission on the value of that new alone so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that they compel them to do this loan rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus he says it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nPeace in the ... these agents are collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... and higher education\nOr others as well on these these companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own guarantor so they also have a lot of the legacy student loans from back in the day before President Obama\nThese companies make out like bandits they would rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than uh than alone the remains and get good said and I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there\nTo rehabilitate you're alone it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these devolved as long as that rehabilitate they default again three to four times and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan defaults again\nAnd that happens something like eighty percent of the time\nAnd the whole process starts\nAgain to stay with us Allen let's talk about if there's any recourse here and again we'll take calls next hour with Alan calling U.S Coast to coast down sign up for coastal zone or free email newsletter today at ... dot com\n[noise]\n\nThomas Jefferson once said there are two ways\nThe other is by debt and you have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loans are they going to lose in court and there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is\nThey will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get to some and then they become subject to arrest\nSo in the state of Texas for example uh inter around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to uh to come into court that way to deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server or the sheriff or private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nRuled that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly are and just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was like three thousand dollar loan [noise] and they hauled this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know at ... penalties interests and court costs and these are the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nThat's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison [noise] uh that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy rates ahead of the power to declare war has risen army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThey all fifty thousand or they want to pay them since the let's assume that's what they want to do but you're saying because of these defaults the fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that it grows even more\nCan't they just cut a deal on the fifty\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a default alone if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it ...\nWhat kind of settlement is that\nFor most people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place\nUh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan default is pretty unrealistic for most people [noise] uh so that you know the government has got you where do they want you on the student loans\nThey're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org so many years ago\nYou know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nOr you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um [noise] I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was a sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who's this\nOur constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you seeing that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there was about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoke suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired ah from this public employment on in the for the case of default to student loans as cannon is happening as we speak\nHas this cross a park party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what is President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAre unfortunately the past say three presidents really has only made the problem worse under Obama I'm Obama essentially federal lies the lending programs so that where before\nA bank such as well as I mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae Nell et cetera where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans and by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year\nWhich is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program\nNow Donald Trump saw this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before he said why is the government property on student loans if this is nonsense you know of all places that the government shouldn't be making a profit\nYou would think student loans would be it a and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five\nYou know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans the lending system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days I'm so unfortunately you know those ... don't Trump's rhetoric was really good\nBut since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy device\nWho herself had stock in struggle and collection companies [noise] ah and you know frankly I don't think President Trump has really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds [noise]\nUh so I have I hold out some hope for him [noise] ah but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could file bankruptcy and wipe out your students that what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um\nSome of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away\nAnd so um so yeah Congress is ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable [noise] what we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening\nFar less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans and bankrupt\nTheir loans so there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that we've had just suffered under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing because this was a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against us citizens\nWere with Alan calling his website a student loan justice dot org linked up the coast to coast am dot com his book is called the student loans scam you're on some kind of a nationwide tour these days tell me what you're doing\n[noise] oh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called HR twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply um delete the one line of federal code\nThat makes student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings so this really gets to the core of the problem and ah by by getting this bill passed\nA we would immediately see a dramatic decrease in the price of college\nAh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does administering the program [noise] ah so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nTelling a lot of people would prefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma or is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively to fix some of these student loan issues\nWell absolutely and I agree nobody wants to file for bankruptcy is a terrible thing to have to do and and even more difficult thing to fight for I should say [noise] ah but it's just the threat of bankruptcy that would really help the lending system but you know there there are a lot of things that we can and should be doing you know as I mentioned earlier President Johnson\nGift certificates are always available William Mason

I'm a conservative everyone knows\nThat I'm the guy that almost won I lost a forty three\nSplit decision in the shadow case I'm kind of life pro gun I'm a sport right conservative as Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals want a free hand out okay but the college tuition is technically and legally attacked because it's money go into an arm of the state government college and were being over tax\nThat's also the role as a matter of fact the price of college is about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and here's the thing okay we spend a lot of money on our military and it it's too much really we spend a lot in you know even as a conservative we spend a lot of money on Social Security\nBut we can only ... those things a little bit\nThe on the third or fourth thing is probably the tax dollars are being used to make are guaranteed college loans and we don't need to spend any money of that not only does it put the tax dollar on the hook and it's going to crash the dollar like Greece or Venezuela Georgian\nAnd I'm Alan by the way I'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of the Florida group and I hope I'm\nHe'd gotten on an equal talking a little too much and you know [laughter] but this and I I Know the reason is here's the deal OK almost ten percent of the tongue that his college dead and and it's going to crash the dollar that the only thing if we get rid of that you want to let him get a credit card\nIdaho okay with the loans but let them get a credit card it'll things the tax dollar and it'll save the student is college will drop like a rock\nAnd the I I Love I Love my rich man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals and please looking here if we can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get a look and he can get bankruptcy repeatedly pre millions in bailout and handouts\nAnd if all these rich bank than these colleges can get the rates on student looking here ... that that that those are the two beneficiary in here and\nThen okay and then using third or I we got your point there ... Alan\nAnd you know I I he said a lot there but I appreciate all those points and he's exactly right you know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq [noise]\nI think we can throw a maybe a trillion her show at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view you know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow I think on balance that would probably be a good thing\nLevels uh and you know it would it would um really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system but ... but ... but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nLow you with all the debt right now Alan would you are just a white pit clean\nWell I Will say that if at a minimum bankruptcy protection is or not restored so that people can go to a judge and according to the wisdom of a judge I'm settled that debt according to their means if that does not happen\nThen we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a nonpartisan guy but I Will say that\nA democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt and you\nKnow I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there are able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon is at a minimum a the bankruptcy writes that the founders demanded aren't returned\nBowl and you do have salaries and teacher salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[noise] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate\nIs that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly over charging students by and large\nThey could probably suffer eighth thirty percent if not forty percent reduction\nIn the student loan income that they're currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person a and you know be able to service all the students that they do today so I think there's a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia um\nSo yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise] um but certainly there's got to be a middle ground [laughter] you know and with bankruptcy back with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other Linder has to contend with [noise]\nAh that would go a long ways towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools to lower their prices improve their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFirst time caller mark in Provo, Utah hey mark go ahead\nWell George who said they can't uh they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school I was on a full scholarship they've been paid for my books but the federal government makes you go to the student loan counseling and so I went\nAnd I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me Will Hunting if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest\nOn it oh boy I Would love to sue her this\nDid you end up doing that oh yeah and then life happens the money disappears yeah you know over fifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student loans and loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars a gallon ever pay it off I Will die owing money\nDo they harass you mark\n[noise] no I'm right now they've got me on some ridiculous thing where uh my payment is zero\nUm I did a double major in a minor ... some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I I Would have never tasted that crack had she not pedaled it to me exactly exactly well what do you think yelling the these loans are\nPushed on the students way ahead of any scholarship or any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay it back I mean the college and some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way\nA few private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's it's just disgusting [laughter]\nYou know I might actually add um the repayment program that the to mark is on a is probably the income based repayment program so bunch of government programs out there that sound like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness ... there's income based repayment but what all everybody out there needs to know\nIs that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where\nYou work for a you know if you work in a college or hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trained for that forgiveness are actually getting it\nSo the rest are being disqualified and they're being left wing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan so\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I'd be our program\nAnd actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so you were twenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nSo the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that has you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a they\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was [laughter] ironically it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit I'm inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're going to come back and take final goals with you in just a moment here on coast to coast am [noise]\n... the new version of that goes to ... am map is now available for

E. R. dot com [noise]\n\nAnd welcome back this is our final segment with Alan calling us as we talk about these student loans scam Ellen are the student loans that are out there now hurting or helping the economy\n[noise] [noise] well I I think it's clear that it's hurting the economy at this point\nUh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars more than Ninety billion dollars a year\nOr so that money that gets taken away from home purchases a you know business formation a auto ... you know other ... big ticket items that improve the economy [noise]\nUh so certainly it's hurting in that respect a and you know it's it's also running in a number of ways are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people a straddle or you know strapped under ... this these sort of debt levels\nTypically the sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um this really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't otherwise do\nI'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy a and certainly those people will pay no taxes and then it's\nAny ways that are maybe not\nA parent or to the naked eye\nIt's going to Paul Fresno, California to get things started here west of the Rockies Paul Go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you take my call thank you very much Georgia now them I'm graduated from college two thousand and just before it closed down [noise]\nI'm I'm One of those fortunate who are at one point three to Allen was talking about that actually got um most cars that were given I got thirty four thousand of the thirty seven thousand but I got you know\nThat I owed forgiven wow how'd you do that and resolutions\nI appreciate that thank you well I I did a little bit of a ... um [noise] there's something called a the hills finding\nAnd what that is is that like a lifting of pretty much like a courses you cook or trade the trades you chose yeah and what it is is um if they are of course who are the reason they're in the situation is because they all by job place\nSo if you were from a certain time period to a time period at the end of the school I'm pretty much that's when they committed a that broad who it actually took me from I Would have to say December to ... to around August of two thousand and fixing to get it all given what I did is I actually wrote Kamala Harris email\nUm she surprisingly bonded um but uh the avenue that I went to get a lot ... added right a cover letter hum I submitted a pretty much a with a cover letter I had to put a plenty on it then I had to pretty much just put it all out there would I'd gone through up at the summit transcript that to a\nA cover letter transcripts and pretty much all the information that I actually had to prove that I went to college\nYeah it was the fraud that that got it reduced I guess right\nUh yeah so that's one of the main things I put there because if\nYou see many of the hill college commercials one thing they promises lifelong job placement of cooking [noise]\nSo what how I false advertising exactly who went to school shut down there goes your fall on the job place there goes your life long dropped but if the right you got that right ah interesting Alan isn't it\nThat you know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up at some other point of show there is some breaking news now where if you went to particularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught lying just like the just like Paul mentioned\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings per year degrees this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where\nIf your school ... you then at least on paper you have available to you and avenue called defense to repayment where you\nAt least theoretically he can get your loans cancelled and I\nI think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen this works successfully for him [laughter] ah but I Will say that even just yesterday and um [noise] one of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of delay and slow walk this ... this program so\nAs it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who are light to buy their colleges are then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be because believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely\nHave to uh you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise]\nUm but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so you you were lied to by\nParticularly for profit college or you may may may possibly\nSo you know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credit fraud indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency for some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy the note and they don't provide it to you they're up a creek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right and similarly for student loans we find a lot of a private loans the underlying note uh well first of all balloon has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned a note actually does not owned the note and they have no business clicking on that loan I'm\n... now there are other there are some avenues of the the lenders can go to they can\nSay that the new was lost and they have other avenues to prove that it is a valid note but that's certainly is something to be aware of and I should also say people who have private student loans so not federal student loans\nThey do have statute of limitations so somebody comes up to you Twenty years hands and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than almost certainly that loan is not\nLittle ... little there you suspect um and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where you took up alone\nWho go to pat and Minneapolis east of the Rockies Hi Pat go ahead\nI worked in Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at at least one of the agenda is is the destruction of the Social Security program because\nThere are families with co signers of grandparents for parents and students none of them are ever going to get any thoughts as security for an hour and a question and I think Justin alright if if I own a house and I can find on one of these student loans\nThat does that lean on my house so that when I die instead of my air is getting at\nIt's collected for a for a student loans\nThat goes to the lone first doesn't it\nWell that's a that's a great question to her first point\nYes Social Security wages are being garnished as we speak for student loans and what is even more disturbing icy legislation out there right now and has been passed yet but I see legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in uh in return for people for going\nTheir Social Security when they when they reach retirement age uh so there are some people at work in Washington DC very busy trying to figure out how to take away Social Security benefits down the road from student loan borrowers\nInteresting and ... what did you have one other thing to say\nFamily has already where we don't take generations the grandparents and parents and the kids they're never going to get any thoughts scary but it just you know that if you have if you want to help but still\nAnd tear ability you write a check to the school or a money order or other travelers jak or whatever and when they can bring as yet you know says well here's my transcript from last semester you want to help me this semester\nAnd when you hand over or whatever you're going to help them with don't forget this part of them a pat on the back and say the whole family is proud of you for being such a great student and such a hard worker\nWell that's part of being a good parent that you've got to do that with a child and", "show_name": "Coast to
