started a great their enterprises that that's what I asked her\nTo a seven started with a great they're very exciting fate of the aren't very beautiful\nWhich one do you prefer that we use a\nGreat grand prize is my daughter has just been on the Web master and Web designer it was very very beautiful on all kinds of new things on their\nSuper what do you run up to lately well then that's what we've had a full time right well\nMuch um and getting into the world of cod calf beginning thing was with a book and other kinds of things that have been wanting to move into and\nWe're really getting going with that you were with me years ago and when you were first on which media our executive producer Lisa ... who thinks the world of you says I'm going to give you a special guest he's the mundane astrologer right and I went blind or what are you giving me somebody who's mundane for\nIt it's it's actually uh I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology it's the strategy of nations of world leaders thing with like a clip says new moons full moons major planetary alignment\nIn other words it's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I I've been doing that just as long [noise] um so the word again now people think of mundane kind of\nJust ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology and personal horoscope type readings\n[noise] no I mean well you're dealing with the same plan a fine line there there's a fine line isn't there will\nAgain kind of it's the maker cause them rather than microcosm so people who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things are they prefer to look at the big picture of national events current events the way the world is and when I was growing up\nIt's just kind of where I was they read the the ... the world book um you know the almanac the world dominance in book affects every year would come out back in the fifties and sixties is still going after a hundred and fifty years actually\nMostly for sports like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports baseball football and so on\nSo I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office with the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there\nAnd I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation in the world probably because of that particular event\nMarked tell us exactly what is ... is\nWell aware as said before as above so below this goes back to ancient Egypt the idea of a ... of being called ... or the the thrice great ... which is the actual\nEgyptian Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly that was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know I'm of the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy\nWho is also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we'd go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so much and\nI also studied all kinds of things we regarding Atlanta um when I first got in the whole field I got into reincarnation meditation metaphysics\nLived at the ... community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retro grade planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective he Leo nothing the planets just keep going the ordinary cycles mercury has an eighty eight day forward moving a\nOrbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away\nAnd the astrology we use is what we were called geo centric\nEvery so often all the planets now this is not the center moon George but all the planets will tend to you\nThe perfect metaphor you're at a train station\nAnd you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours\nIs going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you end up kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of ... in your direction but they're like going the other way and it's confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion\nSo what most people have tuned into all over the decades is\nMercury going in reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth prospective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now into that as an Eighteen if he if someone went to Google Earth for one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde year and then you click on images\nIt's the little George with all kinds of things like stop signs and road signs saying mercury richer you don't go here don't go there because people\nAre actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going reverse\nIf you had five different astrologers would you get five different kinds of readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer one way if people who really have studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades\nVery intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same ... somebody or the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and\nThis thing's over the years because I've been on during the election times and often you know people want to hear a prediction it's going to go however astrology really works best\nIn terms of ... ... as you said and he's studied it I'm not just psychology and UFOs and ... dollars and everything else but he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use is called before whatever is born in a moment of time\nHas the qualities of that moment of time it's because time\nShould not be thought of as like I'll meet you at ten o'clock in the morning at such and such a place\nSo that people think of time as kind of convenient system it's really a power and so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts and at the first moment that they take their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around and the great circle\nAnd they're in different signs of the ... and the ... puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of I'm\nAlmost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but\n... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and climate or energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above and below so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most astrologers\nKinda who've been around the horn a long time will come up with a similar result\nArgue psychic too or just ...\nI'm Glad you asked that question I okay if I say out to the public my my son is in ... which tends to be at least as I understand that sign rather reticent to to be a for instance doing well kind of planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes\nMarketing and advertising and commercials stuff I'm much more focused that's why the Monday in astrology or natural things\nAnd so I'm fundamentally um I ... it's interesting you ask me that because I have been very psychic\nBut I don't broadcasted but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most and I saw\nYou stay with us mark where the break we're going to come back and talk about world events and how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer at his website great barrier enterprises dot com Martin Lorna\nDon't forget to watch our TV show me ... George ... just log onto beyond belief dot com\nYour ear and its depending on their pronunciation but that planet the first of the outer planets um which is so powerful when America was born because when a Seventeen eighty one when the American revolution was one of the same year that Iran is was provided by William Herschel and ironically in bath England [noise]\nUm but at any rate that planet has just gone into tour is okay and tourists as the main kind of money\nIn ... New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two [noise] and so not yet but in the o five years\nAh you're on the fence about seven years and the fine that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional\nSoda things coming out of left field shock some surprises Iran us will cross over the sun the solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with from the other thing that I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers of my field people look at these kind of thing with like a a nation's chart nations are born like people if you can locate the birth of country cities have charts\nStates of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now\nWhat about groups does now cryptic does this this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology it's\nThat over about an eight hundred year cycle okay that's actually seven hundred and Ninety four years\nThe ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest planets they've been actually looked at by\nPeople going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were chard and believe it or not because they didn't have\nA all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were stronger is they just didn't have the scientific kind of\nThings that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water\nTo make a what's happening is in Eighteen forty one every Twenty years Jupiter and Saturn have been in earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know it\nBut what's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn merge together at the beginning of Aquarius and then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn's are going to be an air sides and the point here is the crypto currency is or more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA theory that are more on the line that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we're we're ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes\nYeah I guess you could say that\nA very stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter has created it really beautifully it's cold astro flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit\nSo I've got a couple of things on great parents prizes in our or a earth Aquarius news zone so now or the chorus news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius news segment and grape or enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening with Brett Kavanaugh and and\nDr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this well then you can you predict ... I mean today one of his college a range and says I Can't call them a friend but said that he was a drunk\nOr will you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother died of alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum or the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes to to some people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not\nUm he could withdraw I mean you know it it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday I don't think it I think it's going to be hard to prove anything\nThrough um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big\nThursday when the session began you see that's part of Monday and astrology always look at the heart of a personal or you can do that\nAnd I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an inch natural thing with the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a chart just like for a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart is very descriptive of that whole tumbled last Thursday\nCan I put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen but well\nYeah well the thing is is that there's too much unknown but if I ... for the hazard a guess you know I Would just say there's certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal if he doesn't get confirmed is going to be just as conservative with somebody else is going to be nominated\nIn in his in his place so it's not as if suddenly would be a liberal or very early and they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that a squeaky clean well\nI think that would be because they've been saying that uh uh\nBought bought you my question Mr alert you think you'll get confirmed or not um addict or a logical you speaking\nWell astrological you we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control\nAs it used to hazard a guess on that side of the equation\nReduce still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed do you do okay All right that that that was probably that\nMight be one I I I I'll be wrong on going on\nOut I'll say now is at least you took a stand\nRight because when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um were so many of the predictors and you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably went on she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan Wisconsin\nA Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college in Trump won\nSo amazing work now next stop let's talk about Kim is on on and his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think it's happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this'll this'll be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation\nI think it's a done deal that they are going to have nuclear weapons they win and they're never going to get rid of him\nBut what's gonna happen is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it will be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false whether or not a kind of you do these kinds of things that no other president would have ever done and you try and just sort of like make things nights\nAnd then eventually you know right now they just said the other day a ... the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize by the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you've caught that did you see that\nI sure did it it was like we're wait we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they're dragging their feet and then during the ... you know if it was late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next two years were fine what you know and so I this I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this\nIs personal diplomacy we don't know of Kim Jong un is going to be the leader tomorrow the next day in this\nSo don't know what he's doing is the correct\nExactly so you got the tricky thing we the other thing is\nUh in astrology this is very important Donald Trump's char President Trump is known we've known as exact birth time for decades and it's not a mystery Hillary Clinton's birth time could have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talked about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it\nSo he was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't know whether she was morning or evening we don't know the year of Kim Jong un on\nTheir reports who was born in Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five is definitely a Capricorn son we know that we just don't know the year and I think that the north Koreans\nAnd people in that part of the world they're really into astrology and things and they want to keep it a mystery\nMark tell me something with regards to astrology are we going to have a good year for the rest of this year I mean people are uptight there on happy I'm Talking about general not everybody\nThe risky Adams drag you can find that at the intersection of France\nFrom riverside

George hours when I'm doing now in in minutes or an agent and you'd\nBetter be minutes on this show right could you imagine taking hours\nOr you have a it's interesting\nJust like the previous caller another moon in areas okay we're which means like from the path recent lifetime\nYou've developed leadership skills that you need to bring through their kind of instinctual like being in charge being assertive without being aggressive so there was a kind of forceful part but your son sign Aquarius\nAquariums need to learn through groups through friendships through team kind of activities or global kind of things\nAre where you're ... you ... that are sort of close to your philosophy of life and what's in your heart and you're also born with Pisces rising which adds if it's positive a compassionate empathic kind of energy and also it's like a quality\nInterestingly you like the previous caller have an enormous amount of Capricorn the previous caller had found a Capricorn you have one two three you have five less devising Capricorn more than even where you have an Aquarius a Capricorn\nUm is worth Saturn is moving and so you also if you want to do this you're you're moving into a strong career cycle\nAnd I mentioned earlier you asked me George something really fortuitous are good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own kind of ... as well here's somebody Donna you're born with Jupiter and said you're curious so it's going to be home coming few over the next here a lot of Jupiter and Saturn\nSo do something in the world there was something you know where you're making 'em expressing yourself in society and kind of a mover in shaker ... even in your community or neighborhood or your state you know to do something that you feel a significant in and worthwhile\nAlright Don good luck to you hope everything works out so amazing mark how you're able to pinpoint individuals with astrology\nWell because it's kind of like if if I were a doctor okay and what I'm doing if you just if you said okay this person needs advice about their chest area and you put an x-ray in front of me I just start talking you know the doctors thing whatever it is nice right then you'd say okay uh looked\nSerious enough that you know going to have to put you on antibiotics and then go back and forth a little bit for how long you know and then come back to me it could be a pneumonia it might be bronchitis will will have to take you know\nHave have you do some you know see what happens so it's kind of like a Rorschach test the chart is\nIs so magical but it's like again if this were a beginner and they'd be looking around and saying what do I do you know I see that there's the symbol for Aquarius there's Pisces there's some Capricorn book it would be like novelty to\nThe but when you have done it for forty six years you know is there like on the website I have what's called the cosmic calendar which used to be walking a planet earth and now it's independent and that's where people can\nSee what's in the sky every day and they can they can subscribe you know for a year or two and we even have a new thing where they can try it for one week for less than a dollar or a month or less than ten dollars it's it's kind of part of the new great there\nWell that's fantastic that's you've been doing this\nTo chart themselves right into the see the direction they're going for advice\nMy whole goal has always been George again this part of my Pisces when I when I Do a consultation for somebody I hate to say that I mean I'd love to have them come back hey I'd like to do a deeper thing and you know I can do charts\nOf compatibility with a loved one or a parent and child but my goal is to get them so excited that ... years later they would come back and say you know you did my reading and I started to study and I'm doing it on my own if I can do that that is the greatest thing that I could do\nCouples ever come to you mark to say are we compatible but well\nI Will say this first of all I don't do this anymore\nBut I used to do a lot of marriage ... really ... but the thing is it's and it's very fine tuned I'm there we have a ... we have reports that we sell coal friends and lovers and there's something called ...\nSo I I Would tell people to go to our strategy you poor thing and they couldn't put in their birth data and get that relatively quickly for me to do things is ... you know it's more expensive you have to do to charge you gotta get background information both people but basically astrologers have been doing this for a long time\nAnd it's and it's like you look at Venus and Mars proponents of love and or the sun and moons matching up and all the different planets but it's quite complex but you can do it\nAre you like a human ... card\n[laughter] well I've created to to row decks one with my ex wife Asia uh we did enter trial courts which have sold well over a hundred thousand copies for the last like almost Thirty years so many different languages and she has done an enormous amount of\nPromotion of that and then I did baseball tomorrow and I just ran into the gal Laura films the other day I hadn't seen her a while and that has not sold all that well because the publishes sort of we're doing calendars but they had never done a true projects so I've done through longer than I've done astrology\nI'm going to give you our next the special callers birth said first of all November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight we're going to Bradley in Illinois Bradley do you know where you were born\nThough Illinois in Delano well and now how about a time any idea\nI'm I'm not sure the day time\nOkay do you have a question for mark who just want him to get going here\nUm

study Chinese now I just wanted to make a you know I Am aware of the five different elements and those kinds of things in the you know the toilet ... the the birthdays that kind of [noise] but um what I Need to know is was it Nineteen eighty eight\nNineteen eighty eight in November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight okay hold on one\nSecond okay and while you're doing that we've got a couple of minutes before the break bark and we'll take some more calls when we come back later on tonight by the way we're going to be talking about flying saucers from beyond the earth would Gordon Moore go ahead mark\nOkay so November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight I'm just putting in like close to sunrise this person is a sun science Scorpio but you're not going to believe is the third time in a row we looked like leave another mood in areas that that is really took that's\nNot so unusual that yeah\nI mean there are twelve times three callers all within areas man\nThat's my mess my audience [laughter]\nSo again we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit its own zero point of varies on December thirty one and New Years which is what I said you know it's it's traditionally a planet of war but it can also be a planet of energy a planet of passion\nFor a sports exercise and this person\nConducting Mars and he's the son signed Scorpio and traditionally Scorpio was also ruled by Mars was considered to the ancient Mars is night fine because it ruled the water side to this person has a lot of Mars a lot of intensity\nUm a lot of difference energy that comes through the Scorpio world and currently Jupiter is making a ... a a crossing just finished three times on\nThis individuals' Marjorie so he the fact that he made it through on this is probably part of Jupiter offering a kind of blessing just that he's on here and again I Would say to him he also has Capricorn strong\nTo do some kind of a study in metaphysics philosophy um people have his son find Scorpio need to really get into deep things\nI'm sort of in a hot and heavy weight and stay with it\nTo pick lottery numbers mark\nI'm I I often enter into the different lotteries Powerball so on a five years ago I had four out of the five numbers are horrible didn't show up those this I've come that would have been almost two million dollars mine is

chart\n[laughter] um [noise] I don't know that that would actually do something although my favorite magazine is astronomy ya gotta Wisconsin I don't know if you get it it's beautiful and the credible\nGotten it for a long time and they just had the previous issue where there's a a free program I don't remember exactly where it is I have in order to get [noise]\nWhich I think is really unique way that people can see\n'em they can plot like around America around the world when the moon would a called a planet or star and even an asteroid so it's sort of comes close to what you're asking about and that's actually a software program so\nIn the software world these are amazing things but meteor you know we have the you know the different kind of meteors storms that happen every so often like this one in August you know the Perseids and different ones\nUm there there may be some effect with some people I think more psychic leave the people who are prone to respond to earth changes you know some people tune in to earthquakes and\nAnimals and you you know things like that so I'm anything's possible but it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nAll right let's go back to the final coal series they line up for you or your ... birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon a birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we'd go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona Tucson how are you Albert\nHey good evening George good evening mark Manhattan the upcoming birthday to you my friend oh well thank you ain't other year oh there you know\nThey keep clicking by do you have a question for mark or just want him to do reading for you\nOr he can do or reading my question would have been kind of in a financial limbo for the last year so I was wondering if that was going to change and the other question is about you know love and money even\nMoney go ahead Mr learner\nA ... by the way I did follow the aries three people in a row because there's something called the part a fortune in Arabic the strategy which was developed a thousand years ago they were all mathematically oriented that's where we get algebra and there was what's called parts like the part of the birth part of marriage and so it was something called apart a fortune\nAnd throughout the entire segment there\nThe part of fortune for Los Angeles and out on the west coast was an areas the sign that the moon was showing up and the part of fortunes very connected to the moon\nAnd the moon was also is the moon as in the cancer and is rising in the first house itself\nSo there was a reason that happened will this fellow now has a ... and ... is from from the past from another life or other existence is in the past\nThis person has developed in this could be why the financial thing I'm more of sort of the need for compassion may be working in religion and philosophy behind the scenes and it's not Pisces is not very much of a mover and shake her in the world\nSo as an individual people who have Pisces moon come in and they're more impact and path okay for good or for ill okay and some people with strong Pisces moon can get sort of pulled into they can become vulnerable you know to other people and lose their way but\nThe sun side of this individual is the sign of a partnership Libra\nAnd he also has Neptune mercury and Venus\nThere in that science so as far as relationship is concerned the keynote esoteric Lee for labor is I Choose the way that leads ... between the two great lines of force and my mentor\nI'm dating Roger talked about Libra as the great pyramid\nFollowing the mystery of the things which is really Leo in Virgo the body of a lie on the head of a it'd be a woman and so the whole Egyptian mystery kind of tradition it goes back to the summertime is of cancer Leo Virgo and lever and so so basically spiritually\nThis person should study everything about the great pyramid and that would be very good because there's a lot of more about mysteries even Jesus going and being a potentially initiated you know two thousand years ago during those last years from you know from age twelve or Thirteen to thirty three\nGoing all around the world to India possibly to Egypt going to a glass and very and in England I mean these are kind of lower but may very well have happened so study the great pyramid study Egypt a and get into things like reincarnation metaphysics that might help\nAlright anything else they're Albert no\nJust uh how is my upcoming year looking well Jupiter you have for planets Phyllis to buddies instead of terrorists so Jupiter is kind of took off for the call conjunctions to palace which has to do with solving problems\nSo get into a kind of study about how to solve your problems and developing strategic thinking and you'll also have Jupiter contact your Mars what's called tire on an series\nSo those are all unusual planets but that that there are gifts from the heavens so Jupiter the king of the gods which has a lot to do with you know success power of positive thinking faith Providence benevolence is really trying to give you some gifts here so hopefully you can use them\nNext up we're going to the Rockies November twenty of Nineteen fifty five let's go to Jane and Florida and she was born to two forty in the morning or mark\nBoy you're going fast November twentieth\nNineteen fifty five or time\nTo forty in the morning ... am to forty AM let's go to Jane in Florida see what's on her mind tied Jane\n... how's everything oh I'm going okay hey any questions for mark or just to reading ... um or how about general meeting All right mark general reading again November twenty of Nineteen fifty five to forty A L okay well I'm after mom away [laughter]\nNow we've got the beginning of Aquarius ... uh where you have some strong energy is George and I do as well million at the beginning of aquarium yeah\nAnd this woman who is called a has the moon with higher on which was discovered Nineteen Seventy seven and tire on is kind of a ... and the mentors so this brings up the idea of getting involved with a group or some kind of group process\nWhere you're kind of building rainbow bridges between your spiritual life and higher destiny and your personality world but definitely team or group were community were global kind of connections you've done this before in the past\nAnd it's still important to keep doing it just like the other caller you're you're going to get the fortunate oh Jupiter energy you have\nAn asteroid called Juno the planet Venus which represents represents love relationship or creative artistry in what's called the north no to the moon which is the moon's orbit there on the edge of terrorists or Jupiter is going to help you\nWith all of a sudden you're carrying energy that the the big issue probably in your life I'm being a sun science scorpion son close to Saturn is you know um you need to be the warrior the answer to the keynote for scorpions warrior I Am in from the battle I emerged triumphant in every sun science Scorpio comes into life\nHaving to be daring and courageous but also off and having a lot of challenges just kind of like ... the need to die to the old and then be reborn but we're Jupiter is moving\nUm is very helpful for you over the next you know next year next Thirteen months it starts a November eighth and continues into the rest of the fall and into the new year so there are suspicious vibes coming up\nOkay any questions Jane I'm her about a\nYear and it's going to make a holiday of um yeah I see that yeah is that going to be thinking well if you don't okay are you using\nTo forty in the morning what's happening is that that planet is making what we call a square or right angle\nTo where the moon is and it's also you you are at an age where you are honest as making a square or right angle to its own position\nSo what you want to avoid his nervousness and anxiety cars in medical astrology or on that planet Iran and says a lot to do with the nervous system\nSo when people are able to sort of meditate or study particularly a cult or metaphysical subjects or things like astrology encountered subjects\nThen you're using your energy is on a higher level your intuition is developing than good things are happening but if you sort of are not on a clear path of what you're doing then if you develop a lot of anxiety and worry and stress you know you're you're going in the wrong direction to go to get back on track\nPlayed cleaning

others do we just started a great their enterprises that that's what I met her to a seven started with the great they're very exciting fate of the yard very beautiful which one do you prefer that we use a grape or enterprises my daughter has just been on the Web\nMaster and Web designer look very very beautiful and all kinds of new things on their super what are you going up to lately well that that's what we've got a full time right well pretty much um\nAnd getting into the world of pod cast beginning thing was with a book and other kinds of things that have been wanting to move into and suddenly now with the state of the our website we're really getting going with that\nWith our executive producer Lisa ... who thinks the world of you says I'm going to give you a special guest he's the mundane astrologer right and I went blind or what are you giving me somebody who's mundane for\nIt it's it's actually uh I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology it's the strategy of nations of world leaders things like eclipse is new moons full moons major planetary alignment\nIn other words it's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I I've been doing that just as long [noise] um so the word again now people think of mundane kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology and personal horoscope type or reading you\nKnow I mean well you're dealing with the same planet fine line there there's a fine line isn't there will\nAgain kind of it's the make or caused them rather than microcosm so people who were in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things are they prefer to look at the big picture of national events current events the way the world is and when I was growing up\nIt's just kind of where I was I read the ... the world book um you know the almanac the world dominance book affects every year we'd come out back in the fifties and sixties is still going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly for sport like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports baseball football and so on\nSo I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office with the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there\nAnd I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation in the world probably because of that particular event\nMark tell us exactly what is ... is\nWell what we're as I said before as above so below this goes back to ancient Egypt the idea of a ... of being called ... or the the thrice great ... which is the actual Egyptian\nGreek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly that was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know I'm of the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy\nWho is also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we'd go back to Greece but really Egypt where there's so much and\nI also studied all kinds of things we regarding Atlanta um when I first got into the whole field I got into reincarnation meditation metaphysics\nLived at the pinpoint community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retro grade planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective he Leo nothing the planets just keep going the ordinary cycles mercury has an eighty eight day forward moving a\nOrbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away and the astrology we use is what we were called geo centered\nEvery so often all the planets now this is not the center moon George but all the planets\nWill tend to appear to go in reverse from our vantage point it's kind of\nTrain station and you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours\nIs going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you and the kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of ... living in your direction but there are like going the other way and it's like confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion\nSo what most people have tuned into all over the decades is\nMercury going in reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth prospective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now into that as an Eighteen if he if someone who went to Google Earth for one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde year and then you click on images\nIt's the little George with all kinds of things like stop signs and road sign saying mercury rich or you don't go here don't go there because people are actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going reverse\nIf you had five different astrologers would you get five different kinds of readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer one way if people who really have studied them to feel like I have four and a half decades\nVery intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same chart of somebody or the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and\nAll this things over the years because I've been on during the election times and often you know people want to hear a prediction ... going to go however astrology really works best\nIn terms of ... ... as you said and he's studied it I'm not just psychology and UFOs and among dollars and everything else but he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use is called before whatever is born at a moment of time\nHas the qualities of that moment of time it's because time\nShould not be thought of as like I'll meet you at ten o'clock in the morning at such and such place\nSo that people think of time has kind of a convenient system it's really a power\nAnd so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts and at the first moment that they take their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around in a great circle\nAnd they're in different signs of the ... and the stroller ... puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of I'm almost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but\n... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and planetary energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above and below so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most ...\nKinda who've been around the horn a long time will come up with a similar result\nArgues psychic too or just draw which\nI'm Glad you asked that question I [laughter] okay if I say out to the public my my son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that sign rather reticent to to be a for instance doing well kind of planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes\nMarketing and advertising and commercial stuff I'm much more focused that's why the Monday and astrology church will things\nAnd so I'm fundamentally um I ... it's interesting you ask me that because I have been very psychic\nBut I don't broadcasted but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most and scientifically in in sports or restaurants\nBack and talk about world events and how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer at his website great barrier enterprises dot com Martin Lorna\nDo forget to watch our TV show\nMe ... George ... just log on to beyond belief dot com\nYour reign of depending on there and then the Asian but that planet the first of the other point of um which is so powerful when America was born because when a Seventeen eighty one when the American revolution was one of the same year that Iran is was cited by William Herschel and ironically and bath England [noise]\nUm but at the rate that planet has just gone into tore okay and tourists as the main line of money\nAnd the New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to may Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and so not yet but in the o five years\nOr you're on a spends about seven years in the fine the planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional\nSoda things coming out of left field shock some surprises Iran us will cross over the sun the solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other thing that I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back\nWhich takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six figure two thousand\nOne of the big things that mundane astrologers of my field people look at these kind of thing was like a a nation's chart nations are born like people if you can locate the birth time of country cities have charts states of the union have charts\nBut America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now what about ...\n[noise] now cryptic does this this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology\nIt's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay that's actually seven hundred and Ninety four years\nThe ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest planets they've been actually looked at by\nPeople going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were chard and believe it or not because they didn't have a all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were stronger is they just didn't have the scientific kind of\nThings that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water\nTo make a what's happening is in Eighteen forty one every Twenty years Jupiter and Saturn have been in earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know it\nBut what's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn marriage together at the beginning of Aquarius and then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn's are going to be an air sides and the point here is the crypto currency is or more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA theory that are more on the line that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we're we're ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes\nYeah I guess you could say that\nA very stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter has created it really beautifully it's cold astro flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit\nSo I've got a couple of things on great burnt prizes in art or a earth Aquarius news zones so now or the chorus news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius news segment and grape or enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening\nWith a Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this will send you can you predict ... I mean today one of his college a range and says I Can't call them a friend but said that he was drunk\nI Will you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother died from alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum or the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes to to some people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not\nUm he could withdraw I mean you know it it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday I don't think it's I think it's going to be hard to prove anything\nThrough um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did\nAnd ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological speaking\n[noise] well okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen but well\nYeah well the thing is is that there's too much unknown but if I ... for the hazard a guess you know I Would just say there's certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else who's going to be nominated\nIn in his in his place so it's not as if suddenly there would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that a squeaky clean\nWell I think that would be because they've been saying that uh um\nBy by you my question Mr learner you think you'll get confirmed Yvonne I'm addict or a logical you speaking\nWell astrological you we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control of used to hazard a guess on that side of the equation\nReduce still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed that you do okay All right that that that was probably that might be one I I I I'll be wrong on going on out I'll say no you at least you took a stand\nRight because when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um were so many of the predictors and you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably went on she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan Wisconsin\nA Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college in Trump won\nSo amazing work now next stop let's talk about Kim Jong un on and his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think it's happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this'll this'll be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other people who come on often about Iran and the world

doing now in in minutes or an agent and you'd\nBetter be minutes on this show bright could you imagine taking hours\nOkay or you have a it's interesting just like\nThe previous caller another moon in areas okay we're which means like from the past ... recent lifetime\nYou've developed leadership skills that you need to bring through their kind of instinctual like being in charge being assertive without being aggressive so there was a kind of forceful part but your son sign Aquarius\nAquariums need to learn through groups through friendships through team kind of activities or global kind of things\nAre where you're ... you ... that are sort of close to your philosophy of life and what's in your heart and you're also born with Pisces rising which adds if it's positive a compassionate empathic kind of energy and also it's like a quality\nInterestingly you like the previous caller have an enormous amount of Capricorn the previous caller had sun a Capricorn you have one two three five less devising Capricorn more than even where you have an Aquarius and Capricorn\nUm is worth Saturn is moving and so you also if you want to do this you're you're moving into a strong career cycle [noise]\nAnd I mentioned earlier you asked me George something really for two to three good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own signed a such a terrorists well here's somebody Donna you're\nBorn with Jupiter and said you Terry and so it's going to be home coming few over the next year a lot of Jupiter and Saturn\nSo do something in the world or something you know where you're making 'em expressing yourself in society and kind of a mover in shaker ... even in your community or neighborhood or your state you know to do something that you feel a significant an end worthwhile\nAlright Don good luck to you hope everything works out so amazing mark how you're able to pinpoint individuals with astrology well\nBecause it's kind of like if if I were a doctor okay and what I'm doing if you just if you said okay this person needs advice about their chest area and you put an x-ray in front of me I just start talking you know the doctors thing whatever it is and it's right then you'd say okay uh looked serious enough that\nYou know we're going to have to put you on antibiotics and then go back and forth a little bit for how long you know and then come back to me it could be a pneumonia it might be bronchitis will will have to take you know\nHave have you do some you know see what happens so it's kind of like a Rorschach test the chart is\nIt's so magical but it's like again if this were a beginner and they they'd be looking around and saying what do I do you know I see that there's the symbol for Aquarius there's Pisces there's some Capricorn book it would be like ... to\nThe but when you have done it for forty six years you know is there like on the website I have what's called the cosmic calendar which used to be and walk on the planet earth and now it's independent and that's where people can\nSee what's in the sky every day and they can they can subscribe you know for a year or two and we even have a new thing where they can try it for one week for less ... less than a dollar or a month or less than ten dollars it's it's kind of part of the new great there\nWell that's fantastic that's you've been doing this for so long that you know I I think it's important for people to chart themselves right into the sea the direction they're going for advice\nMy whole goal has always been George again this part of my ... when I when I Do a consultation\nLove to have them come back hey I'd like to do a deeper thing and you know I can do charts of compatibility with a loved one or a parent and child\nBut my goal is to get them so excited that ... years later they would come back and say you know you did my reading and I started studying I'm doing it on my own if I can do that that is the greatest thing that I could do\nCouples ever come to you mark to say are we compatible but\nWell I Will say this first of all I don't do this anymore\nBut I used to do a lot of marriage turning really ... but the thing is it's an it's very fine tuned I'm there we have ... we have reports that we sell coal friends and lovers and there's something called ...\nSo I I Would tell people to go to our strategy you poor thing and they can put in their birth data and get that relatively quickly for me to do things is ... you know it's more expensive you have to do to charge you gotta get background information both people but basically astrologers have been doing this for a long time\nAnd it's and it's like you look at Venus and Mars proponents of love and or the sun and moons matching up and all the different climates but it's quite complex but you can do it\nAre you like a human ... card [laughter]\nWell I've created to to row decks one with my ex wife each uh uh we did in ... which have sold well over a hundred thousand copies for the last like almost Thirty years so many different languages and she has done an enormous amount of\nPromotion of that and then I did baseball tomorrow and I just ran into the Gulf War films the other day I hadn't seen her a while and that has not sold all that well because the publishers sort of we're doing calendars but they had never done a terrific project so I've done to row longer than I've done astrology\nI'm going to give you our next to special callers birth said first of all November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight we're going to Bradley in Illinois Bradley do you know where you were born\nThough Illinois and build on ... well now how about a time any idea I'm I'm not sure the day time okay do you have a question for mark who just want him to get going here\nUm I like the whole Spiro aspect to you know like you know our nation and also another thing like that but I mean our you know make a difference you know are you are and things as well\nUh I don't study Chinese now I just wanted to make a you know I Am aware of the five different elements and those kinds of things in the you know the toilet ... the the birthdays that kind of but um what I Need to know was was it Nineteen eighty eight\nNineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight okay hold on one second okay and while you're doing that we've got a couple of minutes before the break mark and we'll take some more calls when we come back later on tonight by the way we're going to be talking about flying saucers from beyond the earth would Gordon Moore go ahead mark\nOkay so November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight I'm just putting in like close to sunrise this person is a sun science Scorpio but you're not going to believe is the third time in a row we looked like we have another mood in areas that that is really took that's\nNot so unusual that yeah\nI mean there are twelve times three callers all within areas man\nThat's my that's my audience\nSo again we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit its own zero point of varies on December thirty one and New Years which is what I said you know it's it's traditionally a planet of war but it can also be a planet of energy a planet of passion\nFor a sports exercise and this person who just called um has the moon and areas conjunction Mars and he's the son science Scorpio and traditionally Scorpio is also ruled by Mars was considered to the ancient Mars is night fine because it ruled the water side to this person\nI'm a lot of enduring energy that comes through the Scorpio world and currently Jupiter is making a ... a across thing just finished three times on\nThis individual is Marjorie so he the fact that he made it through on this is probably part of Jupiter offering a kind of blessing just that he's on here and again I Would say to him he also has Capricorn strong\nTo do some kind of a study in metaphysics philosophy um people have his son find Scorpio need to really get into deep things\nI'm sort of in a hot and heavy weight and stay with it\nTo pick lottery numbers mark\nI'm I I'm I often enter into the different lotteries Powerball so on a five years ago I had four out of the five numbers are horrible didn't show up wow this is I've come that would have been almost two

A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com call now\n[noise]\n\nWe are back with mark and learn or our final segment as website great bear enterprises dot com part does the media ride shooting star of sex anybody's astrological chart\n[laughter] um [noise] I don't know that that would actually do something although my favorite magazine is astronomy ya gotta Wisconsin I don't know if you get it it's beautiful and credible\nGotten it for a long time and they just had the previous issue where there's a a free program I don't remember exactly where it is I have in order to get [noise]\nWhich I think is really unique way that the people can see\n'em they can plot like around America around the world when the moon would a cult of planet or star and even\nAn asteroid so it's sort of comes close to what you're asking about and that's actually a software program so in the software world these are amazing things but media you know we have the you know the different kind of media storms that happen every so often like this one in August you know the Perseids and different ones\nUm there there may be some effect with some people I think more psychic lead the people who like are prone to\nRespond to earth changes you know some people tune in to earthquakes and animals and you you know things like that so I'm anything's possible but it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nAll right let's go back to the final coal series they line up for you or your next birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon a birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona Tucson how are you Albert\nHey good evening George good evening mark\nHappy I'm coming birthday to you my friend\nOh well thank you and other year oh there you know\nThey keep clicking by do you have a question for mark I just want him to do reading for you\nOr he can do or reading my question would have been kind of in a financial limbo for the last year so I was wondering if that was going to change and the other question is about you know it's love and money\nThe money go ahead Mr learner\nUh by the way I did follow the aries three people in a row because there's something called the part a fortune in Arabic strategy which was developed a thousand years ago they were all mathematically oriented that that's where we get algebra and there's what's called parts like the part of the ... part of marriage and so it was something called apart a fortune\nAnd throughout the entire segment there\nThe part of fortune for Los Angeles and out on the west coast was an areas the sign that the moon was showing up in the part of the fortunes very connected to the moon\nAnd the moon was also is the ... of the cancer and is rising in the first house of self expression which is the kind of archetype all areas area so it was a reason that happened will this fellow now has a ...\nAnd ... is from from the past from another life or other existence is on the ...\nAngel thing I'm more of sort of a need for compassion may be working in religion and philosophy behind the scenes and it's not ... not very much of a mover and shake her in the world\nSo as an individual people who've Pisces moon come in and they're more impact and pap okay for good or for ill okay and some people with strong Pisces moon can get sort of pulled into they can become vulnerable you know to other people and lose their way but\nThe sun side of this individual is the sign of a partnership Libra\nAnd he also has Neptune mercury and Venus\nThere in that science so as far as relationship is concerned the keynote esoteric leave for labor is I Choose the way that leads ... between the two great lines of force and my mentor\nI'm dating Roger talked about libor as the great pyramid following the mystery of the things which is really Leo in Virgo the body of a lie on the head of a it'd be a woman\nAnd so the whole Egyptian mystery kind of tradition it goes back to the summertime is of cancer Leo Virgo and lever and so so basically spiritually\nThis person to study everything about the great pyramid and that would be very good because there's a lot of more about mysteries even Jesus going and being a potentially and initiated you know two thousand years ago during those last few years from you know from age twelve or Thirteen to thirty three\nGoing all around the world to India possibly to Egypt going to a glass to bury and in England I mean these are kind of\nBut may very well have happened so study the great pyramid study Egypt a and get into things like reincarnation metaphysics that might help\nAlright anything else they're Elbert no just\nUh how is my upcoming year looking well Jupiter you have for planets flustered buddies incentive to terrorists so Jupiter is kind of tick off what are called conjunctions to palace which has to do with solving problems\nTo get into a kind of study about how to solve your problems in developing strategic thinking and you'll also have Jupiter contact your Mars what's called tire on and series\nSo those are all unusual planets but that that their gifts from the heavens so Jupiter the king of the gods which has a lot to do with you know success power of positive thinking faith Providence benevolence is really trying to give you some gifts here so hopefully you can use them\nNext up we're going to the Rockies November twenty of Nineteen fifty five let's go to Jane in Florida and she was born to two forty in the morning or mark\nBoy you're going fast November twentieth Nineteen fifty five or time\nTo forty in the morning ... am to forty a on let's go to Jane in Florida see what's on her mind tied Jane\n... how's everything oh I'm going okay hey any questions for mark or just reading um or how general meeting All right\nMark general reading again November twenty of Nineteen fifty five to forty a\nL okay well um kept her mom away [laughter] well\nWe've got the beginning of Aquarius ... um where you have some strong energy is George and I do as well ... at the beginning of Aquarius sale\nAnd this woman who is called a has the moon with higher on which was discovered Nineteen Seventy seven and tire on is kind of a ... so this brings up the idea\nOf getting involved with a group or some kind of group process would be really good for the soul spiritual standpoint where you're kind of building\nRainbow bridges between your spiritual life and higher destiny and your personality world but definitely team or group\nSince you've done this before in the past and it's still important to keep doing it just like the other caller you're you're going to get the fortunate Jupiter energy you have\nAn asteroid called Juno the planet Venus which represents represents love relationship a creative artistry in what's called the north no to the moon which is the moon's orbit there on the edge of terrorists or Jupiter is going to help you\nWith all the ... energy that the the big issue probably in your life I'm being a sun science Scorpio and son close to Saturn\nIs you know you need to be the warrior the answer to the keynote for scorpions warrior I Am in from the battle I emerged triumphant in every suns science Scorpio comes into life\nHaving to be daring and courageous but also off and having a lot of um challenges just kind of like the need to die to the old and then be reborn but we're Jupiter is moving\nUm is very helpful for you over the next you know next year next Thirteen months it starts a November eighth and continues into the rest of the fall and into the new year so there are are suspicious vibes coming up\nOkay any questions Jane\nUm how 'bout um you're going to make a holiday of um yeah I see that yeah oh is that going to be thinking well if you\nDon't okay using to forty in the morning what's happening is that that planet is making what we call a square or right angle\nTo where the moon is and it's also you're at an age where you're honest is making a square or right angle to its own position\nSo what you want to avoid his nervousness and anxiety because in medical astrology or on that planet Iran and says a lot to do with the nervous system\nSo when people are able to sort of meditate or study particularly a cult or metaphysical subjects or things like astrology encountered subjects than you're using your energy is on a higher level your intuition is developing than good things are happening but if you sort of\nAre not on a clear path of what you're doing then if you develop a lot of anxiety and worry and stress you know you're you're going in the wrong direction together get back on track", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Coosada", "day": "02"}
