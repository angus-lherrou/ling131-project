L. A. and the generic version of it ... the black box drug\nLike food poisoning and from the moment that drug was injected within days Ralph both physical and mental condition began to deteriorate and there are many many many cases of this that can be found on the Internet\n[noise] and when you see it begin to deteriorate physically and mentally did you notice that change with him\nAbsolutely within a day or two he and one of his medical school room mates had done research\nAnd the changes I noticed or his anxiety began to increase it began to complain of strange pains that he had never had before and this began a flow deterioration that I Would call something like this doing this whole lot of the human body\nAnd at this point rough took his life\n[noise] over the course of a ... early ... Seventeen he was I brought him back home to St Louis and uh he made three attempts on his life\nTo take themselves out of this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain and from what I understand the form of anxiety times a hundred\nMen on his last attempt tea was successful and um [noise] I did hold his hand and was there and he passed away\nHow old wants the Johnson he was twenty [noise] and how did he take his life\nHe tried with two other attempts that were unsuccessful\nBut on the last attempt a he used a gun and at that time I wasn't there he sent me a text that really began the marking over a year but the tax came to me at exactly eleven eleven\nAnd that's where we are going to talk about tonight the ... that have occurred for you especially after this tragedy occurred I mean I remember being in St Louis when I heard about this\nAnd uh it was a it was shocking situation for anybody to have to go through a ... it it is my biggest nightmare of course as a parent to lose your child before before you go\nAnd I could only what you were going through at that time with this kind of pain but the synchronous cities then started so tell us a little bit about the name Institute and then twenty two which is the name of your book\n[noise] I I looked at that tax George again and again and again and in some way I've found solid and connecting with fat laugh taxed\nAnd as I began to stare at it again and again it occurred to me eleven eleven well Ralph was born on two twenty two [laughter] and so the number twenty two began to resonate with me a firm that was the beginning point I Would say of that resignation\nI Want to tell our audience does a little ... year when I was talking with Jonathan several weeks ago about this situation in his book and of course the tragedy that occurred now he had mentioned that you know his his son roles\nA was a you know just a delightful young guy and he's is used to name Gabriel of course uh you took that name as well did you not\nI did Ralph middle name was Gabriel and so I changed my middle name to Gabriel I felt the universe and now one this and doing that it was symbolic was spiritual and um brought me significant meaning\nAnd on and I was talking to Jonathan and I said to my dad's name was ...\nTwenty seconds which is the same date to Ralph was born in these weird synchronous he started coming up all over again and Jonathan's eyes just opened up and and everything else do you believe that your son is Cindy ... messages Jonathan through these strange occurrences\n[noise] I I Do believe that I I've always been a rational analytical regimented person and in my personal life in my profession\nAnd Avi aiding and\nWith the pain of what happened it began to open up my thought process and I said wait a minute there's just got to be more and I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality and began to read I began to study\nA I've been studying the ancient ... text in Hebrew I've looked through other religions and mystical world and I do believe that in finance is communicating with me\n[noise] what message do you sing to Ralph is trying to pass on to you what does he want you to know\n[noise] I find comfort in knowing that he's letting me know that the existence of him has not seized\nLife on earth for him has seized but the existence in the cosmic soup if you will does not stop and that brought me tremendous comfort\nI I was going to say it it must be in a very strange way of course to give you the kind of comfort to know that his existence continues that he's out\nThere somewhere ah in trying to get you little messages every once in a while or just to make you aware that you know hey Dan I'm here\n[noise] well you know it it hasn't been always once in a while sometimes it's a little more frequent uh about\nTwo weeks ago I've been wearing his watch that I gave him on his twentieth birthday which is an automatic watch okay and I've been wearing it for the better of course of a year and a half [noise] I've not touched it it always keeps the correct time ten days ago I woke up I put on the watch I got my car I went to work and my watch\nWas twenty two minutes behind\nAll\nI had to look at it a few times but it was twenty two men and\nDo you get behind the car and you look in a license plate and you see twenty two there to do these numbers pop up all over the place\nYou know they do pop up to me and at times I think they're popping up and at times I think they're not coincidences [laughter] so I really created a word for myself out of coincidences I'm calling them coincide and says\nBecause as it on a recent trip to Los Angeles and I'm thinking a lot about him and the hotel I check into and they hand me a key and I walk up to the room and the room number is to twenty two\nCheese random they just give it to you correct you you didn't request it\n[noise] but I don't think is random I'm I have removed random from my thought\nRight yeah I mean it might be random on the hotels side but somebody else's directing this\nThat these stock patterns Jonathan stay with us we're going to come back in the ... and talk more

that have occurred since rough tragically passed on\nJonathan I Know how tough this was for you when this tragedy occurred\nGeorge I'm I'm definitely doing better one of the things that's really help to me is to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the infinite and in my own simple explanation\nI don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings has disability [noise]\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body\nAnd so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite and so in meditative thought in thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infant its own were each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat did you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\nI have to say that I I question that I didn't think about it much\nAnd ever since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nKind of the goals really did we get to them in a second thought three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the drivers situation what happened there\nSo about eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want\nAnd he looked at me in a very strange stare and said\nI'll just tell them Ralph's on it and I looked and I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with and he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said no she how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love that about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon and I thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n[laughter] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and said we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nGets timing in secret as you get and then you had an occurrence would some strange bedroom lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty\nAnd the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with may occur in the lights back\nBut the light switch back down and put it back up put it back down and they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off and at that time I left the house and just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nIt was a point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry\nUm [noise] I don't I don't fault Tam I have struggled to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shield it themselves from any and all liability from every American citizen\nWhile they're they're protected by federal law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJonathan was was we're all subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student ah frequently making jokes he was just if you ask his friends they would portray just the most honest\nI'm likeable young man you could you could think of\nNow to go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stand to take some stuff uh you know they go to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were these symptoms for him to go to the hospital\nI I think I think he was vomiting proof usually there was a lot of blood he went out with his friends who are all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that cold [noise] well\nI got the call after the medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOkay let's go to some culture for your Jonathan let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington questioner story Hi

Marion and all of that because it does come up a lot\nWhat exactly are rogue planet how can a planet be wandering in the universe between sellers systems in galaxy\nThere certainly are these wandering planets rogue planets\nAnd they come about from the same sort of reason that we think that planet nine is out there they certainly formed around a star just like our planet stood and then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other and one of them got tossed out\nUsually the smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one and in our case we think that that happened to planet nine but planet nine didn't get tossed quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge but if if it had gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter it could've been completely injected from our solar system\nIn which case it would just be wandering through space and so it is\nAbsolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it\nWhen people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there's a giant planet that is going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracies stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for general world audience why some the masses like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planets with out every astronomer on for knowing\nIf something like ... I don't know what the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally you'll read the headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system [noise]\nSo if it were really coming it would be so bright\nThat you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming we wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping secrets\nAnd it would've been visible to every backyard astronomer with the telescope for the past decade and it would have been visible to every professional astronomer for the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know anywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times the mass of our earth were even out past Pluto out in the ... what would be the obvious observation all changes ... nations in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers are being apart meaning the planets that we know of but it has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets and you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven now seven times amounts of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun and the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has a tremendous effect on the planet and the solar system and nobody sits around and there's worry that Jupiter is certainly going to come destroy us\nPlanet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter's so it's a fact that it's really minimal one effect that it does have is that over four billion years it is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planets but even that is just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii in November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible to talk with you in December about what you might find or do you have to wait to do papers or\nJust the way the process works as well go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks to amongst to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data and then at that point will announce its existence as soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that it's really there\nAnd then will announce its existence right of ways we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] so January I'm twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIs possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue and my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know what you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it'll take us another ten years I think it will take us one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nThat barrier habit Oregon right from the manana and discovered that in turn those perturbation of those half a dozen bodies that are all kind of gathered together at where the guy prevailed in a cloud in that area\nAnd I think one of the most important part of doing the research project with these scientists that I had no confusion about the fact that if there was something massive\nThat we're trying to move into our solar system what it's called the inner solar system from a mercury\nI Know Neptune and urine is our because Pluto or been dumbed down to a door planet out in the hyper belt\nThat there's nothing that could be out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity that that's the thing about

that for conversations and Linda because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting that even if\nShe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that there could be a

most of the islands in the south Pacific\nAlso older you've seen the Indian Ocean and many Caribbean countries\nAnd then there are very low lying countries like Bangladesh where the bulk of the population very close to sea level Nigeria has huge populations Roger street level but you know sodas most of the world [noise] I Know in the United states also has an enormous populations right at the coast\nIn where in Alaska\nIn Alaska you have an interesting problem where it's it's a combination of rising sea levels and melting ice and the ice ... to the shorelines from the waves from the ocean\nAnd without the ice the waiters can reach the shore and more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels and so a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the berries trade area many of them are already having to be evacuated and moved to higher ground oh it's not so much the north slope of the south\nAnd west coasts and who is paying for that\nI Believe that the combination of federal and state governments\nAlready moving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground yeah\nAnd he is that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nAnd there's not been so much evacuation of the coast there's been more what used to be rare flooding events that are now becoming quite common\nSo I think that there is likely to have to be evacuation in the next couple decades of at least some places there's an island does not speak for example between Maryland and Virginia more than half of it was already going\nTo have seen the water come up through the dreams skin to Charleston South Carolina and Virginia where nuisance flooding there was very rare as it comes so commonplace that governments\nIt's the flooding is so routine then Florida it's been some of the worst flooding of street in the southeast part of the state\nHas become fairly routine ... as continued and we've seen an acceleration because both the Greenland\nAnd Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than was expected just a decade ago and dump more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing over the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from computer models and then watch the models\nHas often been too conservative and things are happening faster than the models project\nCan you give an example of what has been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the boss of the ice in the Arctic went like two or three times faster than the models protect us\nIs the Arctic has melted two to three times faster than the computer's projected already by twenty Eighteen is that a harbinger of the fact that it's likely me warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in the Arctic\nWell we've been observing from satellite that melting of the Greenland ice is has been accelerating so that is definitely a worry\nIt is extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become destabilized based on say melting from the top with water slipping down through cracks in the ice sheet and lubricating the below\nYou know when we worry because the warming has been so fast in the Arctic that the acceleration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty Eighteen what would you project we will be seeing as more dramatic weather events between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater probability of drought greater likelihood of high fire conditions and we see flooding in the east as you get more extreme heavy rainfall events\nAnd the more heat waves everywhere around the country\nAnd well even the sheet extremes going up in metropolitan areas around the country so things like Chicago in the Nineteen nineties having a severe heat wave that killed thousands of people\nThat kind of thing that would have been you know maybe every fifty years or so that will start to become more and more frequent and it'll begin to happen maybe if a decade or so where places like Phoenix will fill hit extreme heat for Phoenix", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year":
