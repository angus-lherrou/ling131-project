and I say I'm really not interested and at that moment I don't think I had much of a choice because my constant George realized my sister and I are in trouble\nCame in poll of both out and kind of an ceremonies way through it on the beach and that was back in my body\nBut I wanted to tell you that it was a glorious experience I've had many that was really one of the first and I I learned a lot from that I learned not to let my son to teach me to swim for one thing that's probably in the mail message from that\nExactly it's a scary thing I got to tell you the same thing happened to me when I was a kid except I didn't have an ... experience I was with my father's brother my uncle he was the twins and we're walking in a lake\nAnd ah I'm side by side next to my uncle and uh I hit a hole in this lake in just like you don't I went I must have been about eight years old Joyce and I'm going I and I thought this is it I'm dead\n[laughter] and now we're back something\nBeyond me back up I popped right back up and then my uncle didn't even know I went under just kept walking [laughter] put it was the weirdest feeling but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nCorrect I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but I was home lots of times\nOh thank you I was at the world Trade Center when nine out of the car because my husband and I had an apartment very club through like a thousand feet from from the world Trade Center and we moved there about a month before buildings came down gosh\nYeah is there a month and on the day we moved and Jack and I looked up and the world Trade Center was towering all round little building on liberty cart and ah I said you know we had to each other boy this thing comes down we're finished well exactly a month later they'd come down as you know and we were\nWe had to leave the building and because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave\nBut we came back a few days later when save\nAnd I had the most phenomenal experience and that's my website where I'm going to happen I I actually had gone to sleep and I was awake and until to go into the living room and to help people to cross over because they were coming through that had created a portal in my building and then my apartment\nAnd the people who were had just died or coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty that was Battery Park\nSo that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people see they just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still love that area Joyce\nWe saw that apartment when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida but uh just like so many incredible things have people who were just trying to remember some of the things that happened to them I think most people say most\nWrite them down recording your dreams as I'm sure your your next guest has got to tell us\nBut write everything down trying to analyze what you're experiencing I'm the best way to develop your yes pay is to try to remember and to try to record which are experiencing and really happen that way and open up more of that that consciousness you'll be able to help other people as well\nSo that's that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences I had a I don't know if I should if you're ready for me to tell you another one of one mind phenomenal experiences about a\nLot of low yeah sure absolutely OK George thank you [laughter] I had never heard of ... but uh I had an odd about\nMaybe four years ago I had this out and party experience where I did astro travel which I had really no memory of doing ever before I think we all travel and we just forget it but we don't know about it but this was unusual because I went to um a Tibetan Ramos story and to say this\nLama whose name was ... and you know in Tibet George on the day the baby is born that's the first name he was born on a Tuesday so same Tuesday lob sayings I can name is rampant and if you go to his website it's a lot saying ramp a dot org\nBut he came to me and I went on this phenomenal trip\nTo his story and he had a the ability to answer many of my question is that this\nMan had many walking experiences supposedly he was over many hundreds of years of age he had taken different bodies on the last one more out he took a new body on and he was living as an Englishman\nAnd then finally carnation on the earth and Nineteen eighties so\nI was at Islam is Terry and it was phenomenal and I came back to my body brought me back and I was waking up he said to me don't forget my name and I had never heard I couldn't remember it but my husband was there and I said check before I wake up please write this down and\nI spelled it out ... and I misspelled it slightly put it in age on it or it didn't belong and then he would blow up things gone but I went to his website and that was blown away because he has written maybe a couple of hundred books that are free anyone\nGo to the ... of\nExtremely cell and just really an amazing amazing man and not only was he a doctor but he was also it just so many different incarnations it makes you realize that we don't really have to die I said to Maine also was locking and George do you believe that that's possible he can take on\nA further uh incarnation\nI

most fulfilling aspect of what you do\nI think the medium ship card the sidekick medium should part ... where people are killed when they receive messages in the middle of drunk so they realize that those people are not really just dead or a fixed or whatever they may be thinking because really\nI Love church and religious organizations but they don't do it was a big favor or they don't say that person's doing really well so I think that would be my primary methods for people to know that when you cross over ... shouldn't\nGo into a place of grief let them be joy for on the other side and enjoy the healing and wellness with them so that that's really important to the medium ship brings and that ability to let people know that their loved ones doing fine\nThose the spirit never come to you and say the monies and the bag under the shoe box\nSure they do stuff like that\nYeah it's a lot of things and uh if you have before you go for this applies to everyone [laughter] before you go to

husband was here he took a lot of pictures here we've had a camera eye to eye on his neck I took a lot of pictures so I have a lot of fear of photography\nI have a lot of or I have a lot of weird things going on and it's so interesting George maybe can tell me that the reason why we're in this comes out on film but it doesn't come out with just the human eye thing at a wife has such a difference I think\nThere is a huge difference in it's very strange because for some reason the camera picks up\n... or ... just about everything that you can see with the human eye I mean I guess were restricted to the ... to see things at a certain level a word that camera individually and otherwise picks it up\nRight and it's so odd and it was a cell phone really to the same degree that irregular ah thirty five millimeter camera would would a present it's the same thing so I have yet to figure that out spirited not tell me why but other than the fact that the uh\nThe photographer scientific photography has the ability to not have ... and ...\nNot good you know you're not being tricked by some demon or something that that is to train the deceased person somebody\nThat's a great question because if you do any kind of spirit work or you have any kind of messages or he received anything at all you always have to have a blessing first test the spirits you say really are you of God and that's really what I Would say and that's what I Would recommend everyone's saying before they become involved in this kind of work at all\nSo you always say are you of God and that's what I Would suggest and then team it's kind of come in and they will not come in or if you have any kind of threat around you or you're afraid if anything you know that they will not get past that barrier and if you're religious you say the name of Jesus Christ or whatever you can relate to\nHave you ever witnessed an exorcist\nNo other than the movie which I did not like because books fell off the

Lee inclined as well\nUp until the age of six or seven we have great pets I recall we have a dream intuitive abilities and then we start school\nAnd then kind of the honeymoon end the intuition things kind of a clamp down you don't have that free reign\nAnd children are autistic are very very psychic and a lot of the kids come and now they're still on the children those kids are extraordinary so I don't think that's a good question I don't even know what the [laughter] I wanted to give you that that's the case\nSay what you can only tell his website is linked up and goes to goes to a um dot com

back our final segment with Joyce killer of course the sidekick and your phone calls will will do some readings Joyce with everything that you do in your field what would you say has been the most fulfilling aspect of what you do\nI think the media makes it hard to say medium ... where people are ... when they receive messages in the middle of drunk so they realize that the people I'm not really just dead or fixed or whatever they may be thinking because really I Love church and religious organizations but they don't do a big favor or they don't say that\nPerson's doing really well so I think that would be my primary methods for people to know that when you cross over ... shouldn't\nGo into a place of grief let them be joy for on the other side and and joining a health and wellness with them so that that's really important to the medium ship brings in that ability to let people know that their loved ones doing fine\nDoes the spirit never come to you and say the monies and the bag under the shoe bar\nThey they do stuff like that\nYeah it's a lot of things and uh if you have before he goes it doesn't apply to everyone [laughter] before you go to sleep at night\nYou ask say please tell me if you continue to ask hey where is it usually you get an answer if you like maybe three times four times she should get an answer just really hang in there with it and be diligent and your request keep asking\nWe were talking about spirit photography and you've got some of them have you taken the pictures or other just been given to you\nWell when my husband was here he took a lot of pictures here we've had a camera eye to eye on his neck I took a lot of pictures so I have a lot of very photography I have a lot of or I have a lot of things going on and it's so interesting George maybe you can tell me that\nThe reason why we're in this comes out on film but it doesn't come out with just the human eye thing at a wife has such a difference I think\nThere's just so huge difference and it's very strange because for some reason the camera picks up\n... or ... just about everything that you can see with the human eye I mean I guess were restricted to ... to see things at a certain level of war the camera individually and otherwise picks it up\nRight and it's so odd and it was a cell phone or really to the same degree that irregular ah thirty five millimeter camera would would a present it's the same thing so I have yet to figure that out spirited not told me why but other than the fact that the a photographer\nIt does not have and that's the only answer I could come up with so far is not good\nYou know you're not being tricked by some demon or something that that is to train the deceased person somebody\nThat's a great question because if you do any kind of spirit work or you have any kind of messages or he received anything at all you always have to have a blessing first test the spirits you say really are you of God and that's really what I Would say and that's what I Would recommend everyone thing before they become involved in this kind of work at all\nSo you always say are you of God and that's what I Would suggest and then team is can come in and they will not come in or if you have any kind of threat around you or you're afraid if anything you know that they will not get past that barrier\nAnd if you're religious you say the name of Jesus Christ or whatever you can relate to\nHave you ever witnessed an exorcist\nNo other than the movie which I did not like because books fell off the shelf by themselves and very unsettling so it's not a place that I Would want to go to I I Try to avoid darkness and\nYou don't play with the ... board\nNo and I know your feelings about to reach a point and I agree with you I have a picture in my seven steps having book about my ... I did a terrible thing when my son was young I mean that is pain a ... and my brother that we're using a weed you brought in my living room and I was sitting on the couch watching them\nAnd yeah we were\nAll very young at that time and my husband took a picture of it and you can see over my shoulder looking in the window behind me from outside a team and say\nOh really that's in my book and stuff\nThat's going to the phones next up Greg in North Hollywood, California November twenty six Nineteen fifty seven November twenty six Ninety seven ... got a birthday coming up I grabbed\nOut a way Hey Greg\nPointed to test your ability because over the past few decades has meant the psychics and maybe a handful [laughter]\nActually came up with predictions by saying like a you know what what's the Toyota Corona during that time I got there and all this but the the others has worked off of the ... do you think oh you should be speaker and this and that that's\nHow I should be anything but I'm telling you to death I Will say one thing about you\nYou have at the time if you look at Mars signed a Scorpio so you love secrets\nAnd you'd be a great detective and you're always looking for this solving mysteries I Will say that to you and you know you you do it very well and you basically very skeptical which is great because that's how you get answers and true so great because it's something I can do for you\nYeah I Wonder if you've been the predicting wise or something coming up from a career or a my income wise a change to make it better [laughter]\nWell you know what I just mentioned that you love mysteries [laughter] have you ever done any kind of forensic sciences or technology or anything along those lines like detective work anything like that\nNo I Do watch a lot of these uh game shows where you got to get the words\n[laughter] that's a good start well are you starting a new career\nI'm not really I I've been in a career but then it's freelance or independent contract work for the you know sometimes it's slow or just depending on\nWhat I Would say to you is if you want to find out what's really a sole purpose and I feel that it's discovering mysteries you should really following along those lines you know just kind of study forensics bed and when you're not doing construction\nAnd you're going to find that you have a whole part of your brain it's it's really exciting if you're honest person and you love honesty and a lot of people in this field an honest so thank you for saying that Greg\n... works out for you speaking of honesty Joyce you see something bad will you tell that person\nIn like a national handling accident or an accent and I think I'd tell them about maybe you can avoid it\nYes I had a very very very bad accident a few years ago because I did not listen guy\nTold me not to go out for twenty four hours and I was all set to stay home but someone came on and sit down that we have to go to the beach we have to do that for that or who really horrendous accident guide to tell you and if you're not told you how the accident anyway then it's supposed to happen like you charge I don't believe in accidents\nNo or you know when you lose look back at the movie the Christmas carol was Scrooge is looking in the window with the ghost of the future spirit or these things that will be or could be ... and that's that's an interesting question do you think we have the ability to change our destiny\nI think as you raise your consciousness grow and awareness and you grow in truth and love and light and understanding you absolutely can that's why we're here with the it's a school this is one big school dj origin you know it\nAnd a tearful lessons you too well you know you don't have to experience something really nasty bypass it\nLet's go to bone in Wichita, Kansas bowl July twenty eight Nineteen eighty four July twenty eight Nineteen eighty four high bowl welcome to the program\nGeorge George hey that's eighty part is that correct yep okay very good about what's happening what can we do for you [noise]\nUm I just have a question for you um about three months before I was born a my great grandmother was passing away from cancer and she told my parents she had to leave this world should make room for me\nUm and then last year uh me and my you know they had a child and about three months before he was born my grandmother passed away I was really close to her um I didn't know if that was something that happened very often or if it's like a transfer of energy type thing\nI think if it happens like Ninety nine percent of the time I think it's so brilliant grab a bottle that you've said that because there's always exactly what you said oh you don't always have to have a death but usually cars like one leaves and one comes in and you know what it doesn't have to be the same spirit usually is not I don't believe it is\nSo what you said it's extremely accurate and um for you about born seven twenty eight eighty four is that\nCorrect yep okay\nYou don't have the most time male so you're a great showman should get out there and let the world know what you're all about I mean but you
