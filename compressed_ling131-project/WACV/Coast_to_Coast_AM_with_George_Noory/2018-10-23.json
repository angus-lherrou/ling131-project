robotic planetary missions Senate space astronomy missions they work in that field is epic bought the human spaceflight program and\nMoon but they're not even planning a reasonable plan to do that and um so I think it's gonna be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy the privatization is taking off the way it is and that NASA is kind of like fading away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA's human spaceflight program is dysfunctional ah I'm not happy about that at all\nUm the uh you know I ... it would be disastrous NASA's robotic space flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program I mean that storm cabin in the Nineteen sixties doing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I I was at a conference in Florida a month ago or a high level NASA official got actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said\nWe're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThem and what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got it may be there waiting for all the people that can remember that to die off so they can help people they did it the first time\nAnd that's been alone Robert will make all the people who do that we went to the moon jumper and joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood\nUm and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it's it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is gonna be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add proportion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission I mean let let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay\n[laughter] the the the ...\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal\nI Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're going to have to pay to build the building and you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill passed on that [laughter] and the and this thing\nIs that I buy the swamp line you'd probably sell me what I mean I buy the swarm play and you'd probably want to sell\nMe a lot better off with the swamp land then with this ... [laughter] well\nYou wouldn't be ISIL is doing what he's doing fell ... base sex are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching nests are just kind of not do much anymore with manned space flights and it's it's just a poignant Robert it really is\nIt is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and that government built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\n... and ... and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible\nUm I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we've had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects on it and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nA chaos and the the the you know so\nNo I was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while\nWould come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who preceded us uh you know wanting to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the moon\nI was hoping Brian and spine would do that but he didn't he just went along\nAnd I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flight of one of the falcons a at night and then it came back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the guys that night\nThat they didn't know what it was they thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was spectacular to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time uh because sure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get them to be reusable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that most kids done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduce the cost of space launch by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram before must now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram traumatic\nIt's dramatic it's protect color and it was done on a shoestring compared to [noise] um what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems\nI mean it was done like from one tenth the money in one third of the time that any one of ... was accepting would be normal and this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space and a number of other advanced fields that people thought were hopeless uh so okay Bezos has his own money he's got blue origin but we now have three small launch companies a firefly\nA vector space um\nElectron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars a two to field a small launch systems\nAnd it even goes beyond the the us space industry we now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded\nBecause people you know they were looking at fusion parents all this is just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and this is another Twenty years\nAnd but people than say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the ...\nAnd um I gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and\nI can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around the table and he sent all of us\nYou know when fusion power spine and develop it's not going to be in a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yep well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably a start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what is going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next dollar will take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours left the coast to coast\nAlways on your bones and you'll be happy to know the ... website is no optimized rule users just point your iPhone or Android rose\n\nUh okay look um the thing to know about Iran is is this okay on the one side he well he he's very driven is very hard working uh uh and he he's a\nDriven to want to do something great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he was about uh\nNow he he he really wants to do he he wants to go down in the history books for doing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that\nHe doesn't just want to do great deeds he wants eternal gory for doing great so he's not Mother Teresa can be selfish and he he and he certainly um\nI'm not above using people ah and you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well why keep getting angry that he couldn't be the one that\nThe other side of it so you know a ... you know there is [noise] um\n... you know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing ... teaches eagle about\nBut it's not in fact he ego it's it's you know if you've read Greek mythology like the ...\nThis is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth you know uh\nWhen it gets that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core\nTo to fight the French because he he even though I mean the odds of more against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone so you know that's mosque to AT T and um and and and so\nBut really um [noise] you know that that's the classical motives with a hero okay so\nI I think must because the hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant who goes out a ... looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh that that's what he's about but\nYou know um how would you can just ... Robert Well Jeff Bezos has much calmer a much more laid back um I don't know these cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh\nAnd if you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect at a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday and um\nThe company takes chances and thus far um they're winning um blood is certainly a\nThere they pushed very hard being so's the model of his company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush the cells strength and his weakness is that he is unlimited funds\nNow why ... limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise]\nUm well in one sense it's obviously is up but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have a limited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point SpaceX is racing ahead of him so this is the you know ... the hair\nUm blue origin the tortoise\nAnd ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also want a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA for the military base just doing it all with his own money okay\nThese shows you know is the richest man in the world ah\nAnd he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon stocky cheers sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds\nMusk knows that I'm\nYou know in aerospace a cost just people times time uh the quicker you just do something the cheaper cause people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no it would cost much less\nA because you know space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still and whether it's moving\nBill that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in that's Mars what what's going on with some of these latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European book all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a [noise]\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is it's finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar and his radar that can look through the ground and see what's on the ground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water\nUh and um but it it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment um it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars has now been found\nAnd I believe that we are going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place\nI think there's an underground water table on Mars uh\nAnd um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth\nAre still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the groundwater\nIs is as it was billions of years ago and they've been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into the groundwater and it'd be they're still now then\nThat the ground penetrating radar on the American the Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found\nGlaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is I'm a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust measures right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it is as far south as thirty eight ... a a north in the northern hemisphere Mars which by the way is the same latitude to San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers in San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that's the latitude that these things are\nAnd what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get out with a shovel\nThat's exciting now some people this is strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think there's ... there there's two different versions of it one\nIs the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay\nContamination\nPeople they are friends who are not I mean that the ... because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if if\nHow do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did well for one thing their houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower there's all this stuff that they built in the past well if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and they will be fossils of it\nAnd I mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove that the life you find there was there before is like the people who say that\nDinosaur bones don't prove that they weren't dinosaurs because God could have put the dinosaur bones in the ground and and and the world could have been made in seven days in there never was a geologic past it it's all been a a trick by

space voyage in order to ah prevent the deterioration of bone and muscle that you get with um\nIs he wrote gravity for\nLong range for longs for a long time so\nYeah exactly 'cause if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth the you know ... not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store they they get somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and and and and and and you know and moving around a\nA worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that\nAnd so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and see our gravity we can but if you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition\nNo not at all liberal do anything for you\nRight and then the the the third question was electrical pulse and yeah I Know a fair amount about electrical pulse and\nI'm electric propulsion is using\nA electric or electromagnetic forces to accelerate a pre Palance to very high velocity she cared about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric thrush true that you can with a chemical foster the problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot\nAnd that means that I'm\nYour power is limited and therefore you're thrust is limited\nAnd it's a kind of like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week I'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town\nBut if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world okay you floor of the car you know in San Francisco and um\nYou know a week later going sixty miles an hour and you've reached the east coast and now you can go\nDriving around the world 'cause your car can drive over water in this case but in any case now you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great but if you're going from earth to Mars\nIt actually takes longer to get there with electric propulsion than it does with chemical bullshit if because it the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there\nOn the other hand if you going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nI pick Mars you would um be costs you know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their grandparents' generation did\nUh the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe and bars has got much more resources so many to compare Mars to the moon\nTo the choice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon the way North America compared to Greenland you know Greenland was closer to Europe Europeans got to Greenland long before they got to North America [noise]\nBut it wasn't a place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd ah so Mars is is is you know it's a much richer world but you know here's NASA and frankly it doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars well then they say well then we'll go to the moon well when I see is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then\nGet on with they go to the moon don't come off with some other thing that's a halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if we can go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to the moon now\nHow can you believe the next July will be fifty years since we went to the moon with the first time fifty years already wherever we're at the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree east of the Rockies deals with this Long Island New York any joke go ahead\nLaw but I'm Sorry they can get to go to the mall but\nA couple of questions are in deep space uh when we send out these probes\nA wood to uh uh where would you\nBe dealing with extreme heat even open space as opposed to these planets\nAnd would it be advantageous to us to kind of go to mercury though with some sort of probes in case back here we have run away a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined with CEO to increase was\nUh in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and space help us to deal with the potentially back here\nAnd also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars uh how would you profile\nTomorrow what type of person always looking for all right let me take the question is one of the time the first question\nBe hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you are a far away from the sun is called ... and uh if you're in earth orbit it kind of depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\nUm but um you\nKnow we do have a kind of I mean you ... you can get the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so\nYou kinda have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people\nOkay hold on for a second there Robert we're going to hit the brake already school by fast food you Robert ... with us we'll be back well or let them finish up ... questions there and the interesting what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will be back in the mobile our coast to

you you have looked at profiles of people and personalities who would love to go to Mars what are they like\nWell I'm well there's all sorts of people that say they want to go on to Mars uh [noise]\nUm I mean quite literally and and some are people that are\nYou might well one on a crew that's going to Mars and others not a chance that the caller asked what sort of people would I select to go to Mars um\nAnd I'll tell you it's real simple it's the same sort of people that you would like to go on a say\nA a hiking expedition with you I'm a or an exploration ah adventure of any kind um they're the people who you know\nHave a high spirits are fun to be with the ... sense of humor a you know or not you know a grouchy um and and and ... and and and you know and and the people who can laugh when things go wrong\nAnd people who you know our own one for all in all for one\nThat's all you want to take tomorrow what's going on with the your August concert you're working on\nA well we're having another conference or in August uh or actually this year it might be in September in Los Angeles [noise] um it could ah it it's probably going to be at one of the major universities in Los Angeles [noise] um and ah\nI'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or ... or is it a gateway or is it a toll booth okay you know we're going to have that one out\nUm you know we're going to have all sorts of presentations on the latest discoveries [noise] you know ... there's a Mars probe on its way it's going to land in November ... insight and it's going to find out how a geologically active Mars is so that's kind of land this November and we'll probably have [noise]\nUm I'm discoveries from it um\nThere's also a new space telescope that just got into orbit um a couple of months ago which will be reporting data discovering planets going around other stars or am I guess it will have discovered hundreds by them and you will prompt discover thousands what's done I'm\n... I'm you know a will you know since we're going to be in Los Angeles will have a scientist from Jet Propulsion lab coming over and talking about uh\nOn Mars and the plans for the next one's ah probably have space sex people talking about what they're up to I'm hoping to get flu orange and people there too so we can hear from them\nAnd maybe some from the the the small entrepreneur rocket company like vector space just got funded by Seventy million dollars to create small watches you know the we now have small satellites that can do what it used to take big satellites\nTo do and so small rockets make a lot of sense um and um\nI I myself I'm involved design of a mission to go to the moon with ground penetrating radar with for satellites each of which are the size of a ... ... um and so little launchers like this could really play a role I'm\nAll right let's take a few more calls for you was the first time caller Armand in a bell gardens California go ahead Armand\nIs good evening George did you and your guest I just wanted to put something on your radar screen so to speak and that is that you may not be aware of this but there's a whole new paradigm for water planetary water on not only earn an all or\nIf you're interested in learning more about it you can go to jail water I.

logical this operation we started to get a ... that led to pronounce it flows databases match al development when he became a geek at that than I knew we had to hire and\nYou know it it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that\nThere's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into us\nWe've done keys in Rochester New York Yankees go ahead\nYes I'd like to ask about possible early imprint teams on the brain that might explain to an extent\nWhy people see ghost like others I've seen the film of the baby ... being fed by humans with hand pumped bits made to look like the mother so when return to the wild the tricks noted key in\nOn a mother conned or are you mentioned a widower who was searching for the pumpkin and his wife appeared and then those gone I've never had any experience like that\nBut the closest I've had over in the many years I'm now sixty three I Will rub my eyes in various ways and all different kinds of\nFigures will appear before me a figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have occurred within me a different figures in all different kinds of actions some of them quite grotesque\nAnd I'm sure that those are not gross by definition but this kind of bringing us together and closing a one about imprint teens\nThat lake with a window we're uh seen his wife saying look uh uh in the back of the garage can imprint teens can people be so emotionally attached middle like a husband to his wife that\nHe would see his wife where's the rest of us would not and maybe I in my life with the things that the rest of you would not\n... yeah yeah it's\nI don't think that's a tough one to answer I I think that you know I it's a little bit with a widower they were talking about it's a little bit like he is resonating with something in the environment that's why he's saying his wife he's not saying Abraham Lincoln or whoever else\nSo it specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him you know as as we're driving down the street in our in our cars\nOthers radio signals all around us but if I turn my radio station in Ninety two point five I only pick up Ninety two point five\nBecause we're matching frequencies so with a husband and wife with with daughter and a mother they match frequencies and that's one of these sort of experience have happened as far as an imprint goes I'm if I'm understanding that the way you're you're describing a\n... there is I mean Carl young had this idea of collective unconscious\nSo were all born with these archetypes and the sort of um blueprints for how to really manage life\nUm so we're sort of imprinted um with with with these archetypes in with sort of ancestral believes that are common throughout every culture that's happening so this could be me here in Ohio or you know um\nSort of vision and stories and things like that so I think we're all imprinted I'm In a grand gesture but it could be more specific for cultures it could be more specific for families could be imprinted\nI'm with certain information so you pass that down to your family um so it could be more micro then macro when it comes to this collective archetypes that are out there so I think there is something to the imprint I I I couldn't answer your question differently but that's sort of my best guess that it\nIt does religion kind of changed your views about the these operations ghost encounters\n[noise] yeah I I think it's it it changes our views and I basically changes our perception of an experience\nSo you know you can have someone who is a devout religious person have the same experience as someone who is not the religious person might perceive that as more of um like we talked about earlier a demon or an angel\nOr I'm a of of a sign from from God are assigned from a deceased person that they love\n'em round the person who doesn't have that religious tofu it my experiences as simply you know an experience or or um a mundane thing or ambiguous stimuli so everyone's\nEveryone's past sort of influences how we perceive any sort of ... paranormal phenomenon\nUm and that's what we talked about before\nYou know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever they believe in and if they believe in earth bounce spirits everything as it already found spirit\nA so I think perception religion or they play a huge part in how we perceive a ghost encounters impaired on the phenomenon\nHave you ever witnessed an extra ... no I never witnessed that would you like to [noise] um [noise]\nAs long as it's not yours

back to the coast to coast your story along with Brendan lawsuit low in his book of course called the ghost studies and brand new we're going to go back to selling and just a moment here\nSally in North Dakota has a situation where her daughter died sadly in a car crash a but she's getting visitation Sally how often are these visitations occurring\nShe's she's not there anymore okay well I'll get your reaction to that brand and what do you think's going on\n[noise] oh that that's actually becoming more and more common um and I've heard more and more stories about this the last ten years but this this idea that\nYou know this is somehow um goes are utilizing electric electrical equipment to communicate for that's like phone hacked emails these types of things\nUm you know typically people will report they'll get hang ups from um a family members number who's been deceased for whether it's five days or five years um then they'll get text messages from them you know after their death or you know these types of things\nAnd there's a there's a book out there that I'm a fair psychologist Dr Callas Cooper rose cause telephone calls from the dead\nWhich have compasses a great he have less of a bunch of these um phenomenon that are happening and then there's the phantom menace messages but just recently came out as well which goes over this is well\nIt's hard to really know that to me I mean listen to the idea that um\nGoes sir consciousness or wherever you want to call it is utilizing electrical electrical equipment has been going on for a while so you know to to know the exact or how that's happening I'm not sure but anytime we talked about this and there was times that I anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events like she was\nYou have these types of things happening I'm so we we the only thing we can do is try to see these consistency there's similarities and then try to find the answers as best we can from the back as\nMany changes skeptics mind Brandon can you\nUh [noise] I think you could um put some some doubt and education in there about what could possibly be happening [noise] ah it's it's a challenging it's challenging because you know at this point ghosts are measurable phenomenon\nAnd the paranormal is difficult to study in a sort of a logical scientific way and this is mainly because paranormal experiences are you know there are radical their episodic\nThey're poorly documented um their random and they're not repeatable at well which is essentially as everything that the scientific method haze um for these things are tough and and isn't that kind of why most people go into its fraud or mental illness or imaginations I'm\nNot a cop out to be able to just to see the\nAh I think it's an ... yeah a cop out would be an easy answer to it\nSo this the idea is if it's ... if I'm presented with something that I don't know the answer to um rather than spend hours and hours of researching it I can just say found the person's misunderstanding or it's fried or over active imagination\nAnd then I could go on living my life in my normal views and it doesn't blow my mind at any kind of way\nSo it's an easy way to sort of give an answer to something that\nYou know which is pretty mind blowing phenomenon um but you know there's all this this stuff out there that that some people point to as evidence like pictures a BP's um but there's really no follow up after that um and then those things nowadays are easily fake\nI I think really is and and this is kind of when I tell people out in a paranormal investigator is is you got to it's about collecting data it's about sample sizes it's about being consistent and what you do and that was over how you that's how you progress or advance of field\nYou know similar questionnaires at all these people are using when they do investigations similar methods\nUm you know if sample sizes huge in academia and was skeptics as well is that you know if if you have a sample size of three hundred people that's pretty impressive if you give questionnaires if every paranormal team gave a questionnaire to somebody and they did a hundred investigations a year and there's\nYou know I don't know\nThree hundred paranormal teams out there your sample size is getting pretty big and in academia takes notice because you have a hundred thousand questionnaires that are just waiting to be analyzed and then you start getting some variable or um some similarities inconsistencies and then you have measurable phenomenon [laughter]\nSo you know it's it's hard to argue with someone who has a a close mine but if you could just push him towards a piece of research or a book or something like that and maybe they pick it up and that helps\nYou know and that goes for the opposite end to what people were just adamant believers there's there's things you can push a more towards the mental with which is to me is the best place to be\nLet's go

there right in this house is I'm In Montana where there shouldn't be civil war goes why is that\nWell I think and and I go over I have a whole chapter devoted sort of this in my book um you know to me

pretty good pretty good at keeping the the one we're going to Mars I'm\nAt this point it looks like we're going to go to Mars when I'm either SpaceX or one of us ... and we're one of its competitors takes a fair um space sex is pushing hard a following up their success with the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle with\nA developing their beer far rocket which will be fully be usable or to stage to orbit hundred and fifty tons to earth orbit vehicle that's equivalent to a Saturn five but fully reusable or that will give us the capability to go to Mars uh\nAnd if they should um you know ... off the edge of the ice 'cause you know you must likes to skate next to the edge of the ice ... um they got a the blue origin company by a led by ... base owes the owner of Amazon is a\nIs coming up on his heels so um we got a new space race going on and I think that one of the ... outfits is going to get us to Mars right now [noise]\nYou know NASA is does great work with its robotic climate training missions and its base astronomy missions they work in that field is epic bought the human spaceflight program is dysfunction\nNot even planning a reasonable plan to do that and um so I think it's gonna be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy the privatization is taking off the way it is and that NASA is kind of like fading away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA's human spaceflight program as dysfunctional ah I'm not happy about that at all um the uh you know I ... it would be disastrous NASA's robotic\nSpace flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program that I mean that storm have it in the Nineteen sixties doing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago where a high level NASA official got actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said\nWe're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThe moon [laughter] what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got and maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember that to die off so they can help people they did it the first time\nAnd that's been alone Robert will make all the people who dealt that we went to the moon jumper and joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood\nUm and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station in orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it's and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is gonna be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission I mean ... let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay\n[laughter] the the the ...\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal\nI Want to bring you an office in Saskatoon now you're going to have to pay to build the building and you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill to pass on that\nHad the whole and this thing\nIs that I buy the swamp line you'd probably sell me\nWhat you buy the swarm play and you'd probably want to sell me a lot\nBetter off with the swamp land then went this\nJeeze [laughter] well you wouldn't be ISIL is doing what he's doing fell ... sex are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching nests are just kind of an not do much anymore with manned space flights and it's it's just a poignant Robert it really is\nIt is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and that government built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\n... and ... and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible\nUm I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects on it and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nA chaos and the the the you know so\nAnd that the new nasty administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while\nWould come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who preceded us uh you know wanting to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the mood I was hoping Brian and Stein would do that but he didn't he just went along\nAnd I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flight of one of the falcons a at night and then it came back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the guys that night\nUh the they didn't know what it was they thought it was a you off or something like that but it was spectacular to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time uh because sure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get him to be reusable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that mosque is done and creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduced the cost the space launch by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram before must now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram traumatic\nIt's dramatic it's protect killer and it was done on a shoestring compared to [noise] um what\nA NASA considers normal for developing new space systems\nI mean it was done like from one tenth the money in one third of the time\nThat any one of ... was accepting would be normal and this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding it is causing a private money to get into space\nAnd a number of other advanced fields that people thought were helpless uh so okay Bezos has his own money he's got blue origin but we now have three small launch companies a firefly\nA vector space um\nElectron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars a two to field a small launch systems\nAnd it even goes beyond the the us space industry we now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded because people you know they were looking at fusion parents all this is just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and this is another Twenty years\nAnd but people than say maybe it's not really\nAn impossible technical problem maybe the ...\nAnd um I gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around the table and he sent all of us\nYou know when fusion power spine and develop it's not going to be in a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage sale well\nMaybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably a start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what is going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next dollar will take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours lacks the coast to coast\nAlways on your bones and you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized removed users and just point your iPhone or Android rose or to goes to goes them die\n\nUh okay look um the thing to know about Iran is is this okay on the one side he well he he is very driven it's very hard working uh uh and he is a\nDriven to want to do something great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages [laughter] he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he was about uh\nNow he he he really wants to do he he wants to go down in the history books for doing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that\nHe doesn't just want to do great deeds he wants eternal gory for doing great teeth so he's not Mother Teresa can be selfish and\nHe he and he certainly um\nNot above using people are and you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well like getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand\nOh yeah uh the the you know there is [noise] um\n... you know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing ... the two of the eagle about\nThat it's not exactly ego it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the ... had\nThis is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal blurry for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth you know uh\nWhen it gets that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core to to fight the French because he he even though I mean the odds of more against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone so you know that's mosque to AT T and um\nAnd and and so but really um\n[noise] you know that that's the classical motives with a hero okay so I I think mosque is a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant who goes out a ... you looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh that that's what he's about but you know um\nHow would you come from the Jeff ... Robert Well Jeff Bezos is much calmer a much more laid back um\nI don't know these cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh\nAnd if you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect at a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday and um\nThe company takes chances and thus far um they're winning um blood is certainly a\nThere they pushed very hard being sells the model of his company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush the cells strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why ... limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise]\nUm well in one sense it's obviously is a but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space X is racing ahead of him so this is the you know ... the hair\nUm blue origin the tortoise\nAnd ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as richest mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also want a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA effort the military\nThings those just doing it all with his own money okay these shows you know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon stocky cheers sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks\nKnows that I'm\nYou know in aerospace a cost just people times time uh the quicker you just do something the cheaper cause people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no it would cost much less\nUh because uh you know space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still on whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in that Mars what what's going on with some of these latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European all these experiments or ex\nDiscoveries by the way are being made now with a\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar than his radar that can look through the ground and see what's underground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water [noise]\nUh and um but it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment um it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars it has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place\nI think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth\nAre still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water is is as it was billions of years ago and they been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into the groundwater and it'd be they're still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American the Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found\nGlaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is I'm a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust knows it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight ... a a north and the northern hemisphere Mars which by the way the same latitude to San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers in San Francisco and Denver and you know [noise] Washington DC you know that's the the latitude that these things are\nAnd what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get out with a shovel\nThat's exciting now some people this is strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think there's ... there's two different versions of it one\nIs the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay\nContamination yeah well that's\nThey are friends who are not I mean ... because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if if\nHow do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did well for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower there's all this stuff that they built in the past well if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and they will be fossils of it\nAnd I mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove that the life you find there was there before is like the people who say that\nDinosaur bones don't prove that they weren't dinosaurs because God could have put the dinosaur bones in the ground and and and the world could have been made in seven days and there never was a

go on\nOh probably take them off the air [noise] there's sort of speculative\nFirst is um you know anything about Mr leader that go there and we were just talking about anti gravity in the sixties and Congress we\nYou know anything about a couple reversal of being able to generate order for ... and certainly you know anything about electrical record ...\nLet me ask those questions but he's got one more Robert one more okay one more\nLike a third one is ... ... ... ... to design a space station like a memorial type thing\nTo I'm a human physiology reacts to Mars gravity\nAll right Robert let's take that one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just to run 'em down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one Learjet and anti gravity I don't know anything about that\nSecond question artificial gravity um which goes along with your last question of a spinning space craft yeah we do know how to create artificial gravity you spend the space craft\nCrates and cheer physical force that mixed gravity and that's a uh in my view a a a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to ah prevent the deterioration of bone and muscle that you get with um [noise] as he wrote gravity\nFor long range for longs for a long time so\nYeah exactly 'cause if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth the you know not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store they they get somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and and and and and and you know and moving around a\nA worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that\nAnd so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and see our gravity we can but if you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition\nNo not at all liberal burial or do anything for you\nRight and then the the the third question was electrical pulse and yeah I Know a fair amount of Appalachia Paulson\nUm electric propulsion is using\nA electric or electromagnetic forces to accelerate upper pounds to very high velocity she'd get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric roster that you can with the chemical foster the problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot\nAnd that means that I'm\nYour power is limited and therefore you're thrust is\nOlson systems are kind of like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week I'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town\nBut if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world okay you floor of the car you know in San Francisco and\nUm you know a week later going sixty miles an hour and you've reached\nA the east coast and now you can go driving around the world 'cause your car and drive over water in this case but in any case now you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great but if you're going from earth to Mars\nIt actually takes longer to get there with electric propulsion than it does with chemical bullshit\nIf because the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there\nOn the other hand if you going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nI picked Mars you would um be costs you know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their grandparents' generation did\nUh the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe and bars has got much more resources so many to compare Mars to the moon\nTo the choice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon the way North America compared to Greenland you know Greenland was closer to Europe Europeans got to Greenland long before they got to North America [noise]\nBut it wasn't the place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd ah so Mars is is is you know it's a much richer world\nBut you know here's NASA and frankly it doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars well then they say well then we'll go to the moon well when I say he is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then get on with the go to the moon don't come off with\nSome other thing that's a halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if we can go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to the moon now\nHow can you believe that next July will be fifty years since we went to the moon with the first time fifty years already rubber word the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree east of the Rockies deals with this Long Island New York age oh go ahead\nLaw that I'm Sorry they can get to go to the mall but a couple of questions are in deep space uh when we send out these probes\nAre what you are or where\nWould you be dealing with extreme heat even\nSpace as opposed to these planets\nAnd would it be advantageous to us to kind of go to mercury though with some sort of probes in case back here we have run away a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined with CEO to increase was\nUh in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and space help us to deal with the potentially back here and also what kind of person would profile ah going to Mars uh how\nOn a ship to Mars or type approach somebody looking for all right let me take the question is when the time of the first question it the hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you are a far away from the sun it's called uh and uh [noise]\nIf you're in earth orbit climate depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\nUm but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can you can get the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so\nYou kinda have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it and you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people\nOkay hold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit the brake already school by fast with the Robert ... with us we'll be back well or let them finish up ... questions there and a ... interesting what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will be back in the mobile our coast to coast are you\nFeeling lost not by your radio grab your smartphone or a computer and listen to I heard radio pick up the pre ... hard radio ... store or go to our heart radio dot com\n\nTo celebrate we're sending free bottles to men who want to cut down on bathroom trips yes your first thirty

say the key word free bottle again dial pound to five zero and say the key word free bottle\n[noise]\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast our final segment with Robert Zubrin here from the marsh and study Robert ... by the way are linked up it goes to goes damn dot com bust Robert you you have looked at profiles of people and personalities who would love to go to Mars what are they like\n[noise] well um well there's all sorts of people that say they want to go to Mars uh [noise] um I mean quite literally and and some are people that are you might well want on a crew a that's going to Mars and others not a chance\nThat the caller asked what sort of people would I select to go to Mars um\nAnd I'll tell you it's real simple it's the same sort of people that you would like to go on a say\nA a hiking expedition with you I'm a or an exploration ah adventure of any kind um they're the people who you know\nHave a high spirits are fun to be with the sense of humor a you know or not you know a ... um and and and ... and and and you know and and the people who can laugh when things go wrong\nAnd people who you know our own one for all in all for one\nThat's all you want to take tomorrow what's going on with the your August concerts you're working on\nA well we're having another conference a in August uh or actually this year it might be in September in Los Angeles [noise] um it could ah it it's probably going to be at one of the major universities in Los Angeles [noise] um and ah\nI'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or is it a gateway or is it a toll booth okay you know we're going to have that one out\nUm you know we're going to have all sorts of presentations on the latest discoveries you know ... there's a Mars probe on its way it's going to land in November of insight and it's going to find out how a geologically active Mars is so that's kind of land this November and we'll probably have [noise]\nUm [noise] discoveries from it um [noise]\nThere's also a new space telescope that just got into orbit um a couple of months ago which will be reporting data discovering planets going around other stars or am I guess it will have discovered hundreds by them it it will prompt discover thousands or it's done I'm ...\nI'm you know a will you know since we're going to be in Los Angeles will have a scientist from Jet Propulsion lab coming over and [noise]\nAll the latest discoveries from the rovers on Mars and the plans for the next one's ah probably have space sex people talking about what they're up to I'm hoping to get flu orange and people there too so we can hear from them\nAnd maybe some from the the the small entrepreneur rocket companies like vector space just got funded by Seventy million dollars to create small watches you know\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAh I myself I'm involved in design of a mission to go to the moon with ground penetrating radar with for satellites each of which are the size of ... um and so little launchers like this could really play a role I'm\nAll right let's take a few more calls for you in school the first time caller Armand in a bill gardens California go ahead Armand\nIs good evening George could you and your guest I just wanted to put something on your radar screen so to speak and that is that you may not be aware of this but there's a whole new paradigm for water planetary water on not only earth but on march\nIf you're interested in learning more about it you can go to jail water I. M. P. L. dot com like international your water international and the reality is that it's already been well demonstrated on this planet\nBut the water comes from them back ... below and whatever you've got the ... the planet fractured\nThat water that hydrogen and oxygen and elemental hundreds and option can make its way to the surface and in fact\nIn areas of the ... the structure that happens quite often and on Mars the same effect is there in fact the largest volcano in the solar system is Olympus moms are bars which is over eighty thousand feet tall just for the ages there was a cold beer or on top\nAnd that's what brought her to provide Scott city or lava flows to happen\nSo that's really where the water has always been on Mars and that's where the water is on this planet and it's time I think for us to start factoring that is true our calculations for a Mars trip\nWell said rubber what do you think\nWell I I it sounds interesting we certainly know there's a lot of water on Mars we found the lakes we found glaciers in this probably more to find so I think he's on the right track\nDo you think we are the Martians that a long time ago either\nOrganisms flew here from it'll chopped up media writes a slow off the planet or or maybe they had a full blown civilization long time ago and the ... I think\nI think the former is is this a good chance is true\nAh in not civilizations but a microbes on on meteors a because Mars um well a couple things first of all life appeared on earth almost immediately after it could\nWhich either means one or two things that life can evolve very quickly from chemistry or that life was floating around in space and as soon as the earth was cool enough\nFor life to to prosper here they ate it landed in the seeds to cold as it were\nUm and now if you think about that when you say here's Mars nearby it's being hit find meteors knocking chunks off sending them flying and hitting the earth we're hit\nIf life could evolve quickly out of chemistry it would have on Mars Mars coup before earth to Mars had liquid water before interested so life is is is a quick study evolving rapidly from chemistry it would've occurred on Mars first and then it would have landed here\nSo there is a good chance that keen for Mars the the the the a and also that is supported by the fact that we find no organisms on earth no free living organisms simpler than bacteria and bacteria are really pretty complicated they have this whole\nTruth DNA in are in a whole alphabet for transmitting genetic information [noise]\nUm you know a imagined you you've found a um an ancient manuscript that\nI had a complete alphabet along with all the punctuation marks and everything and [noise] ah it could not possibly be the first written document that they would have to be more primitive things before\nYou know the complete alphabet and punctuation and comments and paragraphs and all this had been worked out so uh but bacteria have all that so that suggests that the team here already fully developed it could've come from Mars or maybe both earth and Mars in interstellar space\nI just lost his how did you get interested in all this Robert\nSputnik that did it for you\nYeah well I was already somewhat interested I I was an early reader I was five when Sputnik flu and while to the adult world split it may have been a terrifying event to me it was just great ah because what it was proving was that the um\nThe space faring uh stories that I was reading we're going to be true\nAnd I can remember reading about uh like it the space dog in my weekly reader\nAnd later ah I'm ... and ... the next space dogs and you know I'm I have a dog today her name is ... and the the struggle was the first dog to come back from space alive and she even had puppies and Khrushchev gave one to Jackie Kennedy\nAnd um and her descendants are alive today\nUm anyway so um\nI remember the public school I was a little kid that but I also remember how my parents were horrified over Sputnik was a little tiny thing the size of a basketball and you know Americans were just panicking how come", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Coosada", "day": "23"}
