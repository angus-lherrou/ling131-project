... piece Electra chronic voice phenomena where the whole chapter in a book about\nPatterson perfect because it seems to me that since we've gone to the digital age from the analog age they're getting more and more these recordings\n[noise] yes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to\nUse digital radio to scan the frequencies more quickly a fellow by the name of Frank some action in the nineties figured out that if you go back\nA digital FM radio you can literally break it in such a way so that is that's scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station when the signal comes and clear it just continually sweeps ... and again that\nThat's that continuous sweeping has ... ... ... if you do that voices and other sounds sort of a rise out of that noise and again people will write these words down that they will capture in these very quick\nSparse moment says it scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with a with a imagine as the spirit world\nHe came up with one is called springs box which is ... ... exactly that isn't it [noise]\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um ... devices that he made and he\nWill eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but that was he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nOr as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything strange yourself\nWell I did some experiments and there were a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think was important was that I was able to sort of get into that had space where I felt that I was doing something that had been\nBeing done for centuries I mean I'm I'm I Would like to make the argument that even somebody like John ... who is using his themes stones to try to communicate with the angels in it and as a result created what magicians called the ... language\n... at that use of a scene stone is the same as using a radio to communicate with the spirit world that that this is something that human beings had been attempting to do with some\nMedium mystic device some material device where we take something and we we purpose that we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended and in fact the magician or the medium becomes I kind of spiritual hacker\nWhere we're really trying to interact with\nOur technologies and our material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know what's really the hackers that have more early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers we probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home [laughter]\nThat's true Peter ... with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book with Jewish mythology and legend surrounding the Golan tell us about that\nYeah I mean I like to think that the goal of them is really the first piece of technology right where we try to build something in an interview with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the gold them as it's called particularly the colon uh Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel um who are being attacked\nOr there's a poll rum and they're trying to defend themselves up\nAnd eventually the goal and become as it goes you know it it it it it there's chaos ensues the rabbi can no longer control it and either has to destroy it already has to put it to sleep\nIn one of the stories that goal and grows so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder and a race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles and ... sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories but if you look at the actual\nJewish ... ... missed this as a mystical writings about the goal of them the goal of them is in some ways a\nA means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their\nSpiritual ... it's it's almost like a task to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge but the goal in itself is was understood by the rabbis debate just kind of a dumb machine there's a wonderful tell my story where\nA rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal among the he says to them well what can I Do kind of speak and they say well no uh can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just a ... it's just the toy [noise]\nWhich is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures right right so we can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretend there's to the throne as it were\nWhat about the Sherman says well you know in Native American tradition and other types of was a good cultures\nThat to to the other side [noise]\nRight and the Sherman would also use utilize\nSound and light off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to win due to the states have consciousness in their people and I think that what the ... does and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also [noise]\nConnect south and connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging of spiritualism which spirit cabinet tend to different ways in which\nPeople were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet or ... but they were using technology used to be able to create a state\nConsciousness in the audience and so I don't think that it's necessarily when we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to being chanted we want to invest in that state of mind [noise]\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advanced ...\nI think is something that we belong\nAnd excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a showman is that your experience as\nA Thomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build a ... machine I don't think he was never able to do it was\nYou know and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have very interesting thing here where we have people who are considered scientists rationalize\nAnd it's not that they were the bunk in because they wanted to just be cynical are skeptical because they really want that there to be the truth this is true of Houdini Houdini really wanted him he really wanted to find a medium\nWho could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his ear departed mother but he couldn't find on all he found or Charlotte but his but he believed that it could be possible and I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment for ten even if it's just a pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves into\nThose either Houdini by the way we read your writing was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right because it's going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy but to you as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had today's equipment do you think he might be able to do something\n[laughter] navy but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes founded that people are using these things but if you sort of [noise]\nYou know move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraptions ... trying to hide the fact that maybe he really was it is magical as you thought you\nWere going to be back in a moment to talk more with Peter a beeper goal his book strange frequencies we've got a link to his publisher Random House to make it easy for you to get the book if you're into this is a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nFor the super natural stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour we'll leave and take your stories you're paranormal stories and just your general questions more to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology in its ability to maybe\nSince senators the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available gripe bone and know Android poured out on a boat\nListen Leiber on demand anywhere any time\nGo to goes to goes to um dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\n\nEra troll ... material death that I mean it it I think it's actually a very American Spirit right I mean there are some scholars a sociologist one in particular max vapor used to talk about you know Protestantism in the area of capitalism that\nHave been about a Protestant American there it is something whereby we want to\nProve our right now as we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right\nAnd I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we are in charge of our own salvation where we want to be right in front of\nOur experience with the divine is is again something that's very human I think particularly American off and\nAnd so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with aerial with God or the ...\nHow do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something the pre existing opening it up and re purpose in it\nAnd so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people have practiced magic for millennium right it's just another example of magic of a of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between\nRight right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool\nAnd I could we put you Peter in that category [noise]\nMyself yeah well I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that um I tend to uh believe though that\nWe have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from it we have to post put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer them maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\nTo yeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean there is\nA ... you know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are\nLike this goes you know back to the whole idea that we once used to think that a bit a profit was somebody who had special information for us and now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so\nYou know it's a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and [noise]\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual aren't are often considered outsider artists why is that why are the people who are working\nWith these themes consider to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular aren't you know mainstream artistic community and I think it's\nWe live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience and what's interesting about technology or is it is and this is really key here to see if I can explain this somebody takes her radio\nAnd they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio when I'm when a resort or a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world\nBut the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to the Saudi Arabia and have another effect hate place\nThe science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find a store which said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't against and yet we can take the things this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that\nIs underneath it scientific method in scientific understanding of the world it's\nWhat's underneath it and divorced and turned it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can think about technologies in ways that that the science connected to them might actually be in opposition to\nWell you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen on line and somebody came up to you and said Peter ... are you voices of this guy\nAnd all these strange things he's out there he's out there and you of course who knew never had a radio you never went online like that to listen you're probably saying what's this guy talking about he's insane\nOr but my voices out there and it's being heard by millions or if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to is the right kind of receiver [noise]\nWell it's fascinating that you say that because when\nSpiritual is an was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started develop had telegraph technology\nAnd people called medium spiritual mediums spiritual telegraph [laughter] they really believe that there was this link between this\nThis new version and technology and how you're right it was a special and new hind receiver and transmit her and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq has really augmented in shape things were spirituality and technology tell me why\nI well I mean the TV itself is kind of a ... very strange and scary oh yeah the the there is a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four\nCalled the blue television company and they actually they this is how they advertise their television is is what they said\nThe dreams of witches have come true oh my God [laughter] so they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird\nBut to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether ripe\nUm and so the the fact that you know week that we used to call those the after effects on TV you know and then when we were used to watch ... VHS stations with an antenna\nWe used to call those ghosts right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically is is filled to the brim right with these supernatural on a called metaphors and I think that that's really important I think even when we talk about technology for not believers and even if we're just\nUsing it we still use these this language to try to make sense of it\nThen I remember those days to dump that this has anything to do with our discussion tonight but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those [noise]\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely [noise] yup\nMy dad had an old field goal radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was and it was in case in this beautiful piece of wood furniture\nAnd had silicone written across it uh it ... it was it was a piece of art in the same way or the TVs in the in the stereotypes that they started coming out with\nThe Chinese are meant to be central pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like poultry guys comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nHow are you a hundred percent ... Peter that the other side exists [noise]\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live in a very limited all place what I what I like\nKnowledge is that I really believe that these ambiguous states are and chanting steak when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical than somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and tell me what you think things will be like a fifty years from now with regards to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well ... let's talk more about um maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but we will have transcended to the other side by use of artificial intelligence uploading our consciousness to computers\nThere's a movement of what's called trans humanism and hosts humanists\nWho believe that we will become so merged with technology that we will become the new spirit world that it's going to be our consciousness inhabiting this electronic digital realm [noise] um so I'm I'm more convinced that it's going to be\nA repair for the details are marketing plan called the good some group at five five blonde zero two to five\nOr email me directly a bogus and charter dot net\nThat's five five one zero to from\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control centers this is W.

didn't reach Harry Houdini\nIt busted a trail that bacteria comes out and just ran through his body\nRight and they had no anti bacterial anything back then in twenty six so he uh had took him seven days to die\nWho had won the substances that what happened yes yeah I was a\n... so its ups assault through they had two operations\nAnd then they gave him some mysterious serum that they'd been working on but nothing seemed to work\nDuring those seven days he had time to go over this afterlife experiment she invested worked out and they'd had it since the early Nineteen hundreds\nOr since before Nineteen Thirteen they had this it's a two way code that they'd worked out if one of them died that they would use this code\nContact each other and so he had a week it took him a week to pass away he was so strong and so they had a week together to fine tune this code and then about two years later she gets the actual code from Arthur forward\nNow how does Arthur forget the code what are the you know a a medium trans what happens\nIf aren't there Ford was a ... medium he wasn't like I'm a Marjory I'm you know the er which for life than\nYou can like she's like was he was he liked

going to know that you're there but\nHoudini was sharper than Houdini said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code\nThat she's the one who gets [noise]\nRight I Want to make its shirts her so she has five words in French that she'd give back the comeback to him oh so this was an ingenious code really because it's taking the Penn it's like Fifteen words wrong\nWhy why was Harry professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually forty even let everybody know what was going on\nAs well as you know Harry had to be first\nFirst hand to escape\nRight here with us as a policy just he had to be first I don't know if you know that Harry when the first guy to fly an airplane in Australia\nYes he was that's true I heard\nHe had to be first in a matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game about that\nSo uh and he did several movies he he was a really multi talented guy [noise] um I think he would have been I think he would have had a movie um career mogul yeah how do you survive he invented what they call now the dailies\nUh in in the movie industry he invented that\nRussia cuts right\nYes so he was a you know awesome\nAnd all these different ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grave to do if he was going to do he was going to do that\nAny new thinking was successful\nI I Know what successful I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon didn't know that for a fact didn't\nComfort professor Bess his wife the\nBest was in tough shape best was pretty depressed but ... ... you know her husband had died and bass was um she had developed some [noise]\nWhat I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy [laughter] and she uh\nWhile he was alive and ask died\nWhile he was alive and after he died\nAnd so\nIf you remember Nineteen twenty nine when the message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her magic friends really wanted to believe that in any way and then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses not only all her friends she loses all\nHer money she was arrested in the stock market yes she loses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's\nGot this bad habit of spending money like a girls on trees just\nAnd I guess hearing left her nice little sum\nHe left her a part of the uh [noise]\nThey paid double\n... or whatever for his ah insurance insurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in Nineteen thirty six is probably a lot of money that you\nWrite ... probably that's close to a million dollars [laughter] um so [noise]\nThey doubled that because they said it was an accident because this guy punched him mhm and so it was the insurance company that came up and said ah that can't happen\nAnd so they were proven wrong in court so she got a thousand so she was rolling and do you know and then she they put it all in the market and she lost at all\nNow you have heard of the curse that killed Houdini yes what is the curse\n[noise] know Houdini had a three part ... show first part of the show was magic mhm the second part was skipped college years you know keep would do an escape\nThat was where the water or Chinese water torture cell or the uh the milk can skate and then the last part towards the end of his career\nHe would go after the spiritual life and he would have had this um a confrontation with them bunch ups in self like confrontation right [noise] well at some point in time\nHe would say I've had enough and he would get up during a third party he would go out to a palm reader or somebody or a\nA that he considered fake and you go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be following them any going they need to find a couch or something and they pull out like an incandescent down that goes in the dark or sometimes the I found it I got to you know and\nAnd they're probably a dance string or something like that\nRight so uh and of course the the medium to just what a what do you do that I didn't have nothing to do that\nWell they honestly didn't because I I'm a magician and a magician always have what you call in out there's always a way out\nYou work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick you might have two or three different methods on how it works and there's something else he switched to the next one and you switch to the next one and and at work\nSo you're assured of success\nAnd so in his magic that's built in in his tapes of course I'm I guarantee you got two or three keys in there\nYou know and if all rat failed and he couldn't get the T that's would come out and kiss him and she got the appropriate tea in her mouth\nAnd just put it into his mouth\nExactly auto he always had an out he always had a way out well for exactly the same thing for the spiritual spiritual is because he had an agent and she would go into town and\nShe would find some or all hanging fruit you would find some a medium that were obviously tricking people\nBut some she couldn't find what they're doing ranch couldn't catch them so she would pull out something from beneath her clothes and like stuff it into the couch\nAnd so later Houdini had a sure thing that he could come back and expose them even though they didn't know anything about it\nIt seems that somebody somewhere puts a curse on it\nRight so he did this with Marjorie he Marjorie was the uh the which from Boston\nHold on for ... seconds a professor we're we're in a break but we'll come right back and talk about the person that can\nDo for you to watch a TV show beyond belief you know just log onto beyond belief dot com ...\nCheese\n\nOr\n[noise]\nLines ...

E. R. dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n\nOkay welcome back to coast to coast professor slim king with us as we talk about the life of Harry Houdini we'll also talk about magic very shortly as well professor back to the curse you were talking about the Marjorie and Houdini and explain a little bit more about who Marjorie was\nOK I'm Marjory I'm Nina Korean and she was a socialite in Boston she was married to a doctor\nAnd they kind of mysterious life she was to be really really a sensuous ... lady\nUh all the pictures I see she looks pretty average but everybody met her I thought she was just devastatingly beautiful I don't know why they did and it had probably had something to do with the way that she did say on a minute when they called her\nFor the blonde which of Boston and complement in those days to call somebody a which\nI think so I think it's [laughter]\nI think they uh they got a big kick out of it because I was a lot of people during that time period during the spiritual is movement\nHum a lot of people were having families circles\nThey were all kinds of people who were Catholics are Baptists or whenever I'm there on a Sunday afternoon or a Saturday they weren't all get together in the middle of the day and hold hands and somebody would go into a trance and they would try to contact their the feast relatives it was a common back in the twenties\nOkay but this this curse now right so ah he\nGoes and then he's going to check out I mean a ... and he's going to go to Boston and they line up about six say on says that he's going to attend now the Scientific American has a twenty five hundred dollar per se for anybody that can prove that\nThey are a real medium earning her normal and a kind of like the GRE up the change Randy educational foundation had a million dollar one here which they never had to give out right they never had to give it out but they I don't think they actually let anybody who could actually win participate\n[laughter] I'm like you for that one\nYeah uh well they can they can deflect me all they want I don't think they played fair and they finally shut it down and then just giving them money whoever they want that is interesting that they were taking in about one point five million dollars a year talking about a million dollar contest so they were coming out way ahead\nSo anyway the uh the Scientific American has the same kind of thing going on so they're always going to Marjory thing on says so they set this up with six of these and Houdini goes up but he doesn't send\n'em ruins Mac and ... that's the agents that easily center head what he does he builds a box kind of looks like a son he builds his box and then he has um James Collins build it for him\nAnd he builds all of a Houdini props and it's it's designed so that only mean his head and our hands can stick out\nOkay so she can't get anything so Houdini is going to make sure that she can't\nProduce any trickery so they uh do one ... and everything goes according to plan and uh they have what they call a ballot box it's a little a bell inside of a box\nAnd if they push on the uh the bell rang and they always put the box outside of the reach of me now\nAh and in this particular instance they put it between Houdini slack [noise]\nSo there's no way anyone could get out well in the first thing on the ... the bell rings so the second thing on he brings in the box and he puts her in the box he's going to stop\nIt right and they put it that and the second ... the bell rings a bell\nNow he's got a picture and liberal we talked about before about there's always an out you have to he has to fix marching Marjorie because he's actually already written a book about her\nHow he's you know exposed her yeah so he's got this book he's going to put out so you have to expose her so she comes in\nUh everybody gets around the fans and of course Marjorie\nHas a spirit guide ... his name is Walter Marjorie brother so Walter she goes into a trance and Walter ...\nThe cursing at Houdini and he says why did you put this foul thing in here why are you doing this why did you do this I'm cursing you\nAnd this is every new scissors and this was his appearance saying this right\nThis is the spirit saying it through Marjorie and the spirit Walter puts a death occurs because\nInside the box is a rule or one of those rulers pulls up into three pieces and one of those kinds of this and it's in side the box the only people that had access to the box was Houdini wild and a James Collins\nHouse was the curse a professor and then who do you ended up dying\n[laughter] well the ... he cursed them and some people say that he said you'll die in a year and that's a you know people debate about that\nBut he died in two years he was totally dead this big strong man died in two years after being cursed by Walter does it scare you [noise] [noise] well actually Houdini used it in his advertising you can see their Houdini ads all over the place\nWhere Houdini advertise that he's under the curse of the spiritual and could die at any moment yeah and really helped him you know kind of in a way but then you get this concept of the self fulfilling prophecy\nRight that they have a pop fly that he's gonna die so later when Houdini gets\nSick or maybe this is in the back of his mind and so he doesn't go to the doctor\n'cause he doesn't want to he doesn't want to prove them right he doesn't want to show that he's getting sick or something is happening and that kind of my viewpoint of maybe what happened why he didn't go when he first started getting sick\nAnd Arthur for what happened to him was actually\nArthur Ford Arthur forward toward the world after he gave this or did he live Houdini he outlive all uh she lived until Seventy one oh wow okay or poured lived on a fantastic life um\nSo after a Houdini tries to frame up Marjory\nI'm he puts out this book he actually fails but he says he does it and he's got these\nPhotos of Marjory legs under the table and then he had some drawings made where her leg is reaching around his leg so he makes some drawings and puts them in the book where the photo is not anything like that drawing a\nTrickery by Houdini\nYes sir Houdini once again is doing this and um there was a guy named attribute Gibson and he is probably one of if not the number one a expert on Houdini he worked with Houdini he worked with down injure and then he worked with crafts can\nAnd he makes a statement that there's a a a bombshell in in the interview craft can\nAnd he gives this quote by Gibson says when all magicians realize that Houdini was often just honest as the mediums he purported to expose wow that's pretty heavy that is heavy coming from the number one guy\nSo he knew that they were putting 'em your genes cones in there and that uh\nThe rose Mac and ... was going ahead and and they were setting them up so he would have a great show the three parts show\nCan you imagine what Houdini would have done professor if they had television in those days\nA boy\nIt was kind of a brings up another a subject you know I'm On the on and you wonder why people don't put the I'm fine with TV really [noise] well I was involved in a\nWhile they have the dark and it's so much you won't see anything\nRight well we'll talk about that little leader because these Sanford is the ones I'm

cells or a there was one tiny escape from a like big fish they built the big fish 'cause there was a fish company that was sponsoring him in their town [laughter] so he would ah\nIt would kind of ingenuity fleas he would make up some way to escape from something that tight in his advertisers\nTony Curtis died in a twenty two and he was eighty five years old but I thought he did a great job in that Harry Houdini movie you remember it\nYeah yeah I think all of the movies had been actually pretty good yeah ah I don't they don't stick with the actual\nHoliday is how did he make that elephant disappear in the hip ... in London how did he do that\nWell can you want me to tell yeah\nYeah you know the ... [laughter] I mean what did he how did they have the thing covered or or what first of all\nA ... I Can't I'm not going to come on\nCome on now I might\nTell you in private there's a book you can buy a ... by a guy who who\nHill and let me ask you this if I'm right would you tell me\nThat if I if you want to write all I'll tell you do I have to tell you on air\n... well maybe I'm just going to ask you a few questions okay that's all did he have any apparatus that raises the elephant from underground you\nKnow he did not okay I'm going to assume that the elephant was always there\n[noise] [noise]\nOkay we'll do a little more homework ask yeah there you go now who comes up with the tricks I mean was it Houdini does that make him a genius for being able to come up with this or did he have somebody on staff like you who would say here's this trek\nAnd let's do this and we can make this and that how did they do this is Sam what's called the puck Copperfield to I assume ... people on staff like you right\nExactly exactly um [noise] James Collins when the guy that Houdini built all informed Houdini would say I want to do this and then he would put it in the ball in their court and then they would have come up with how you would\nDo so I assume in the HIPAA Jerome they walked in Allison out everybody sees this thing lumbering in and and then they shrouded in or close to or something and then the trick began a ... it's absolutely amazing wasn't the queen there at the time\n[noise] uh well he probably the same lean that's there and [laughter] you know you're up but I don't think she was there [noise]\nOkay I I don't know for sure next on it I don't\nThink she was there I think he performed for them in Europe\nLet's go to the first time caller Ralph in Indianapolis ... go ahead\nI'm here already taken away readings\nAnd his allies got a letter from him just before he died of seeing bishop pike on a ledge when he was trying to go over to comb Ron in Israel and that's where they found him\nA question for you is what we what year did Arthur forward bring back the code to Mrs Houdini this was in Nineteen twenty nine\nOkay and it was a three part code or the code was the middle section first word was Rosenthal arose and then he had a code for the nine or words that spelled out believe\nAnd then she had dry words in French which means I pulled the curtain back like this and that's what she told him so he was assured that his code I'd gotten through now didn't he she later denied that\nLater on a after she loses her friends she loses all her money a man called Edward Said comes into her life and says he's er manager but they live together\nAnd he fell in love again yeah so he didn't like that and that's why he wanted to come back\nRight she meet women the same kind of way that doesn't mean that to me there's a lot of things going on here but he's like Twenty years younger than her ... her that she can make a movie and she'll make a million dollars okay go ahead\nA one year than they cheat deny that to the code was correct\nWell the first time she never denies the code was correct\nUh she says she was pool but she never denies that the code was correct but she first about a year and a half after um she they're given the Houdini messages\nShe's having lunch with some ladies in Miami and she she said she was hesitant about a\nHoudini coming back because why didn't he fever from the depression so she was she thought that Houdini would somehow saber from this math\nDepression that what's happening or that somehow he was going to come back and now breakfast with her every morning or something I don't know what she was thinking but she wasn't happy about the fact that\nA ... report was on tour somewhere so she had no way to contact him and so she was you know showing your pleasure for that then Edward St comes in leader promises or a million dollars and then they go on and about eight years later they make a movie called a\nA religious racket tears\nYou know he made them or a couple of movies at least Disney\n... well Houdini made four or five movies\nYeah but they also I Hope they do they do well\nThey did fine but he was he was the star of every movie\nWas he like an actor or are they more like documentaries\nThey he was an actor and he always had like a really really good looking coast are\nHis real name Eric Weiss yes he was he was a pretty good looking guy to\nA kind of a ... guy he was only and everything kind of a smooth smooth talker could really give a a ... compliments really well but he wasn't the greatest actor but he used it to promote his escape so we had a bunch of escapes in there all the movies\nReal name Eric white some\nHank yes and that's Eric turned into Harry and then Houdini he got from who Don and he had it and I called in Houdini and er so to this day and they call them Harry Houdini but I don't think he ever\nA switch his name and he was born\nWell yeah he was born in Hungary he was on an angry Budapest and he wasn't even actually\nA U.S citizen or if you think\nWasn't there magician named Blackstone or did he come after Harry\nA block so it was after here yeah\nOkay I guess he was pretty good too wasn't he\nHe was great he was great or there was also the junior\nHas has a techno who's who's the artist who are David Blaine is humid you should do\nWell he's a very good magician he is a missed the fire or any began calling himself a missed the fire he got to drop a magician thing okay and so people are starting to go that way it's part of the mystery art you know\nWhen people go see a magician do they want the trick to fail or succeed what do you think\nWell I think they all want it to succeed I think it'd be a strange individual if you'd like to see the guy fall on his face\nSome people who want to see\nThat maybe maybe uh I don't ah\nActually I Want I Want to see the the trek professor and then try to figure out what happened how we did it\nRight that's me when I when I first went to Disney Land when I was a kid I went through

because it seems to me that since we've gone to the digital age from the analog age they're getting more and more these recordings\n[noise] [noise] yes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to\nUse digital radios to stand the frequencies more quickly a fellow by the name of Frank ... in the nineties figured out that if you go back\nA digital FM radio you can literally break it in such a way so that is that scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station when the signal comes in clear just continually sweeps and again that\nThat's that continuous sweeping has you'll ... if you do that voices and others found sort of a rise out of that noise and\nAgain people will write these words down that they will capture in these very quick sparse moment says it scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with a with a imagine as the spirit world\nHe came up with one is called springs box which is exactly that isn't it [noise]\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful ... very creative um devices that he made and he they became more and more complex\nIt will eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but that was he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything\nIt's some experiments and there were a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think was important was that I was able to sort of get into that\nHad space where I felt that I was doing something that had been\nBeing done for centuries I mean I'm I'm I Would like to make the argument that even somebody like John he who was using his scenes stones to try to communicate with the angels and it and as a result created what magicians called the ... language\nThat use of a scene stone is the same as using a radio to communicate with the spirit world that if this is something that human beings have been attempting to do with some\nMedium mystic device some material device where we take something and we we purpose that we use it in a way that it was originally intended and in fact the magician or the medium becomes I kind of spiritual hacker\nWhere we're really trying to interact with our technologies and the material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know what's really the hackers\nThat have more early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers we probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home [laughter]\nThat's true Peter ... with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book with Jewish mythology and legend surrounding the goal and tell us about that\nYeah I mean I like to think that the goal of them is really the first piece of technology her right where we try to build something in an interview with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the gold them as it's called particularly the colon uh Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel um who are being attacked\nOr there's a poll rum and they're trying to defend themselves\nAnd eventually the goal and become it goes you know it it it it it there's chaos ensues the rabbi could no longer control it and either has to destroy it already has to put it to sleep\nThat one of the stories that goal and grows so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder and a race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles in ... sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories but if you look at the actual\nJewish ... missed this as a mystical writings about the call them the goal of them is in some ways or\nA means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their\nSpiritual ... it's it's almost like a task to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge\nBut the goal in itself is was understood by the rabbis debate just kind of a dumb machine here is a wonderful tell my story where\nA rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal him and he says to them well what can I Do care to speak and they say well no I Can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just a ... it's just the toy [noise]\nBeach is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures right right so we can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretend there's to the throne as it were\nYou know what about the Sherman says well you know in Native American tradition and other types of was a ... cultures new showman Olson seemed to be the person connected to the other side\n[noise] that's right and the Sherman would also use it\nA light off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to do the states have consciousness in their\nPeople and I think that what the ... and what the stage magician does in many ways this\nIs very connected and it also you can access and connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging of spiritualism which spirit cabinet tend to different ways in which people were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet or\nWhat they were using technologies to be able to create the state\nOf consciousness in the audience and so I don't think that it's necessarily all we we don't go to a a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to being chanted we want to ... in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advanced ... I think is something that we belong\nAnd excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a showman is that\nYour experience as\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was ever able to do what was that you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have very interesting thing here where we're people who are considered scientists rationally\nAnd it's not that they were the bunk in because they wanted to just be cynical are skeptical because they really want that there to be the truth is truth Houdini Houdini really want it to him he really wanted to find a medium\nWho could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his nearly departed mother but he couldn't find on all he found or Charlotte but his but he believed that it could be possible\nAnd I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment for ten even if it's just a pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves into\nThose either Houdini by the way you write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on\nThe right yes that's right ...\n... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy but to you as you said he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job as right if he had today's equipment do you think he might be able to do something\n[laughter] navy but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes founded that people are using these things but if you sort of\nA you know move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most ... quickly trying to hide the fact that maybe he really was it is magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in the moment to talk more with Peter a ... his book strange frequencies we've got a link to his publisher Random House to make it easy for you to get the book if you're into this it's a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nFor the super natural stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour well even take your stories here paranormal stories and just your general questions more to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology and its ability to maybe communicate with the other side\nBecause a map is now available gripe loan and know Android Puerto Rico and above\nListen Leiber on demand anywhere any time\nGo to coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today\n\n[noise]\nMaterial death that I mean it it I think it's actually a very American Spirit right I mean there are some scholars a sociologist one particular ... used to talk about you know Protestantism in the area of capitalism that\nSomething about a Protestant American there is some in whereby we want to\nProve our right now is we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right\nAnd I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we are in charge of our own salvation where we want to be right in front of\nOur experience with the divine is is again something that's very human I think particularly American off and\nAnd so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with Barry or with God or vinyl or\nWe often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something the pre existing opening it up and re purpose in it\nAnd so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people would practice magic for millennium right just another example of magic of ... of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between\nRight right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool\nAnd I could we put you Peter in that category [noise]\nMyself yeah well I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that um I tend to believe though that [noise]\nWe have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from it we have to post put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer them maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\nYeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean there is\n... you know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are\nBut this goes you know back to the whole idea that we once used to think that a bit a profit was somebody who had special information for us and now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so\nYou know it for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and [noise]\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual aren't\nAre often considered outsider artists why is that why the people who are working\nWith these themes consider to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular aren't you know mainstream artistic community and I think it's we live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience\nAnd what's interesting about technology is it is and this is really key here to see if I can explain this somebody takes her radio [noise]\nAnd they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio and I'm going to resign or a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world\nBut the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to the Saudi Arabia and have another effect take place the science behind that that even made this radio something that you could find a store\nWhich said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't against ... and yet we can take the things this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that is underneath it scientific method and scientific understanding of the world it's\nIt's underneath and divorced and turn it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can think about technologies in ways that that the science connected to them might actually be in opposition to\nWell you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen on line and somebody came up to you and said Peter ... are you hearing voices of this guy at night\nThings he's out there he's out there and you of course who knew never had a radio you never went on line like that to listen you're probably saying watch this guy talking about he's insane\nOr what my voices out there and seen or heard by millions or if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to is the right kind of receiver [noise]\nWell it's fascinating that you say that because when\nSpiritual is or was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology\nAnd people called medium spiritual mediums spiritual telegraph [laughter] they really believe that there was this link between this\nHis new burgeoning technology and how you're right it was a special in New kind of receiver and transmit her and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nOr you see that being from the television Iraq has really augmented in shape things were spirituality and technology and tell me why\nWell I mean the TV itself is kind of a ... very strange and scary oh yeah it is the some of the the there is a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four\nCalled the blue television company and they actually ... this is how they advertise their television is is what they said\nThe dreams of witches have come true oh my God so they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird\nBut to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right [noise]\nUm and so the the fact that you know week that we used to call those the after effects on TV you know and then when we were used to watch ... VHS stations with an antenna we used to call those dose right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically\nIs is filled to the brim right with these supernatural on a called metaphors and I think that that's really important I think even when we talk about technology that if we're not believers and even if we're just using it we still use these it's language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to dump that this has anything to do with our discussion tonight but a real radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those\n... oh my gosh yeah absolutely yeah\nMy dad had an old field goal radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall\nAnd you know where it was and it was in case in this beautiful piece of wouldn't furniture and had silicone written across it ah it ... it was it was a piece of art in the same we have TVs in the in the stereo so that they started coming out with\nThe Chinese are meant to be central pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like poultry guys comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nHow are you a hundred percent ... Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live in a very women all place what I what I like more than anything and\nBilly believe it is ambiguous states are and chanting steak when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical than somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nI get into your time machine and tell me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regards to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about\nUm maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but we will have transcended to the other side by use of artificial intelligence uploading our consciousness to computers there's a movement of what's called trans humanism and a host humanists\nWho believe that we will become so merge with technology that we will become the new spirit world it it's going to be our consciousness inhabiting this electronic digital realm I'm so I'm I'm more convinced that it's going to be\nNukes now has to specialty Martin argues bus become your new ... give the line at order on line ... dot com for curbside deliberate located in Montgomery offer an Obama guy and open\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center visit W.
