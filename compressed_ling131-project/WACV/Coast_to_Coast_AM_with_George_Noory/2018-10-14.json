house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait\nTill the ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nHow I thought it was just so\nPrecious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary friend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it\nWell started telling him what to do like oh in the beginning it was really sweet like oh sue made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat and I'd be like that Phillies sue you know innocent\nThen\nUh I I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it and my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name\nOf the people and how old is your nephew advertising at this time next okay in\nNight in the middle of the night he came into our bedroom crying and he was offered\nIn scratch mark\nAnd he was leading okay he was bleeding and it looks like he's been fitness all over his body and I pulled off his shirt and he was bruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had his in his hand and I ran down to his room and he had to cut\nThe ear off of our cat and he said the stew made him do it oh dear you said stew I'm Sorry he kept calling it's due this goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry was too well it was after about two or three months my nephew had his speech and pet him and\nAnd really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name\nScott liked me anymore right and before oh it was awful he said to me stupid doesn't want to do any here anymore\nAnd how when did you do did you\nOh my gosh I was so frightened you just even to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um it it was\nThe ...\nWe had to I we had no choice right had no choice oh where did you do that oh we had no choice and then if it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties and like I said\nIn the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that silly stew he stole something again you know and I might find oh my eyeglasses in the freezer or [laughter] or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway\nAnd it was just kind of ... and the beginning and and and fairly innocent but what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but some because see remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several he wins or men you know I'm just going to\nSay that well what we ended up finding out was that it was it was a portal it is it's six three only strongly haunted still\nAnd you are still living there\nNo milk no after five years we did get out we got out and the thing that we left\nThe day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had ... on every level and we took the doorbell about\nThat the batteries out of the doorbell on the first level and then the second level went off we took those batteries out the third level went off it it felt like they were driving us crazy\nLike driving you out would happen celebrating what came of that place what happened to it\nWell actually after we sold it then the Maddox family bought it and this was in two thousand five and they just sold it about two years ago but wildly owned it in two thousand fourteen\nOn a ledge was voted number six on the nation's top ten most haunted places just behind the Lizzie Borden house by USA Today and the Huffington Post\nWho would buy something like that\nIt actually you know what ... ... talk about how about true beauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by someone who turned it into a Buddhist\nA Buddhist retreat and it's wonderful because last I heard is that they cleared all the spirits away and that the house as happy again so I Am really I Would\nTake a lot of work they have done so much work than men with ...\nExperts and they uh they change the gardening they change the direction of certain you know that really works it apparently it worked because it's it's it's free [laughter] fascinating about\nA hundred years yeah it was tremendously haunted and then later after you know me being a historian and everything I Want to know why the house was so haunted\nAnd I won't get into that right now but I really did find out that there was a reason there always is anytime something tragic or horrible happens it leaves a psychic in in print or bruises if you will that can be felt by some people and I'm One of those people unfortunately\nCan do it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives and\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children's stepmother um their mother died of cancer when they were one and three years old\nAnd so um they're both very smart people on both of them there have their doctorates agree my son interesting enough um is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never saw a ghost when we were leaving it on a ledge or experience something paranormal\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to know he\nHad an analytical mind do want to become a doctor ensured that\nLate he totally turned it out so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nI knew I knew what he tells his friends so young my mom's to go to honor and\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally [laughter]\nOh it has to be validated you\n... oh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling now used to live in ... springs right Joes a little of the history of that area\nWell this I Believe this is one this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right yeah\nOh well this was his home base he used to hang out here all the time\nBecause we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in all of the Rockies ... and I'm so he actually builds lab on the top of pikes peak the man he was fascinated with managed to springs especially because we have some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter of the magnitude springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have\nIn my school shaken my hand and never find true north I kid you not the the Indian American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in these sacred places the trees actually grow kind of fight ways I'm just curious ... the hair on my back on my arms and my neck will go up and ... um you can feel it um and the other thing that's curious about it is that\nBecause of these magnetic anomalies\nUm Nikola Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just\nGoing over managed to springs like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find\nTheir way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of him type crystal and their brain and it would be he was saying he was speculating that maybe because of the magnetic anomalies the Brits were hunting confused because they were actually\nBehaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and and like kamikaze pilots [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managers Springs Colorado when we come back with my guest Tiffany waters I'm listening to coast to coast am\n\nUm I think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pact\nBetween them that they would not\nFight them and they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nWhat have you right over their natural minerals springs that was but it was sacred to them and that the natives actually curse the town after that and that's why it's so hot that makes sense to me [laughter]\nYeah it does yeah it does now you live there I Do\nAnd you like it\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here and I am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened okay a year ago it was September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge now this ... body\nIt was awful he said was suicide um come to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a\nHigh incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to um\nProcess it but they they don't know how to channel the energy of manage to that is the right and that that's why they're so\nAnd that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly channel this energy for the powers of good [laughter] if you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't\n... it will turn against you it will become a negative force\nAnd I know that because it happened to me when I first moved here\nAnd I see it happening to other people when I warned them my a godsend moved in with me a year ago and I said I was trying to help him out he was going through a hard time and I have this beautiful addict apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and bathroom and I said he could live there for free is needed to get a job\nHe was only here for a week and he you know the the spirit a manatee Wilber took him and he goes I can feel what I can feel that I've never felt so good in my life [laughter] I said well he got to be careful well he burned out and about a month and [laughter] and it was really sad how\nShe just people process that energy wherever they live if it's a haunted house or if it's a a relative how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around in a negative energy anymore like I said I\nI Try to keep you know a healthy attitude about it if if I can call it bad [laughter] because you have to think about this why is it goes here why aren't they lingering that can't be good [laughter]\nBecause there is a result business right\nWell yeah but I mean that's that's that's a lot of anger too if you think about it and [noise] um what do you say that\nYou would have to have a lot of anger to be ... it to be tethered here\nUm if you are a full life and full of love and full of price consciousness but everyone all it I don't think you'd be tethered here after life I think that you would want to move on and toward the light um\nYou know you got a good point there is you know these beings want just each other's here to hunter disrupt people because they have a crunch\nWell some of them I Believe our conscious and some of them I don't think that they know that they are here still but they're they're all troubled I you know I Love these stories when people go on my bed and breakfast is haunted but only by a friendly spirit I'm like give me a great there\nAre no such thing as a friendly those Casper or otherwise\n[laughter] will because it why would they why would they ... that's a good point\nIt's trawling it's trawling and and when you sit around with this okay it can it can lead you\nDown a dark road okay I've seen it happen to my friends I mean\nI don't watch TV and I haven't for Twenty years and it's funny that I'm In this business because now all these goes hunting shows are on television\nAnd I guess in the last year or two you hear all these stories about these people that are on these goes hunting shows and they kill each other and [laughter] you heard about this stuff I think they get involved into a dark force you know it's nothing to play around with\nWell our own goes troubled and our own lives\nThat I Believe so I think that everyone has a different opinion now I Want to tell you something this last book that I just wrote was actually written because of a ghost\nI was called on the telephone to write a story to help this poor person who has been demonized for the last hundred years I helped her cross over by writing this last book and I have that that's a matter of fact\nIs that been forgotten jails and Colorado is\nBoth legends and lore of the Rockies by ship for and it just came out and the very first story\nIs true I Swear to God Knows about it [laughter]\nAbout its they've actually begins in Nineteen eighty five I was a college student\nAnd I decided to go to this little mining town to um interview the owners of this old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book [laughter] anyway they go to I go to the theater\nAnd I have an amazing paranormal experience where I actually saw the former owner of the theater and she was crying and she was upset because her name had been painted\nWell I didn't know what to do when I got back to school I'm not going to write this story they are going to think I'm not ...\nDid not tell this story to anyone you know I've been single since I was little kids so I sometimes to just put it out in my mind and don't tell anyone okay so now flash forward to two thousand sixteen\nI have written for books on got goes legends lore of the Rocky Mountains was quite happy to rest on my little Rory laurels\nAnd I ... out of the blue got a telephone call\nFrom the Colorado alarm company a\nBath and intrusions signal on Harrison Avenue and those historians out there might know where that is\nOnly a historian with no where that was\nAnd that being said this was a message left on my home number now I was getting ready to take a walk I heard the phone rang and I was like I'm not going to get it but something told me to get it so five minutes later I went and checked the phone and I'm like oh my gosh this is an intrusion signal at the at the this\nPlace you know up in the mountains and I'm like well call me I'm three hours a day\nAnd and furthermore I mean only I Would know where this place is because I'm a historian I mean this was really weird not even the same area code or anything so I called the Colorado alarm can be right back and I said why are you calling me is your tax number I don't even have the same area code as as this place\nAnd it was a myth that answered the phone and it was a woman's voice on my answering machine and the man said I don't know what you're talking about lady and I gave my phone number and he goes we didn't call your house\nAnd I said I've got it on my answering machine he goes I don't know what you're talking about you're going to have to take this up with a theater [laughter] I call the police department and I said you know your alarms going off at the theater and they go yeah I got were on our way [laughter]\nNext morning I called the mayor of a discount on most of the name I called the mayor I called the theater I Hope everybody I put nobody could give me an answer\nSo did you still have that voice on yet so I might everybody listen to the first person I called was one of my dear friends dory spent my business partner sees a psychic she's been on good morning America she's pretty well known and when they said don't let the devil is going on with this and she listens to\nThe tapes you know on my tape recorder on my answering machine I let her listen to it\nAnd she went into a trance and she did a reading and she we found out that I had the same birthday as the former owner of this I'm old theater\nAnd a lot more in common that was just mind blowing and my friend said to me you were destined to write a story about this crying goes because she is very sad\nThat she has been demon all these all these years and no one has hurt her side of the story and she wants you to correct it for her\n[laughter] you're kidding me and I said if you don't know I'm not saying you so I called I called the um the manager of this theater and I told her all of this I go I Know you're going to make us think I'm Crazy relation to this message and she calls me back and she goes I Want you to come up here by\nYour cells all alone watch the the oldest in the winter okay\nI don't care come on up so I get there and she lets me inside and she said if I tell you this [laughter] you know my neck is at stake that's why I'm not

land\nYeah I I say thanks every day you know to the good lord to the spirits that the to the land that be and I give\nThere is a legend about managed to springs that you're not allowed to leave annoys you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson\nYou don't come here because it's a choice you mark his son and to this town and I know that sounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and I always ask them I said what brought you to manage to springs hallways the same story it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran\nOut of gas and stuff like that\nAnd when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\nMm interesting so let's go back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to these types of energy or maybe you have a ghost in your house or\nSomething that might be visiting you what do you suggest to people that maybe don't want you want to transition wanted to move on already yeah\nSee I think that when someone dies [noise]\nNow I I Want to ... this with make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings I think when someone dies for the first three days or so that maybe their spirit lingers but they stay here are some people believe that some you know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not both [laughter]\nUm other stay right up but if there is a lingering energy in your ...\n[laughter] they usually owns that particular person I didn't\nSee I earlier in the conversation I did say that my house has haunted that I live in now and that I Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes peak Bible college that has a very interesting history\nAnd anyhow the other day band that it is that the veil is so thin this time of year I actually heard choir and music in my house I've lived here for Fifteen Years have never heard that before when I ran into the dining room and then it it ceased [laughter]\nI Know it was inside of my house I heard it my dogs hurt it they weren't Halloween is going on\nI think that's a residual it's like a group in time you know quantum physicist and explain it better than I can but I just think of it is like ... toast you can still smell the front so that it's gone yeah\nI live in time makes more sense where it could be a coming back into this dimension temporarily in a split second\nYes and see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard did not have a consciousness we mean by no means and it was just like I heard it in the room like some it was a burping time does that make sense to have a conscious\nIt's yeah it's just music that I heard like they came through sometimes believe it or not I can hear the train that used to run behind my house that ran in over a hundred years yeah so yeah when I hear so I don't know with other people do [laughter]\nYou have anybody around that you could ask them much\nMore in tune with the higher laws of nature as I said look at least they can they can pick up on it too had children especially that's why I Love it when when little children come on my tour is because um I turned it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much but ah the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to the\nRight right so back to where people feel that they're afraid of ghost you're saying that they're not [noise] usually wanting to stay they want to move on or they should leave on it and\nMove on I think it would be like you know when you're hungry you just know to eat\nHow do you help but a ... being do that how would you suggest or how would you teach someone to us and this goes to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it [laughter] I Swear it works what would you ask\nI tell it are you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I notice is your house and you love it that you're not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones are waiting for you on the other side you need to go\nAnd just talk to them like a kind of person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get caught here it's it's really sad if you think about these those hunters that go out and our teasing them like they're\nLike they're like in the zoo or something you know he's not very nice\nLooking Ghostbusters where they could vacuum them up and put them into two yeah when you ask where you say to this entity that might be hanging around and causing Mr move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that you know what those hunting is addicting first of all it is so fascinating we've all been fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop and that it's like gambling or something you open\nUp a whole new world upon the moon and I\nCan't believe this happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest and when you do have it happen\nBlows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw the that's what happened to me when I was a child\nYeah and the head when I was a baby imagine that so I mean they all my life I was told that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter] people have had habits\nEnthusiastic I Would say but now tell wish to he started this wonderful convention this paranoia ... mentioned travels to various areas tell us a little bit about\nWell um we call it a mood move all these like I said and so when we go into different areas the very very very first thing that we do is we contact with the local historian\nAnd the local goes hunting room and we say we want to be or advocate we are here to help you and your community it do you need to get rid of any we're here we're not going to be like those guys though were really like I Would call us paranormal psychologist [laughter]\nThere's such a ... yes\nAnd that's what we do and we're very kind and we're and we try to talk them over or do whatever we can write a book\nThese so when you do the tours you have a group that comes with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words it's because the town itself is very active and this is how I Do my towards um if you look at my website manage elections that time you will see that there's very little information\nOn there after Seventeen years there's a reason for that I don't have a meeting site because before my chores I actually do a prayer and a meditation on after the spirits which one wants to come out and talk tonight so the tours do change night by night and you'd never know which there is going to come out and play quite interesting [laughter]\nOh yeah does that do say specific date and time and all that you think are not as validated\nNo I didn't say that at all I'm just saying that's how I run my tours okay there are always different they always change because that's how the paranormal is it's always changing it's always different but there are some parents that are pretty consistent\nBut I think it's much like fishing I mean as much as I Love to go fishing sometimes I don't catch it's darn thing\nAnd that's how it goes hunting is you just never know what's going to happen and then sometimes he'll it'll be hot and you'll catch a bunch of\nGoes like goodness All right we're going to take a quick break and we're going to come
