and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and a invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\n[noise] yeah and uh probably the one case and you know about it the Minnesota Wild man\nThat has a lot of injury to because I've seen pictures of it and I've seen descriptions of it and it is unusual and nobody quite knows what happens to it\nBut a lot of people just to Pruitt sale you know was that was a fake meant for the circus but the more you dig into that one there was something strange with that\nWhile I find myself rooting for the wild man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ends up that way you know you look at where are these reports come from there from major these are major newspapers too I mean the Boston Globe and the San Francisco newspaper LA Times or\nAnd they and it's some great writing some of these descriptions is just terrific writing\nIt it's somebody wasn't just phoning it in a when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas or that's not where we associate big foot sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why would Ohio in Pennsylvania be so prominent in the numbers and it's because\nI mean that was the center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundreds or so Seventeen eighties where the bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there are people out here as well but\nUh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived a\nHug factly and [noise] it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the fighting locations in conjunction to the giants sightings and skeletons and then if\nYou go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first establish\nCivilization and cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even weirder thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings\nWell that's Bruce Maccabee with Ohio is a friend and I went to spend four or five days within earlier this year and the strange things that he's told me that have happened in Ohio in the air and on the ground it's really strange\n[laughter] Bruce Maccabee a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy a boat in person and on the air and in his books or you know it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big blood or sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWide I'd never heard of him either and a\nAgain a surprising surprising fact that they're right about it from there and then end up ... they there's an article from there about a citing when you look at the descriptions that they're offering almost like Dennis Goldberg what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts\nAnd then when you think about present day fighting's\nAgain from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm you know some of the descriptions obviously you have to take him in a cultural context now I don't remember\nThere are mostly um you know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that that you've collected here\nCorrect and or I or people always telling me well what about the star wars creature that looks like Bigfoot now I'm kind of strange\nThat it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it is a similarity\nUm some of the descriptions I I I Would have to leave the right here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of thing which suggests to me maybe they were humans may be rigged they really were literally wild men out there\n[noise] and usually and occasionally even nowadays you hear about big for wearing clothing\nAnd kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but you know maybe it's\nSome association maybe they're trying to break a barrier if they're seen [noise] maybe they think they'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared you know we could all thrown our conjecture about why that may be happening but it happens too often for people to be fabricating it I\nI hear it occasionally but not very often\nUm\nIf you were to communicate with the tribe these days a ... a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the hope is is are there any other tribes ... would say people that have a relationship one going with or whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one I mean there's there's famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico on the high plains out there where uh they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where they\nPut people start their head start spinning but fact\nWe're there's this association between big for it in UFOs even in the hoop a book I wrote that many of the tribal people said they saw a UFO and coast time and space to the point where they saw big for it and they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds and\nWhen you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars and they're they're not once they have your trust that will tell you hey\nYou know there's this association between us and them and they're different kind of try and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did and\nWhen you start to go back and you look at the history of these certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big put people to die hards don't like at\nThe UFO die hards like it even less or they they're not comfortable with that at all but you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are in the wake you up those are where they're from\nBut um there was enough cases are over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book\nYou can ignore it I I thought the interest there was a couple of stories clippings where there are a reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures\nAre engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual for several years ago\nIt's on a dairy farm and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that they may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nThey own a huge dairy farm and he went out there and talk to them and there's oh I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely no\nAnd goes I don't understand it [laughter] then the same man\nTold him he said you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property and something tells me don't turn around it back on the horse or get back on my a TV and Rowley and he does\nAnd then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out the corner of the property I don't know how it got there I saw on\nDogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust somebody to dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories that they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruit\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are\nSeen them take deer terror there an omnivore and many times when the natives are in the middle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer\nThat stuck up on a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound here a native ... could have done it and they don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's not a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast to coast they\nSo good job on your finding um I Want him to talk about the big thing I actually think you're I really love how you're saying how it's related wild man\nI'm I feel like Rome or off of the way that we could find out more about wild men because there are Amazonian tribe network has discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour idea is revolutionary and I went from the Knight had years will definitely have an answer because it around and my question is you know like you're going to use drones in your research at all\n[noise] drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones were going to be good for finding it for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on this and people are asking worked real well and you can't use a drone in a national park it's against the wall and there's a huge crime so probably won't happen [noise]\nThat George Bush is going to the next call I had a question for you and maybe you should have got to touch on it for the people here [noise] your work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big can you tell us about that\nAre actually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers\nAnd we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal browns they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and uh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was\nA just outside the window and as soon as the dog's made a noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running and it went all the way through the community\nAnd you could hear it I mean it was just taking these giant stride it knocked over garbage cans you had alarms going off in the police officers chased it\nAh I think they've they've found some tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there this just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared or they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself\nI should call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we've described on the program before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin Walker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floating just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it and through infrared you can see the the ball of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the er at the entrance to this uh this tunnel stands up it's eight feet tall feature lists dark humanoid shaped like ahead with no neck on a on a body it just stands up and then starts moving up towards getting Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and\nThere have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh\nUh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um has seen it all over the you went to a base and so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures\nThat are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual phenomena and we don't know um west of the Rockies Kyle in Utah I Kyle welcome to the program\nHow you doing All right so in your mind so\n[noise] so I had um you're talking to David Was talking about Joseph ... spent the one that you talk the Cain on his saddle hum he thought Bigfoot\nAnd it happened in Eighteen or over five star Eighteen thirty five he was on his way to another town and go ... and he was in the ... the prophet and he ... he ran into a cane and uh he described Cain as the\nAs a tall a figure that was taller than a saddle\nAnd ah Joseph ... says topic Cain and the heat and came to introduce it still is I'm a man on earth longer here and there and I my goals will basically he he wanted to make men misery or the destroyed their souls\nYou brought that up I just thought in Mormon culture LDS coal ... that we have you know there's two story there really famous that story than just to leave this too is Joseph ... his nephew\nKnow his brother had an encounter Leslie Smith a in Hawaii at the dedication and the bin ... Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one uh came came to read the doors of the temple and I'm In his hand or\nA Wesley Smith said that he that was the priesthood to cast came out and somebody he wants his hand and they just kind of a catch ... and so it's interesting you say that because in our church you know like some people who are skeptical like they are kind of hush hush let's not talk about it\nBut as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I just wanted for David like with the disappearances 'cause I've been reading his book for a little while and stuff\nI Do take it it's a big foot he said he can he does he have any idea what's going on because like people are asking me you know like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you a coyote let everyone listening here to tonight is probably the the weirdo experts in their family and then there are social social circle\nA you and uh and everyone listening is likely they go to person in their own circles for information about these kind of topics they are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that\nLikely a big foot type encounter or is that something else\nWill the description that the Smith gave was ... but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the big ... may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nOf Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that may joined the two topics\nAnd other things like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him and he never said it mine spoke but more\nHard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things I've always stated that I'm a man of facts all of my books are filled with facts\nThere aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that because there are no facts to to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect\nWhen you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA but\nAgain if you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my eight books and they have been thousands that has come to me and said I Know exactly what's happening\nNow and I should point out that you know you did to address this may be Kyle didn't hear it but there are no credible stories in your view of big what being responsible for recording people off as far as you know\n[noise] well no no killing them I I think I'm going okay there's there's a story that John Green wrote about a prospect or that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man and he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dumped put him in a cave\nAnd he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them\nA it's a it's a really really good story who and the individual at the time sign an affidavit I followed green leading the this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kinda how came came to pass\nI remember that story now yeah that is a good one isn't there some other account in one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big foot type creature carrying a person through the forest\nAnd ...\nYou know I think\nSo well there's a story out of Wyoming\nThat ... I I don't put much Clinton said it because people didn't come forward and they were doing something illegal but a girl disappeared and Wyoming\nAnd to uh people who are poaching we're out in the woods and they claimed that they saw big for carrying this body under its arm it appear dead so these people never came forward I don't know who they are a district was given to me from another\nAnd it's a place where everybody knows your name you get all this for one price under one roof from\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control centers as is W.

man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ends up that way you know you look at where are these reports come from there from major these are major newspapers too I mean the Boston Globe and the San Francisco newspaper LA Times ah\nAnd they and it's some great writing some of these descriptions is just terrific writing it it's somebody wasn't just phoning it in a when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas\nA that's not where we associate big foot sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why would Ohio in Pennsylvania be so prominent than the numbers and it's because I mean that was a center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundreds or so Seventeen eighties\nWhere the bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there are people out here as well but\nUh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived\nOr exactly and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the fighting locations in conjunction to the giants sightings and skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first establish\nCivilization and cities that as\nWe move west where were these locations but then even weirder thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings well that's Bruce Maccabee with Ohio he's a friend and I I went to spend four or five days within earlier this year\nAnd the strange things that he's told me that have happened in Ohio in the air and on the ground really strange\n[laughter] Bruce Maccabee a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy a boat in person and on the air and in his books or you know what it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big butter sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWide I'd never heard of him either and ah [noise] again a surprising surprising fact that they're writing about it from there and then in the ... they there's an article from there about siting when you look at the descriptions that they're offering\nAlmost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts and then when you think about present day sightings again from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm you know some of the uh descriptions obviously you have to take him in a cultural contacts now I don't remember when the jokes\nUm you know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that that you've collected here\nCorrect\nAnd uh I people always tell me well what about the star wars creature that looks like Bigfoot [laughter] and now I'm kind of strange\nThan it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it is a similarity\nUm some of the descriptions I I Would have to leave their we're here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of thing which suggests to me maybe they were humans may be read they really were literally wild men out there\n[noise] and usually\nOccasionally even nowadays you hear about it for wearing clothing and kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but\nYou know may be some association maybe they're trying to break a barrier if they're seen maybe they think there'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared you know we could all thrown our conjecture about why that may be happening but it happens too often for people to be fabricating it I\nI hear it occasionally but not very often [noise]\nUm\nIf you were to communicate with to try these days a ... a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the hope is is are there any other tribes you would say people that have a relationship one going with or whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one I mean there's there's a famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico and the high plains out there where\nUh they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where they could people start their head start spinning but fact\nWhere there's this association between big for it in UFOs\nEven in the book I wrote that many of the tribal people said that they saw a UFO and coast time and space to the point where they saw big foot\nAnd they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds\nAnd when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars and they're they're not once they have your trust they will tell you hey\nYou know there's this association between us and them and there are different kind of try and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did\nAnd when you start to go back and you look at the history of the certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWhile they are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big but people to die hards don't like it\nThe UFO diehards a like an even less uh they they're not comfortable with that at all\nBut you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are and what you up those are where they're from but um there was enough cases are over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book\nYou can't ignore it I I thought the interest there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures\nAre engaging but cows milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual for several years ago\nAnd I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that they may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nThey own a huge target for anyone out there and talk to them and there's all this I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely email\nAnd goes I don't understand it [laughter] and then\nThe same man told them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me don't\nTurn around it back on the horse or get back on my ... a TV and leave and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner the property I don't know how it got their so called\nDogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust somebody to dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruit\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take dear to their an omnivore and many times when the natives are in the middle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer\nThat stuck up on a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pounds here a native ... could have done it and they don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's not a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big wild bend a giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast to coast am\nSo good job on your finding 'em I wanted to talk about the big thing I actually think you're I really love how you were saying how it's related wild man\nI'm I feel like Rome or off though is the way that we can find out more about wild men because there are Amazonian tribe that were just discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour idea of revolutionary and I went from the Knight hadn't years will definitely have an answer because of their own and my question is easy it's like you're going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually from a PHD level people that thought the drones are going to be good for finding big for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on missing people are asking work real well and you can't use a drone in a national park it's against the wall and there's a huge crime so probably won't happen [noise]\nThat George Bush is going to the next call I had a question for you and maybe you should have got to touch on it for the people here [noise] your work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big ... can you tell us about that\nActually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers\nAnd we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal grounds they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and\nUh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was a just outside the window and as soon as the dogs mated noise and the this thing looked at the officers and shown a light on it it took off running and it went all the way through the community\nAnd you could hear it it I mean it was just taking these giant stride it knocked over garbage cans you head alarms going off in the police officers chased it\nAh I think they've they've found some tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there that's just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared or they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself\nI shouldn't call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we've described on the program before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin Walker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floating just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it ... through infrared you can see the the ball of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the er at the entrance to this uh this tunnel stands up it's eight feet tall I'm a teacher list dark humanoid shaped like ahead with no neck on a on a body it's just stands up and then starts moving up towards getting Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and they can tell ya\nSaying but are there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh\nUh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um has seen it all over the you went to base and so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures\nAre that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual phenomena and we don't know\nUm west of the Rockies Kyle in Utah I Kyle welcome to the program\nHow you doing All right so in your mind so\n[noise] so I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph ... spent the ones you talked to Kane on his saddle\nUm he saw big foot and it happened in Eighteen or over five star Eighteen thirty five he was on his way to another town to go ... and he was the ... the prophet\nAnd he ... he ran in the Cain and uh he described Cain as the as a tall a figure that was taller than the saddle and ah Joseph ... says topic Cain and the heat and Kaine introduced this though is that I'm a man\nI'm personally wanders here and there and I my gold\nWill basically he she wanted to make men misery or the destroyed their souls says you brought that up I just thought in mourning culture LVS coach or that we have you know there's two stories are really famous story than a chose to leave their shoe is Joseph ... his nephew\nKnow his brother had an encounter Leslie Smith in Hawaii at the dedication and the bin Laden Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one\nUh came came to read the doors of the temple and I'm In his hand or\nA Wesley Smith said that he that was the priest and to calf came out and so he runs his hand and name is currently cash yeah and king raw and so it's interesting you say that because in our church you know like some people who are skeptical like hey they're kind of hush hush let's not talk about it\nBut as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I just wanted for David like with the disappearances because I've been reading his book for a little while and stuff\nI Do think it's it's a big foot do you think it's all he does he have any idea what's going on 'cause like people are asking me you know like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you a coyote let everyone listening here to tonight is probably the the weirdo expert in their family and then there are social social circle\nA you and uh and everyone listening is likely they go to person in their own circles for information about these kinds of topics they are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that\nLikely a big foot type encounter or is that something else\nWell the description that the Smith gave was would match big for it but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the big ... may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nA Scott Carpenter another researcher and the big world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that may joined the two topics\nAnd the other thing like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him and he never said in mind spoke\nHard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things\nI've always stated that I'm a man of facts all of my books are filled with facts\nThere aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that there are no facts to to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect\nWhen you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA\nBut again if you stick with the facts and\nAllow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my eight books and they have been thousands that has come to me and said I Know exactly what's happening\nAnd I should point out that you know you did address this may be Kyle didn't hear it but there are no credible stories in your view of big what being responsible for recording people off as far as you know\n[noise] well no no killing them I I think going okay there's there's a story that John Green wrote about a prospect or that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man and he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended\nUp dumped put him in a cave and he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them a it's a it's a really really good story\nWho and the individual at the time sign an affidavit I followed green leading the this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kinda how came came to pass\nI remember that story now yeah that is a good one is it there are some other account in one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big foot type creature carrying a person through the forest\nDoesn't ring a bell\nYou know I think uh [noise]\nSo well there's this story out of Wyoming\nThat I I don't put much credence that because the people didn't come forward and they were doing something illegal but a group disappeared Wyoming\nAnd to uh people who were poaching we're out in the woods and they claimed that they saw big for carrying this body under its arm it appeared dead so these people never came forward I don't know who they are a district was given to me but
