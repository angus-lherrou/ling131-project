what good are spells the if you can't learn anything\nYou know I think that the power of our minds\nBecause I have discovered one thing I have discovered with magic is that in\nMy mind is more powerful than I realized so I think that when we start healing on so many different levels that we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance and spiritual abundance so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will\nConjure up a money spell and work that\nBut right now I've just been focused on doing the um healing and crossing and reversal\nWhen you talk about magic

it was going up and down on my left ear and so it was really really crazy so at that point it was either fight or flight and I obviously couldn't sleep because I was ten down so\nThis wave of courage just came over me and I just thought you know I I ... I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just thought and as soon as I\nI made that adjustment in my mind I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just peeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm I just hung up and went up and I'm not kidding George\nI felt a hairy leg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone\nBut it just like it flew away obviously\nThat's freaky it is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't believe me\nBut I did go back to that psychic woman like what happened but yeah it's so freaking and I will say it never happen again after that time so I Know that this man some and that even incentive my way but I did not sleep without the light off for about three months after that it totally terrified me\nWho were who is susceptible to the Baltic possessions and in situations like that it works\nWell you know I'm not going to list did they say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail for drawing crocheting yeah we're we're going to the ... the cemetery it you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um there is one reason I think that\nMany of them were you ever to laugh you don't have a ... which uh which should have a capital\nA which is actually a wise woman so that's the definition of a wage but yeah I think you [laughter] I'm\nKind of wanted a ... [laughter]\nI Can't do it even if I tried [laughter] I'm Still one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand\nI'm considering we all lived thousands of lifetimes I'm and I'm Glad I have to remember any of them [noise] um some of these lifetime so we were not the best of people and um it's very possible that this is my theory and it could be wrong but\nI have proof for my ... who kind of confirmed um my you know my thoughts about this um it's very possible that some of these people these victims or experiencing what is known as karma\nHarassed and molested in this lifetime with the demon the theater packed with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in his lifetime on the team in the past is\nUsually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of a demon die unless you've like\nSlate you cast them all but they don't wanna guard exactly there's\nThousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at Georgia it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life the demons and what's going to happen when we read incarnate and the demon is going to probably harass him and molest them now that's one one theory and I can say\nI'm with confirmation that it's it's it's probably very true because my ... has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of of people who are being molested harassed and just you know possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a shower Monica journey into their past lives\nAnd nail it and nine times out of ten these people have made packs with demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which and you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so what she does is she just\nBreaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know these demands are not bothering your neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified sharman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark forces you want to ... what what do they want with us\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity due to feed off of\nAbsolutely and I'm sadly a lot of black magicians will\nCast spells against people who they feel they can steal like from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and the book into us however they do it\nAnd what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent so this is why it is extremely important especially right now um to to really really really really\nClear ourselves on a daily basis and do vanishing rituals prayers and and ... our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases\nOf a demon intrusions and people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um manipulate our thoughts\nLet's go to the phones for you know camping in Redding, California started our cats go ahead\nI George how are you are I'm good thank you I got I'm losing my voice so I Hope you can hear me are so good okay Hi Curtis Hi um my husband\nAnd I both but I think curse school friend\nOr boy\nIt wasn't but a year\nAfter he and I got together but an accident occurred to me and I brought it up to him a couple of months later [laughter] you know do you think that this person is cause I I mean just fucking out are divided\nAnd I mean she might even have a dog but I told him I said do you think that it's possible that this person could have put a curse on me and he looked to me and said absolutely\nWhile she obviously when they broke up did not go peacefully didn't you\nKnow and actually she helped him move into his apartment and it was like God opened the door for me to leave my ex husband before that you know an apartment became available was perfect timing I got in there\nAnd and part right for maintenance Kevin ... vote for him later down the road it was it was totally like doors opening\nInducing Kathy this curse the lawn you\nYes I Do George I fell down the fight is there room for\nMorning I was going for morning walks every morning before work well this particular morning\n[noise] ha ha\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\nHa ha [noise]\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control centers visit W.

we've had very fortunate yeah I mean when we know there it is out there on occasion a sound here [laughter] ... and we bought a political thing\nWe've lost some greet supporters and you follow the G ... from the astronaut force a Gordon Cooper believe that he had seen something ender Michel ... probably the best astronaut for us\nUh to be a believer in in that are we with a new crop of astronauts\nAre any anymore are we getting that kind of support any more\n[noise] you don't hear about a mud you don't know ... on the other hand I Would say the great majority of people like ... the notion that ... there are some of them might be coming here\nWhen you find out how many planets there are that came as a great shock to a lot of people one point six planets superstar you gotta be crazy\nAnd that may be conservative\n... yeah ... that may not be letting the actual number but it changes our perspective hurt should change our perspective about ourselves and also\nThe age of the system you know we're not talking about the life began of his ... years ago\nAnd it's at least a few million years ago\nAnd that makes a big difference and how important they are if you're not the first second or ... you know ... there's been a buildup of knowledge\nOf awareness of what's going on out there and you know on a on a long a slogan for a long time ... comes from doing things differently and predictable way\nAnd I'm waiting for the next step in behind beyond nuclear fusion but there's a heck of a ... minute I'm burning would've no fire burning coal ah food nuclear fission a nuclear fusion\nAnd ooh ... naturally being the kind of ... we are\nWe're not a lot of energy for killing hey I'm from ... to do\nOn column H bombs et cetera but also learning when we can make use of energy for a good if you will or you know it's kind of like a nuclear submarine\nThat can go around the world under water [noise] kind of special chooses his own way of keeping the pieces ear other guy doesn't know where you're at ... and he doesn't dared to attack you because they know that you can respond back and you can't do anything about as big oh shut up there on some\nSay in the ... what do you think about the the push for disclosure is going to happen for these groups are doing their thing and I don't know what do you say\nI Am not convinced that it was going to happen soon partly because [noise] the worst things on this planet that are at ...\n... to decide on a course of action is beneficial for the planet in ... me too long when there's a lot of the planet you know I'm kind of new one's good for me and not for you when it's a chair explains the lab\nIs still plenty of by going on in the military budgets of may be shrunk a little bit but ah we're still looking toward a strength on the strong arm approach to getting things done\nOr go in and landed him from climbers so for the ruler of my not everybody else is doing it [noise] we\nWe haven't decided how to use them majority of the energy available\nFor the benefit of mankind a one hour to take power from the public from getting power and [noise]\nWe've got some lessons to learn a we teach our children but they can always have what you want a much as it might be nice for you and may not be nice for some other people who are who you interviewed or trying to do them and\nSo it is fortunate that we haven't had a great more\nImagined the restraint George Will it's hard to imagine you had a H bombs on the climate for ... years not one has been used against a society [noise] so that's a sign of hope restraint\n... passion I Hope to David ... you know David Jacobs right Oh yes none of them for a long time to David ... is a believer that whatever's happening here it's not a good thing that there's you know some evil evil ETs out there and do you what do you think of that\nWell I'm I Can't prove to you but there are not evil tease out there on the other hand I have to point out uh you know that three much more advanced than we are to be capable them destroying almost everything on the climate\nAnd if you put your mind to it and isn't it amazing that we haven't done a couple of thousand nuclear warheads sitting around the world and none of them have been used\nThat's remarkable it is shown restraint I'm not saying that makes it was great guys\nBut it's the first step toward good senses to restrain from using only killing tools you have how about helping to ... so I I'm an optimist orange or you always end then\nWhy not life is good at math the work at it or they're bad things in the world of course for sure we can do something of that\nAnd um and\nLike I say restraint seems to be the word the uppermost in many leaders mine's recognition if I get them they'll get may and look good away and\nWhy don't we hear too much about a abduction cases anymore gosh you know in the seventies and sixties that's all\nWe heard a rush right now we I think we take it for granted that theory limbs or maybe it will hurt your haven't talked to any live leaders or maybe they ... yeah maybe they got all and me a raccoon up enough uh and\nMight not be surprising I I have a great deal of them have immunity of humanity it's pushed a little ... and ...\nNews to restrain as I said two thousand to grow up in certain around and nobody's using them and I'm pleased about it because it

calls as well stance with us for about twenty four more minutes or so\nStand he wrote a book with Kathleen Martin was the niece of Bette hill called captured which is still for me one of the greatest UFO stories of abductions I've ever read it is one of the reasons I got into this business\nBecause when look magazine came out with the interrupted journey or the story of Barney and Benny Hill I mean I was just mesmerized even at a young age\nHow would you categorized that case the Barney and Betty he'll case\nWell I think it's a very important case and for several reasons I'm On the people are not talking about people who don't have a reputation and we're not talking about people who are trying to seek attention to her attention sake but he was a social worker\nOr respected member of the community [noise] she had a mixed marriage with Barney MBAs black shoes and why that was very unusual nearly sixty\nIt took guts for them to come out that's right and they were very concerned about what the reaction would be a\n... this was an early sixties and you know it got to ... if you're going to have people who set a new standard of what's going on you got to have people who can handle the hate speech [laughter] and so on\nNineteen sixty eight I guess and I'm\nA buddy on when I'm Around a long time for ... for which I Am glad and uh [noise] it was a good case to set the ball rolling so to speak on the whole business of abductions and interactions with him about sensationalized\nI mean let's face it stand back and say betting Barney where specimens for somebody\nAnd they weren't ... treated but they certainly weren't going on for the glory and and claiming all kinds of ... things as being part of their interaction with the aliens are\nAnd you know I I was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet them early on\nI ... and I I was very impressed and I was impressed by something else uh the media and in that case a K in Pittsburgh biggest station in town and uh [noise]\nUh you know I I ... that's where I made my view and on the air so to speak and they called me and told me that they were bringing Betty and Barney into town and told me where they were staying\nAnd which is very unusual yeah and I contacted them we had dinner together or just the three of us\nAnd I had a chance to you know one on one kind of thing and I was very very impressed and I had known what to expect because I hadn't bell and stuff like this I mean it isn't that crazy story aliens grab the couple a an interracial couple\nIn those days you were just getting into this field weren't you well yeah I mean you have you done it pretty early on was early yeah\nAnd the sixties and for longer in the sixties or seventies or eighties that's right no\nTill I was very fortunate to have met them one on one so to speak and I saw it in the ... conferences didn't get too many meetings with Barney because he died within two years when I first met him a lesson that\nAre very has gone on that and of course I worked very closely with that he's nice Kathleen Martin we've done three books together and ah\nAnd that's been a pleasure to a is often you find it can break with people and I have a co written ... books will will with other people but we seem to be compatible\nYou you you too clicked and she's great in in the field and you follow due to a ... person you don't and ... when I was that Twenty one year old reporter who interviewed you one of the other interviews I did was with Dr Benjamin Simon who ... who is the psychiatrist who\nWho studied Betty and Barney hill and this is I'll I'll always remember this because he was in Boston I interviewed them over the phone I'm In Detroit\nAnd in a you know I'm I'm obsessed with the story and I asked him license so what do you think Dr a ball they're\nTelling you the truth or not what do you think he said I I don't know if the story happened or not but I Will tell you what I Do believe they're they're not lying whatever happened to them both of them on under hypnosis separately to hold the same story\nAnd they they believe whatever they saw happen to them and he said based on that\nTell you they aren't lying to me and uh what an amazing story ...\n... we have to remember that the doctor Simon random facility for three thousand shell shocked war veteran yes called them ...\nFor anybody would get involved and stuff like that\nAnd he had learned to use a ... a means of bringing guys who had terrible experiences you know your buddy said falling off next in battle a that's traumatic but weeks\nAnd so he learned how to handle this and so they were very fortunate and winding up in his hands and you know I I'm Still not sure exactly what he finally thought about the whole business\nBut he surely fill out that these people are not ... that's right they're not looking for attention cetera et cetera I was impressed with ... and uh I was in prison but even born into Barney died young forties and\nUh unfortunately but they they they were ... they had nothing to gain a mixed couple in the United states in the early sixties ...\nWas not parading itself around the world when they were asked to come out so to speak to resist that put a reporter with the story out much to their surprise and relief they retreated fine\nUh and they found out around the world and that's the thing that I have a look I lecture to Nineteen countries and it's given me a pretty good handle on among one of them people and think about the subject of flying saucers aliens or you know ... visitors from someplace else\nAnd I found I just haven't had bad reaction as\nWell and if anything it's getting even stronger I think let's take some calls for instance let's go to a year on in Virginia Beach east of the Rockies go ahead John you're on with stance and Friedman\nStan and like I was taking the the um you know a weird and dance company as a several he is really we've been sending radio signals out of space and um and we behave that way ... any time and ...\nAnd with all the present and then they invade poured it seems to me that a lot on where to take the pet sitting down and said some kind of a plot with uh
