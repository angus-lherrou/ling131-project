right after I got off the air with you last night my smartphone started binging with news alerts it was this launched the two crew members the Russian cosmonauts\nAnd the American astronaut Nick cake are in good health are okay\nThey were heading for the six month mission on the international space station when their flight was boarded their capsules separated and landed about two hundred and fifty miles from their launch site\nMike Farah author of dark missions the secret history of NASA with us why did that was a tense situation but you know what we got to have our own rocketry here in the United states\nWe absolutely do Georgia this just shows how unreliable the Russian hardware really it I mean this is\nAn old do you um space craft and and boosters they've been getting for years they've they've had seven hundred and forty five like they'd had Twenty one failures that that does seem like much but it's three percent and you know you're flying up and the international space station at three percent fail you around your boosters is a is not acceptable because it\nI mean most of the time you do not recovered the crew most of the time of year like this catastrophic\nOh absolutely absolutely you know I still wonder what are we doing on the eye assess the international space station what are they doing up there\nI think we're watching for alien mostly I mean maybe it'll British TV show what would the U.S or where they had space intruder detectors said they called it I think it kind of our version of it I mean I don't I don't know what else are you when they're not doing a whole heck of a lot of science and it\nSeems like we're at the point where either we should just building thing out and expand it and turn it into Babylon five or something or we should

past time for us to make at the\nEnd we were very fortunate that we did not lose the astronaut and the ... not grown absolutely Thanks Mark Mike Berra his website whose name my Barrow B. A. R. A. dot com\nGoal you know imagine if you could buy gold at forty seven hundred dollars and ... goes to four thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that that nothing nothing beach that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on a trip when one of the indicators marketed the last two days is really taking it on the Jim what's the cause for that is it just panic or ... what's happening\nWhat will well two things in and actually they both were laid back to the good old Donald um last week you saw 'em treasury bond yields you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year\nBonds shoot up I'm rather dramatically\nAnd we were predicting this what happened we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to a four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values\nAnd higher or lower it so\nThat was the first thing that happened but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean is this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating and a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh if ...\nI'd a down turn and crash and so so it was rising interest rates\nAnd um and then and more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about for the last month at twenty six forty\nI'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp\nRally for years and has been waiting to go back down and we said look it breaks twenty six forty that that's a sign that China is starting to go down again and it in ... did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and then again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates no the interest rates was the first whack\nThese last two days had a lot more to do with China and Trump is really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways and Trump has been losing the economy would tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff\nAnd that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes grows to go up temporarily and what is the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do is the economy's overheating they raise interest rates if it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous\nAnd and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I created this great thing and the trumps wrecking it no this was predictable he's not you know he's got some you know gut feelings we got to do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences\nOf things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pulled back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose what happened here ... we had a couple more days of downturns me tomorrow if we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people started saying there's something wrong here\nYes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we have a correction like this at the beginning of the year ... market peaked in in late January real kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough\nWe have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent and different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kind of like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nOf what happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay those things over and they start selling insured in the market it happened very quickly\nYou'll see you know I've seen this the last seven\nStock bubbles throughout history everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash and then every other one in the last century including the tech correct in recent bubbles\nThat first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half months and the way people get walk\nAnd that's the sign that that's the only way you know that the bubble\nHas finally birth the problem is by the time that comes people are already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked card so\nWe did the dangers signed as if we keep going down and and and literally I the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just the balance after\nYou know fourteen hundred points and may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers Seventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred twenty five thousand on the ballot\nIf the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets\nAnother steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty fifty four percent like glass crashes can be more like Seventy eighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash will happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make bubbles so dangerous\nUm uh you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross child wants to and then when somebody asks what what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early because that's how his level this is above all this isn't a normal bull market\nThat correct so nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and they crash and and half the time and they crashed twice a is dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of vent and it it the signs to me you're building we've been telling people man this looks like a top here and if it doesn't top here and we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge as we only get a normal ten Fifteen\nPercent or so correction by the end of the year then we're probably good for one more round one more Trump rally into next year before this thing blows but the right now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period\n[noise] what will this is worse because what's happened is that ... we did and we of course we were warning about that George ... decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking\nAnd then in and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries will what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash\nIs we had a big debt bumbling emerging countries and then of course China's been off the charts now for Thirty years and their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like went sideways and didn't the leverage our debt emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up the seat Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and I like I said they have the biggest that Bob ... of anybody in any time in history when China blows or the weird we're going to be worse so so\nMy view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand a two thousand nine recession and the stock crash because they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just build a tub backup with money that was draining this time more debt\nEverything's more stretched the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty\nShe loves absolutely huge and that doesn't mean that companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back ... with us his website is his name Harry Dent D. E. N. T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff the sale of a lifetime\nAnd the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available Dr bone and know Android Gordon I don't want to vote\nWas ... on demand anywhere any time I go to goes to goes to um dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\n\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a Super Bowl I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half\nSix or seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies will not end well which what were the survivors won't companies like apple and Amazon hit upon Amazon there oh my God it was\nYou know like a you know a hundred and fifty dollars it now it's like in a gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies\nAnd you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued an awful like this but they're also go down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world\nSo that's the secret and and the other thing is even at the earnings of companies if companies are so good that they keep their earnings fly instead of declining evaluations on stock how many times earnings white people will pay\nThirty times earnings for the typical stock right now or forty and and sixty or eighty for the best tax on\nThose collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down fifty percent\nEven if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator looking at some of the dangers what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know it's not a secret anymore well I Know I Know\nBelieve me Wall Street won't get this anyway so you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened there the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stopping in and then when things go down there the ones to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors are both were bought in stocks over about they're the ones that short for his\nI mean they're in the know and and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff\nWell they you can measure\nThis action or there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index and what they do is that dumb money ... acts\nIn the morning the first thirty minutes I mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions and the futures markets there ahead of everything and so the market's gonna open down it opens down\nRight at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves to me well that's one of the dumb money and most people would stop just something to protect themselves\nBats when those reactions made that's the money\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit in short it or do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes so they measure this indicator measures but the smart money is doing versus a dumb money and the smart money\nThat has not bought this rally in fact they've been show where they get they been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crap now they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to January top early this year\nBut one sec crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that\nHas been a strong warning signal to me uh in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico now\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went through hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo where it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here\nAnd Michael both of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours and Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blown off all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stop it it's just unbelievable it's it's like can you know God God angry or something you know into through a temper tantrum don't you moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and co labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has ... in ... to islands that are like St Thomas and over or St Croix or St John\nAnd and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there in in I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family for many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move\nSpending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade than it was when I first started coming in and I said to my why don't we moved here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality on a corner of the price of South Beach Miami where we used to live\nAnd and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport which I get to\nTwenty minutes an advanced they only check your id they just wait to see how you're going to ... ... not sure I liked that part well it's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane flight it scenic I'm On I leave my condo doing and landing on this island and one\nHour and once I got down here I realized I could qualify\nFor some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living in the crypto guys are coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualify there's real strong tax advantages so I'm living much cheaper than a man of great climate I can still fly to New York\nIn four hours director Miami and two hours and then almost anywhere in the east coast is now it's difficult if I'm coming out your way if I'd have to go out to California which I just did for a long time that that the long haul now but I tell ya I I like it down here they've been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years\nWe're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent here and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next so many years\nThe big banks down there\n[noise] yeah yeah yeah about in in in Schwab down here and actually a lot of the banks are buying banker popular in Santander are Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but they there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service\nSo people either just because they think we're in Zimbabwe or they charge some huge X and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like yeah but otherwise man this is a good deal and\nYou know I'm Down here for other reasons but I tell you people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower\nThey vote in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that that they are allowed to vote in our elections\nWill most important they are allowed to freely move for immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education or the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and have much better job opportunities and then when they get older and have kids I guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico to put their kids\nTo colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then sometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving\nTo the United states why sixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants from Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people ... ...\nSides and the government decides in the U.S is better to help create good jobs down here to tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized Puerto Rico because the U.S as always always rubbing their best\nPeople and again it it's they're more professional educated people that are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\nSo I Want you to give us your best impressions on what you think will happen economically over the next year this country seems to be mired right now ... in a conflict\nEmotion it's unbelievable I've never seen it this way yeah and I think it's going to affect the economy one\nDay it does is another reason I'm kind of happy to be here and watch what's going on this was a major theme for the first time in his ear oh our book\nThat they were not just seeing a major boom peak globally and a major bobble and debt bubbles and all this de leveraging it and

... what what was his point [noise]\n[noise] yeah well he well he's saying that the you know the the RED People don't like that these are people are going to vote blue and we got this blue red war so when they see Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester well we don't like him that he said they're not as high skilled while I'm telling you in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically\nA reinvigorated Orlando there's four ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando and a million\nIn Florida and those million which which she is right about or tilting devote all all the key Senate races up and guess who they're appealing to those Puerto Ricans the Republican and the Democrats Rick Scott and Bill Nelson running for Senate in their boat courting the Puerto Ricans 'cause they're five percent of the vote and that's enough to swing an election\nAnd they do is that what you have a crack addict isn't that what our democracy ...\nYes it is it is\nLet's go to Greg in New Jersey taken away Gregory\nRight yes my question George in the morning I just like to say I live in a congressional districts in northern New Jersey\nWe kept thirty percent of our federal tax dollars back but blue states subsidize the red states and the and the state the receipt for most of Kentucky with an idiot McConnell was I'm a destroys me nuts and it's been like this for fifty years we subsidize the south in the southwest the northeast those until the mid west\n... for your guest I've been reading the Financial Times for many years and what you're saying is has a column every week scaring the heck out of all of us with with what you're saying\n... will be closer to home I'm about four years from retirement and for like thirty five years almost forty years are entity which was nationwide but some through New York [noise]\nOur pension was over from the late nineties it took a horrendous hit with this time the tech stocks and then in two thousand they almost could obliterate his got wiped out we have a meeting novel thousands of is about to retire right all high\nYeah and I don't trust any body on Wall street I think there should be ... team set up there if you will again and I'm pregnant rose bushes should come down from heaven and come back but the thing is what we ask our financial\nPeople who are running our pension fund put their fancy suits what are they doing to dissipate this problem I'll take your answer off the air\nYou know real quick they they used to ... not only the stock market starts collapsing everybody's been driven end of the stock market\nBecause quantitative easing in monetary policy's push down long term rates that you can get on safer investments like treasury bonds and corporate bonds and things like that which pension plan should be more in but\nBut you can't get your seven to eight percent returns they used to get with a conservative combination of stocks and bonds so everybody's gone more stocks and then stock start collapsing\nThan they are in trouble the truth is as much as it's counterintuitive a pension plan today the best thing you can do what we're telling people right now this this break up and ... is going to make bombs\nOr corporate bonds and treasury bonds long term more attractive if that thirty year treasury bond goes up to four point three percent we're telling our subscribers this is likely to happen in the next several months for the next year at the most\nYou're going to want to lock those and not only to get a four point three percent return on his way better than almost any stock that evidence but those bonds will appreciate when stocks collapse and the economy slows down\nAn interest rates go down bonds like falling interest rates are right now is not the time to buy these bonds but there is going to be a huge opportunity for investors\nAnd pension funds to lock in quality bonds it's only the quality bonds that did well in the great depression triple a corporate\nTen and thirty year treasury bond lock in those things for appreciation and for higher yields and don't be in stocks the worst place to be for pension plan is to do what everybody's that run into stocks and collapse and you also write about blue states subsidizing read\nThat's why I think this time around it's going to be the blue states that succeed against red policies that they don't agree with but most of all they're like okay see what happens to your red economy when New York and California when the north east and west coasts succeed from the union and they'd be would it would be a problem\nLet's go to Thomas in the California Hey Tom go ahead hey George thank you for taking my call sir Harry your research is really appreciated\nUm [noise] I Need you know you brought up earlier that a corollary to depressions and major recessions in war and\nYou could argue that the world today is in a third world war that's a proxy war you know in places like Syria yeah I'm In the south China Sea et cetera and\nWhen global corporations cannot\nCompromise their differences in the global boardrooms\nThere was a shooting war just like World War one world war two Korea\nVietnam and on and on so\nI don't think I mean a limited nuclear exchange could turn the United states and to a third world country in a day or two you know with a electromagnetic pulse and ... what is the probability of a shooting more\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan hum that but but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade global trade\nIt collapsed sixty percent\nBetween World War one and World War two with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising tariffs just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happening this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole every body loses or at least most countries loose\nAnd and that's what's happening now this trade war with China what ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea that could definitely be stopped there there's no question\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody is big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have is there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one somebody hit us they would be dead long before we watch so I think that's\nKind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds Mitt Nineteen hundreds no there were major countervailing power is how you could have war one or two but we're going to definitely have\nA political huge political jeez this trade war we said it's zero hour before this became obvious this is going to last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and there there could be some physical war but there is certainly

E. R. dot com [noise]\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast with Harry Dent junior his website Harry Dent dot com linked up the coast to coast am dot com and as we get into the final calls here Harry thank you again for the amazing information you're always give us\n[noise] yup love the reach of people George ... people need to hear this\nJason in Portland, Oregon welcome to the program Jason go ahead\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market at the new sector and has to do with a\nAnd I happened to it in mid July just before the infusion and the canopy growth but the average company which happened to be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually ... in value\nUm about fifty thousand up two hundred thousand portfolio but my question is would you um would this kind of be offered a little bit particularly and kill the ... election this November because\nThere are several states that are looking you then have it on the ballot and if they legalize usually when that happens there is a kind of an upswing or would you pull out of that now because of this danger of what you're talking about taking place\nOr you know that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend and even block chain and crypto currency is our but\nAll of these industries above all these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly when we have a down turn because first of all everything gets hit but the the the strongest sectors get hit the most because they bubble up the most and people don't understand that\nSame with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most and history has shown that so\nYou do have I mean I I Would say in this case you know you may want to hold on just for the election and favors a pop but yeah I Do think center in such a hot sector take your games see what happens the next few\nYears especially the next year is going to be critical and then you know if things crash that is a good sector to get back into this\nIs a long term social political turn and it's going to go in that direction although there may be some backlash in the downturn just because people get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good actor but yes I I don't want to be an actor\nWhen it when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people and there's a lot of people say well this sector all do All right because I went and the great depression than tire thirties and look for one any major sector toilet paper\nUm utilities movies you know boom you know things that people would maybe use more in a downturn and and because of that collapse\nThe the high quality bonds that so yeah take your games you know again and your case I might just see these elections pop and then then go the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but there is danger there you're right about that\nPeriod when they when the bottom falls out how do you know which hit the bottom oh your ... how do you know when the pop back in\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at pass corrections I mean everything's different this is not like you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine correct and it's not like the seventies corrections stock corrections back then were fifty percent\nThat's more typical this is more like these great resets\nEven a de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets which of course stock as are the leading ones when that happened is Seventy percent is kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed eighty nine percent for the ... eighty nine percent so\nI'm looking for levels like that I think my range is Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start\nLooking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now is that thirty year treasury bond which is a been a three point four percent recently that gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I started by even though that's the best thing in the downturn\nIt's too early to buy that right now if you're going to park their money just being save\nShort term bonds and CDs and T bills and stopped to preserve your money next step is moving the long term quality bonds and then and and and the sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities so I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like\nLike like like marijuana and pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam dunk winter long term [noise] wait for the ... you may get to buy into that a little earlier than something like you know home builders\nNonstop Allen isn't put do Kentucky first time caller for cello Alan\nHey George a lot of the show you Sacramento\nCorrect me if I'm wrong here but red states are Republican yeah OK stature Democrat or a Democrat or make then they do not signing earner did I miss I understand you've made you said the south was read during the civil war\nYes they they would have been they would have been more even though\nKnow they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party in the south and help get Nixon elected through southern voters\nAnd that's a whole different party he had to convince a lot of democratic politician some senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so\nThe Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read is Republican\nBlue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now if you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor the Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans Hoover coming into that\nWhen things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people there that you know the Democratic go to the Democrats\nIn a downturn in a book in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are our long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican area here\nAnd you know the blue people are gonna like the the rich people won't but all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPartisan and my work Republicans are always going to be here Democrats as it's a play of opposites that's just as important as men and women and booms in Boston inflation and deflation and every other play of opposite\nAnd it goes back and forth the same thing the west has dominated the world uh since since uh the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century is going to be the east and that's another trend and we can clearly show to cycle so so what we do\nIs just show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation\nThis country that country blue ... I mean we can do all this stuff in the long term is surprisingly predictable\nAnd that's where Congress get it wrong comments think the short term predictable I'm guessing when I tell you I think this thing's gonna top no or so many months from now I'm making an educated guess that may make me sixty Seventy percent right but never hundred when I told told people Twenty years ago baby boomers going to peak in two thousand seven\nIn the economy was going to slow down and his ears that was not a gas that science of when people predict money just as accurate it wasn't life insurance actuaries will tell people when they die collectively\n... go to Gordon them Lakeland, Florida in the wild card line endured and by the way next next week we're doing a show on student loans\nOh wow what a coincidence\nNow any yeah George and Harry thanks for taking my call my traditional I'm reading your intro\nNow first off I'm rolling conservative if you put in if you ask a girl who's this Gordon over in Lakeland, Florida that last for three decision on the side of the thing I I did better than Jeb Bush it'll find me it'll tell you my last name I'm not going to tell them to you I'm pro gun pro gun rights fiscally conservative\nSo when I say that they both ... than liberal the Democrats and the Republicans have taxed\nStudents to death with college tuition and not done anything both parties are bad and voters in both parties don't want to be over tax tuition is a form of tax money go into an arm of the government both political um both the Democrat and Republican voters want their second the minute ride\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] from riverside Chevrolet Master control center says is W.

E. R. dot com\n[noise]\n\nAnd won't go back to coast to coast with Harry Dent junior his website Harry Dent dot com linked up at coast to coast am dot com and as we get into the final calls here Harry thank you again for the amazing information you're always give us\nThe reach of people George ... people need to hear this\nJason in Portland, Oregon welcome to the program Jason go ahead\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market at the new secular and has to do with our thoughts and I happened to it in mid July just before the huge and in the end of the growth but the average company\nWhich happened to be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually downloaded and value\nUm about fifty thousand up two hundred thousand portfolio but my question is what you would this kind of been offered a little bit particularly and fill the election this November because\nThere are several states that are looking you then have it on the ballot and if they legalize usually when that happens there is a an an upswing or would you pull out of that now because of this age you're of a what you're talking about taking place\nOr you know yeah that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend uneven block chain and crypto currency is our but\nAll of these industries above all these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly when we have a downturn 'cause fruitful everything gets hit\nBut the the the strongest sectors get hit the most because they bubble up the most and people don't understand that same with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most and history has shown that so\nYou do have I mean I I Would say in this case you may want to hold on just for the election of favors a pop but yes I Do think center in such a hot factor take care\nIt says specially the next year is going to be critical and then yeah it things crash that is a good sector to get back into this\nIs a long term social political trend it's gonna go in that direction although there may be some backlash and the downturn just because people get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good actor but yes I I don't want to be an actor\nWhen when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people and there's a lot of people say well this sector will do All right because I went and the great depression than tire thirties and look for one any major sector toilet paper\nUm utilities movies you know boos you know things that people would maybe use more than a downturn\nAnd and because of that collapse and valuations and that fear factor everything went down I couldn't find anything any major stock sector that made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bonds that so yeah take your games\nYou know again in your case I might just see these elections pop and then\nGo the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but\nThere is danger there you're right about that\nPeriod when they when the bottom falls out hunting you know which hit the bottom ... how do you know when the pop back in\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at pass corrections that I mean everything's different this is not like you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine correct and it's not like the seventies correction stock corrections back then were fifty percent\nThat's more typical this is more like these great resets\n... de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets which of course stock as are the leading ones when that happened is Seventy percent is kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed eighty nine percent for the Dow eighty nine percent so\nI'm looking for levels like that I think my range is Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start\nLooking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now if that thirty year treasury bond which has been a three point four percent recently\nIf that gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I started by even though that's the best thing in the downturn it's too early to buy that right now if you're going to park you might just be unsafe\nShort term bonds and CDs and T bills and stopped to preserve your money next step is moving the long term quality bonds and then\nAnd and and the sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities\nSo I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like marijuana and pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam dunk winter long term [noise] wait for the ... you may get to buy into that a little earlier than something like you know home builders\nNonstop Allen isn't put do go to the first time caller for cello Allen\nGeorge a lot of the show you Sacramento\nCorrect me if I'm wrong here but red states are Republican yeah OK stature Democrat or a Democrat or make then they do not signing earner did I miss I understand you've made you said the south was read during the\nCivil war yes they they would have been they would have been more even though\nKnow they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party in the south and help get Nixon elected through southern voters\nA lot of democratic politicians and senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so\nThe Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read is Republican\nBlue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now if you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor the Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans who were coming into that\nWhen things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people there that you know the ... they go to the Democrats\nIn a downturn in a book in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are\nOur long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican area here to a democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people going like that the rich people won't but all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPartisan and my work Republicans are always going to be here Democrats as it's a play of opposites that's just as important as men and women and booms and Boston inflation and deflation and every other play of opposite\nAnd it goes back and forth the same thing the west has dominated the world uh since since the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's gonna be the east\nAnd that's another trend and we can clearly show through cycles so so what we do\nIs just show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation\nThis country that country blue red I mean we can do all this stuff in the long term is surprisingly predictable\nAnd that's where a condom is get it wrong condoms think the short term predictable I'm guessing when I tell you I think this thing's gonna top no or so many months from now I'm making an educated guess that may make me sixty to Seventy percent right but never hundred when I told told people Twenty years ago baby boomers are going to peak in two thousand seven\nIn the economy was going to slow down and his ears that was not I guess that's science of when people predict money just as accurate it wasn't life insurance actuaries will tell people when they die collectively\nThat something will go to Gordon them Lakeland, Florida in the wild card line in ... and by the way next a next week we're doing a show on student loans\nOh wow what a coincidence\nNow any yeah George and Harry thanks for taking my call my traditional I'm reading your intro\nNow first off I'm a ... conservative if you put in if you ask a girl who's this Gordon over in Lakeland, Florida that lost a foreigner three decision on the side of the thing I I did better than Jeb Bush it'll find the it'll tell you my last name I'm not going to tell them to you I'm pro gun pro gun rights fiscally conservative\nSo when I say that they both ... liberal the Democrats and the Republicans have taxed\nStudents to death with college tuition and not done anything both parties are bad and voters in both parties don't want to be over tax tuition is a form of tax money go into an arm of the government both political um both the Democrat and Republican voters want their second the minute rides", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year":
