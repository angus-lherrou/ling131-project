... of the Lebanese a heritage and I'm very familiar with that\nTore blown the country now be used to be the jewel of the middle east it isn't anymore Fred is it\n[noise] no I'm afraid not a George ah we've watched it deteriorate for several years now and of course a Hezbollah has become a very strong and country and a operates as an Iranian proxy\nAnd uh how long Samuel has this been going on with Iran backing Hezbollah and who are the are these Lebanese people or are they a rainy and who are they\nAll have the Lebanese\nReligious militia um\nUnderground Iranian proxy groups that were formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of living on in Nineteen eighty two\nUm Lebanon is is you know was always split between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiite populations for domination of the country and the sheer were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy one of the Shiite spiritual leaders hum of murder to Libya and left the vacuum in the country and and that coincided with the onset of\nAyatollah Khomeini and Iran and the Iranian Revolution and thinks of uranium for a possible fertile ground to spread the revolution in Lebanon and they sent him a series of they send some intelligence specialist somebody sent revolutionary guards men\nTo Lebanon with serious blessing and they set up a little bit on and they established almost a mini state within in many states that was very obvious to many\nIn front of the country um for them I interviewed a few people\nWho are journalists at the time in Lebanon and they said that the Iranian influence was everywhere um sadly the the two people of the two groups that neglected this this arrival and the amount of money in the amount of influence with the Iranians were spreading a little bit on\nOr the Israelis and the Americans to people that had a vested interest in keeping 'em the Iranians way out of Lebanon\nFor any is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as al ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative a statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than\nThan any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on\nUS embassies and the hijackings in the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which uh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of history\nA this has never been done this was an organization that had\nA literally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild a all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing\nUh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um\nIt it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred um but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because uh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley\nUm we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us\nExactly where he was so um [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and uh but I Know that there was a heck of a heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nWho never get in that story or want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty is Wilfrid ... what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east\nIt's not here in the United states why do I have to even worry about this what do you tell them [noise]\nIt only look back on the events of nine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and the plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region or why we need a footprint\nUh in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy a and a a take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil\nAnd uh that's the the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nOr we're going to talk about William Buckley here and just a moment we're with Fred Burton Samuel Katz ... book is called the babe Ruth rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them on what truly is\nA very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized and hopefully Fred than Samuel with your book the rules you're getting more and more exposure\nTo what's happening over there and if you can say I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break give us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um the has the forces have been fighting from the onset alongside rainy and special forces to help keep 'em president off of um regime in power\nUm has ... has been transformed from an underground fourth\nI'm In the Nineteen eighties the period where for them I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um the fundamentalist suicide Shiite brands of terrorism\nAnd it has emerged into probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm is it for the United states in Iraq\nIt was um it was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq\nDevelop their um I eat these um strategy and tactics that killed so many American servicemen I'm In ... launched a um ... war against Israel where I'm laid siege to a movie of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities\nUm it does involve the narco terrorism is one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm I'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has if we ... them operatives in this country has for many years\nAnd it is an arm and extension of Iran of um of desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important in the U.S national interest\nAll countries of course work through straw parties we worked with Osama bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets out of there\nGiving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah but why are we getting tough with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stop supplying them or we're going to one night like why don't we do that Sam\nI I think that this country has been very apprehensive about engaging Iran militarily\nAre hostages were seized with the U.S embassy in Tehran I'm a many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war but Iran has like in the United states\nThe bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of marine barracks which was um on the thirty five years ago\nBack to this point and we'll talk with you a threat as well about your book Babe Ruth rules next on coast to coast study you know\nWe're never missed a detail of the show or a gift to sign up for the coastal zone email newsletter available for free at coast to coast am dot com\nWelcome back to coast to coast Fred Burton with us Samuel Katz their book is called bay rude rules Sam you were mentioning of course that a Hezbollah may have sleeper cells in the United states is that possibly one reason we haven't gone after Iran militarily and attack them because we're afraid that those cells could be activated\nNo I don't think so I think um we haven't gone after Iran militarily because we're not really sure or a direct military conflict with Iran might bring I think the Iranian you of groups like Hezbollah\nTo export terrorism throughout the middle east and the rest of the world is going for um policy planners in this country\nFor generations it was um directly responsible for a lack of response to it with a truck bombing of empathy Murray in ... and the kidnapping of a station chief\nFrom things that was unheard of in the world ... up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only\nStation she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped\nAnd tell us about William Buckley\n[noise] a bill was a a a true patriot Georgia he grew up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening this is not the journalists were talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA ... and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years wrote them and uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and a thought about a casting them but I'm\nA bill grow up in the Boston area a seminar we're lucky enough to uh get the cooperation of bills a family has a elderly companion or that he's lived with for many many years and a sister\nWho just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh\nI'm In he went off after high school went to the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea\nAs a young kid and um where he was a silver star recipient and are\nAlso a Purple Heart I'm an which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into\nWhen he comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties says it was very murky or as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that could tell us specifically what he was up to\nA but regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things when you know it didn't surprise me because of uh the nature of it as a curiosity and his languages and ability to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history uh so uh in Nineteen sixty or he joins or the U.S army again\nA and goes under special forces a and I'm also a associated with the CIA and that time period a he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter and recruiter and um the goes off or\nTo Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star for courage under fire\nA so this was a man George that was always running towards danger and uh he he reminds me of the NYPD a cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers\nUp you know you know they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off a bill or was uh uh the only guy to raise his hand to volunteer to go to be rude or at the CIA\nUh after this devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station is wiped out so um that was to Bill Buckley was a and he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Beirut clandestine or was it ... forty well known by people\nWell ah the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the or the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that to\nSuch as the Jordanians the French the Israel and so forth so I'm Bill is not in a undercover\nDo do well uh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um\nYou know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meat snitches uh and so forth and so um you know bill was that kind of person\nAnd I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day a in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles and Hezbollah grabs them and um they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't you have security around\n[noise] it's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period a it was an unusual for a station chief not to have security uh salmon I did our last book on bin ... uh where you had a whole Qadri a professional uh\nSecurity personnel to specifically watch a CIA officers backs\nAre in that time period are they really didn't exist you could request security it could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but uh you can't really do your job is a is a secret agent to use that phrase\nIt with an entourage so ah the nature of the job and that and that time period was a you're a single ... a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally killed him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and\nUm I was part of the hostage de briefing team where uh we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man I spoke to him in ... and visa button Germany after he had been held in captivity\nAnd and he told his bill had died and that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because you know um we had devoted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so [noise]\nUh then it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWill must have been like looking for a needle in a haystack for ...\nOh my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was not time period um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a person in a building or in a very barracks\nUm and we literally could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating [noise]\nUh I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was a at one point\nOr the FBI believed that uh through through their source network the bill had actually been flown to Tehran a and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut while I'm which I'm\nNot you certainly a smoking gun or as to who was directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam ... let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time ...\nAnd it simply saying he was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think ... call them accurate or not\nI think it's fairly safe to assume that under torture\nI'm Bill Buckley um revealed information I'm a very classified nature I'm as station chief um he was the supervisor he was the um the branch manager of the ... the U.S intelligence apparatus in Lebanon\nSo he knew the names of the other agents he knew the names of their sources and he had all that information I'm In his in his mind because he had to control it on a daily basis that he has to supervise it I'm One of the um [noise]\nIn one of the things that we reveal in the book is shortly after

it's it's it's this idea that ... and it's been bouncing around for years is that you know we as the you know the population of this planet won't be able to handle the truth that there may be you know being some other worlds are out there and maybe visiting\nSomeone gave him a very detailed photographs of what they called to fight as back then but the UFOs\nAnd he did not want that released to the public relations\nYeah that's right because he thought all religion would fail that that was histories and all that you know while religion based you know we're based in if we find out that you know we're not the only ones in the universe it puts some new questions on um a lot of the major religions so you\nKnow can we not handle it I don't believe that I think they were the vast majority of people on this or I Want to know what's going on and what we'd like to know that there are other being's out there you know it's one at once again it would be like the greatest story in and all of

you know to spend it if you\nTalk about these things I Know my own family we're told this thing\nKind of you know amnesty for these people you know they have the Pentagon say okay if anyone was

about their experiences [noise]\nIt'll maybe someday that would happen or who knows but we do hear that story over and over the top of the very odd happened to people during the military service having to do with your opposed and they were basically threatened did not talking about\nYou know the old men in black situation ... did you come across anything like that you work\n[noise] well you know once again just so many stories you know the fifties and sixties and you know you ... is actually two kinds of men in black as it turns out they were there were some who\nDon't even from

look like us they written\nBat hitting you know black clothes but then there are other people who said the men in black and and now obviously some kind of you know from some kind of intelligence\nUnit

I'm afraid not a George ah we've watched it deteriorate for several years now and of course a Hezbollah has become a very strong and country and a operates as an Iranian proxy\nAnd how long Samuel has this been going on with Iran backing Hezbollah and who are the are these Lebanese people or the Iranians who are they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God the Shiite religious militia [noise]\nUm [noise] oh\nIranian proxy group that\nThe invasion of urban on in Nineteen eighty two um Lebanon is is you know was always split between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiite populations for domination of the country and the sheer were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy one of the Shiite spiritual leaders hum we've was murdered in Libya and lift the vacuum in the country and and that coincided with the onset of\nAyatollah Khomeini and Iran and the Iranian Revolution and the ... of the uranium for a possible fertile ground to spur the revolution in\nLebanon and they sent him a series of the sun so intelligent specialists and they sent revolutionary guard going\nTo have been on with Syria's blessing and they set up bases loaded on and they established almost a mini state within in many states that was very obvious to many\nIn front of the country for them I interviewed a few people\nWho are journalists the crime in Lebanon and they said that the Iranian influence was everywhere um family the the two people of the two groups neglected this this arrival and the amount of money in the amount of influence with the Iranians were spreading it a little bit on\nOr the Israelis and the Americans to people that have a vested interest in keeping 'em the Iranians way out of Lebanon\nFriend is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as al ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative a statement to before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than\nThan any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on\nThe u._s. embassies and the hijackings in the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which uh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of some history\nOr does it never been done this was an organization that had\nA literally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild\nA all the intelligence operations after the first us embassy bombing uh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um\nIt it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred uh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because uh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley\nUm we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us\nExactly where he was so um [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a\nOf history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and um but I Know that there was a heck whole heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nWas ever get into that story or want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty is Wilfrid ... what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question or you can only look back on the events of nine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers\nIt's a van certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of\nWe have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region why we need a footprint or in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy a and a a take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil\nAnd uh that's the the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nOr we're going to talk about William Buckley here in just a moment we're with Fred Burton Samuel Katz ... book is called the babe Ruth rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them on what truly is\nA very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized and hopefully Fred than Samuel with your book the rules you're getting more and more exposure\nTo what's happening over there and if you can say I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break give us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um the the his forces have been fighting from the onset along fine Iranian special forces to help keep I'm president of of um regime in power has ... has been transformed from an underground for\n'em in the Nineteen eighties the period we're for them I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um the fundamentalist suicide Shiite brands of terrorism and it has emerged into probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm is it is for the United states in Iraq it was it was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq developed there um I ... I'm strategies and tactics that killed so many American servicemen I'm into the ... launched\nA um ... Oregon Israel where I'm laid siege um we've indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities\nUm it does involve the narco terrorism is one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm I'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with that we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has if we were so them operatives in this country has for many years\nAnd it is an arm and extension of Iran of um\nOf desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important in the U.S national interest\nAll countries of course work through straw parties we worked with Osama bin Laden and the movies or hygiene in Afghanistan to get the Soviets out of there\nGiving them cash in arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah but why are we getting tough with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stop supplying them or we're gonna one night like why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive about engaging Iran militarily\nAre hostages were seized with the U.S embassy in Tehran um many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war by Iran and Hezbollah against the United states\nThe bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of marine barracks which was um thirty five years ago to this day\nOn hold on for a second sample come back to this point and we'll talk with you in\nStunk coast to coast I never missed a detail on a show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at coast to coast am dot com\nWelcome back to coast to coast Fred Burton with us Samuel Katz their book is called Babe Ruth rules Sam you were mentioning of course that a Hezbollah may have sleeper cells in the United states is that possibly one reason we haven't gone after Iran militarily and attack them because we're afraid that those cells could be activated\nNo I don't think so I think um we haven't gone after Iran militarily because we're not really sure or a direct military conflict with Iran might bring I think the Iranian youth groups like Hezbollah\nTo export terrorism throughout the middle east and the rest of the world is don't take enough for 'em policy planners in this country\nFor generations it was um directly responsible for a lack of response to it with a truck bombing of the marine and the kidnapping of a station chief\nFrom things that was unheard of in the world ... up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only\nStation is she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of Asia\nFor Burton tell us about William Buckley\nThe patriots Georgia he grew up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening this is not the journalists were talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA I and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years I wrote them\nAnd uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and a thought about a casting them but I'm a bill grow up in the Boston area a seminar we're lucky enough to uh get the cooperation of bills or family has a elderly companion or that he's lived with for many many years and a sister\nWho just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh\nI'm In he went off after high school went to the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea\nAs a young kid and um where he was a silver star recipient and are also a Purple Heart I'm an which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division were built first enlisted into\nWhen he comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties says it was very murky a as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that could tell us specifically what he was up to\nA but regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things when you know didn't surprise me because of uh the nature of it as a curiosity and his languages ability to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history uh so uh in Nineteen sixty or he joins or the U.S army again\nA and goes under special forces are and I'm also a associated with the CIA and that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter and recruiter and um little goes off or\nTo Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire a so this was a man George that was always running towards danger and uh\nHe he reminds me of the NYPD a cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers\nUp you know you're known for years they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um\nAnd and off a bill or was uh uh the only guy to raise his hand to to volunteer to go to be rude or at the CIA\nUh after this devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station is wiped out so um that was who Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nAnd that was his assignments bread in Bay roots clandestine or was it pretty well known by people\nWell ah the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the or the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that to\nSuch as the Jordanians the French the Israel and so forth so I'm Still is not in a undercover position during that time period\nSomebody read it on him no doubt\nStay rooted in that time period um you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meat snitches uh and so forth and so um you know bill was that kind of person\nAnd I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day a in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles\nAnd Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't you have security around it\n[noise] it's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period a it was an unusual for station chiefs not to have security or the same and I did our last book on bin ... uh where you had a whole Qadri a professional\nUh security personnel to specifically watch a CIA officers backs\nAre in that time period um they really didn't exist you could request security it could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but uh you can't really do your job is a is a secret agent to use that phrase\nIt with an entourage so ah the nature of the job and that and that time period was you were a single ... or a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally killed him\n[noise] he was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and\nUm I was part of the hostage de briefing team where uh we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin ... came out to who was a wonderful man I spoke to him and ... ... visas button Germany after he had been held in captivity\nAnd and he told his bill had died and that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because we had voted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so [noise]\nUh then it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWell must have been like looking for a needle in a haystack for at home\nOn my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was a time period um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a person in a building or in a very barracks\nI'm ... and we literally could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating [noise] uh I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believe that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran a and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut while I'm which I'm\nThat's you certainly a smoking gun or as to who was directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam ... let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak Anderson wrote an article about ... William Buckley ... simply saying he was tortured\nAnd I just left the man's name by any means but where do you think jak Anderson's call them accurate or not\nI I think it's fairly safe to assume that under torture\nI'm Bill Buckley um revealed information I'm a very classified nature I'm as station chief um he was the supervisor he was the um the branch manager of the ... the U.S intelligence apparatus in Lebanon\nSo he knew the names of the other agents he knew the names of their sources and he had all that information I'm In his in his mind because he had to control it on a daily basis that he has to supervise it I'm One of the um\nIn one of the things that we reveal in the book is shortly after bill was um confirmed that he was\nAt lower your monthly payment say yes to a as the there your goals and the as your credit union federally insured by and the UAE equal opportunity from\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control centers visit W.

red bird than Samuel Katz their work is going to be rude rules are website linked linked up at ... dot com for I don't want to get your take on these are multi ... situation of course and\nOf course the Saudi royals lied about the case or in the beginning a truly was killed at the consulate butchered uh yeah I guess because of what his uh his writings were about the royal family and about Saudi Arabia or but she's my gosh what's your take on that\n[noise] goodness Georgia I can never remember another incident like that on a diplomatic a facility in the history of time uh now I'm sure the Russians live possibly ah\nAh disposed of some bodies via similar methods so we're just not aware of just knowing how the KGB operates in this arena but ah I just uh I cannot imagine how a this operation was put put together a to actually do this or\nInside a diplomatic facility\nOr with all the eyes and ears that are on every diplomatic facility in the world are you certainly could could have thought of a a a much better operation and and\nSo ah either it was done with the purposeful intent to resonate uh although it or how it appears that this just was a a a tremendous fiasco and uh I I certainly don't think we've seen the last of this now that curious part to George with this is\nA based on some of the research we've done here at strapped for a there appears to then a few other ah Saudi princes that have disappeared too so I'm\n... since the royal prince basically took over\nA correct a and before this incident uh and ... so\nUh this just might be part and parcel to ah Saudi a outreach and covert action a to a target and eliminate a dissidents or any enemies of a of the royal family but uh uh it's certainly an unprecedented a mess\nBecause when he came in with his daughter base when his father basically said hey you're going to be in charge here uh didn't he put a lot of boils away at the Ritz Carlton are in Riyadh and basically held them as hostage\nOr if he did and you know you get back to a you know the the CIA director uh is en route or or just arrived there for meeting or\nA which is always very interesting because those meetings never happened in a vacuum or I Would not be surprised to see a some sort of a a\nEffort behind the scenes to to try to make sense of what took place and and to move forward or you know that's the other interesting thing and these kinds of cases George you know behind\nJust go about their business and um because you know the the world doesn't shut down with threats with liaison work and uh and the curious part there is to do the Saudis ah for all their dysfunction and chaos ah there's still a an intelligence provider\n... that that gets funneled into the to the big intelligence community so uh it it it certainly is a a fiasco though\nIt's like a partnership with a double isn't it\nWell most relationships with governments are a few times\nA I'm a front side to say and it's just the nature of the business uh you know some of rock along steadily without uh any hiccups like with our five eyes relationships um but you know those stone at times working smoothly as a as most people think\nAh because remember a you know there are no friendly intelligence services so that's the one ... that you learn and and basic age in school\nIs a there are no friendly intelligence services in each nation state is going to operate and what they feel is the best ... served their country\nAnd ... Lee was the nephew of the late Saudi arms dealer a non ... uh there was so the you know there's been this power group within the royal family for years what what did he right that was so devastating that they want to kill him over\nWell that's the fascinating part I was talking to a couple of our ah Saudi analysts this morning here in the office and uh one of the analysts actually had a went in and watched him at a local speaking event\nUh this is an individual that are really wasn't that high profile ah and you probably could have lifted you know a dozen others that are more vocal against\nThe ... I mean he's more well known now dead and then he was alive\nWell exactly and you know was at one of these cases where are you know you look at what the Russian what putting in the KGB did going into the u._k. and and taking out scribe Paul when ... you know the poisoning or you know so uh you know do do these intelligence services see these\nA nation state moves like this\nAnd say well heck why can't we do this too\nI I mean it might boiled down to being something as simple as that\nYeah it's crazy and Fifteen people and apparently they're going to war ... most of them which is interesting because of the big are they going to rat on the person who said get this done for me and I think we all know words leading a or are they going to keep quiet and the hope that they get leniency and get out of prison in a year or two\nWell when you don't want to be in a Turkish prison that's that's the one given\nYou know that's true too that's true to Tom in the Bronx it'll it's going to start at Tom go ahead\nI like to say that their leaders are horrendous caper is Yemen\nI mean it gives the United states very ugly face and name and how can you uh how can it be said that they want peace between Israel and the Palestinians\nWhen they have this when they have these terrible stories going on one\nFor another if I were in charge I Would say well maybe you can take ... and make it a temporary of God when the of the was not for oil and that would go much for silver but for the sake of humanity to stop\nThe game as from a\nSending missiles into Israel and Israel bombing guys do at least stabilize that\nThe uh aspect to the story they ... they took I they they took Libya and they made him ... to Libya\nAnd in the ... that they should go back there and retake the area in the creative same government for the Libyans\nI well I think they tried that Tom but it's just failed miserably so far printing Sam you of course wrote books on Benghazi that horrible situation there\nA coffee of course was no Boy Scout we hated the guy he was a terrorist and all of a sudden after Reagan bombed them killed is one of his wives and a little kid or he went straight gave up his nukes and his new planning and everything else what do you think of that whole situation for it\n[noise] well uh first uh you know the state department has a long history of tragedy I've I've lived through a lot uh and uh you look at ... I I'm a you know they they have done a tremendous course correction or the organization my own outfit is hired more agents\nAh they've they've now train they now train and protect with buildings on fire\nUh they've worked with empty and why to the villa protocols for that as an agent or I was never trained at the state department or as to how to do that in a smoke filled environment so there's been a lot of lessons learned in a lot of changes made in protection\nA ... he was a mess I I mean ... Stevens never should have been there on September the eleventh\nOr as the chief of mission of the president's representative to to Libya uh they pretty much can do what they want and he decided he wanted to go and he was there and he shouldn't have been and um the agents got overwhelmed and you know certainly the\nThe CIA um security support team were heroes you know they came and uh and and got everybody out of the special mission compound there but uh\nUm it's just a a another long list of disasters that has happened and and [noise] um let's let's hope that we don't see any more on the horizon\nHow many Libyans storm our embassy\nUm than do you recall the exact number I I don't remember off the top of my head there were very very poor\n... a retired between sixty and I'm a couple of hundred um or", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Coosada", "day": "24"}
