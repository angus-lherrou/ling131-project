Saturday\n[noise] everybody puts get started [noise] listen to me [noise]\nEverybody wants the gift that keeps on giving that special gift\nOne that you don't put in a drawer and forget about you know it's it's the one gift that you can visit or use every single day and tomorrow and the day after that\nAnd for that singular perfect present that's all wrapped up in a boat for this planet\nAnd every one on it it's the great pyramid of Egypt you don't have to look at any further [noise] it is the gift that keeps on giving the great pyramid\nIs forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly leveled and rock pointing exactly true north south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years allegedly\nAnd yet we know nothing about it a few\nShort decades after Cleopatra's rain a sparrow any knowledge of the great pyramid any troops into history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read ... nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they would travel to Cairo they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that\nYou know and the answer air quotes\nWe don't know you know but it's really big [laughter] that's that's it it took nearly Eighteen hundred years\nTo figure out the language and he would think that was all of the expedition to Egypt over the centuries that someone some time somewhere where they have shown up who knew how to read write or speak\nAnd then ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the vine mystery by Robert Duvall and that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the Germans were aligned with the stars and it's just that that just kind of open something up\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more and uh and then a couple of years ago is when you're really took off um and and then I said I had some you know I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and I've met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise\nAnd uh and I met Robert shock or a few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um a few a couple of years\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those ads linked tonight on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the row uh newest first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight uh you and a Robert football and Robert shock sat down and started discussing uh the the ...\nAnd ... at least that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulb started going off that got you involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is uh\nWhile I was reading things I hadn't met the gentleman yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if if an architect ah builds the three pyramids or an online and and want it to align them with the three belt starts with a wry and\nThey had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great pyramid the first one of the three you know\nAnd so I looked at the statue I started looking at the statue of he looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while I so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on a on the pedestal of that statue\nUm I noticed it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the or the book the that they just have co authored origins of the things which is an amazing book by the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section he's developing a you know something that he knows the dreams the law which is you know in front of the policy of the ... between the positive things and\nThere was a a so he was talking basically about the things in this guy and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about this things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the parents were built if there was a things then it said it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remember the line is on the pedestal one thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page\nRobert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or at the um I think it was causing the origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and\nWe uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it is a this could be a very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight you know why is it that the ... well the gays applied to in general but you had the great pyramid the grades things\nAre two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBy is not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt in history where you would think well you know do you do tunes love to write everything that he loved to scale didn't tell their story and not only that but taxes and and accounting in season everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the great things in the great pyramid why isn't missing in history\nThat that's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I I mean you know the one answer you could give is that maybe we just we haven't found a record so the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or maybe total absence\nUm and of course that was the problem with the things you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nAn inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look\nYou know I think I think we found something that leads to things um\n[noise] the pyramids we um you know when you're on next so that when you buy the great pyramid there is a tune from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years\nAfter a you know who fu ... was alive and if you walk into that to them there's actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the uh in in in the two of them is called uh the whole rise of coup food and next to it it's the um the you know the the country is great so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually Humphries pyramid\nSo they called at ... grade and coup was pyramid was called to Hawaii of Google\nAnd so this was a brief that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot too and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is the glaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou earn to the pyramid yeah you wouldn't expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have that but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other ... about how was builder who built under the year was build you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it can be all\nThe way to have auditors um you know fifth century but see now this was in during Persian rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of details you know are you saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plateau and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up the blocks but\nYou would think that he'll just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just his confusing is ... ... you know we also have those same issues and if there was a for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella ... we may not know anything at all but\nYes\nThat was the dream still a is a and you know there was a dispute or at the turn of the um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to foreign who is the author of the dream so between the positive things that he is the one who build it that was actually being debated\nUm but uh and there is a there is a small\nReference to fray but it's it it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that you build it [noise]\nUm and so that's the dream still at the end mentors the law on the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when ... came ... when I ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same as the ... the Greek name who posed the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that the human towards the United states very unequivocal early ... when ... came to the plot told this things already exist that in fact it was broken he repair that and then he built his pyramid and that one the end the pyramid of his queen Knutson\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now this coast to coast am I'm arrows to church or against the nightly news said ... and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back\nYeah and I just [noise] ... do you\n\n\n\n\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am I to me church it's the great pyramid all my ... be or we get to the great pyramid\nOr ... minute say it's ... am I knew we were talking about the inventories tell and the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward\nAnd end the dream still up a ... most of the fourth says mentions and and illustrates too ... says there and\nDesert Fox just tweeted\nIs there a second Spanx well there's two ... says there I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that that's my take a ... is there a second ...\nA great question on so that was fun that was one of the ... um who is interpreting\nThings in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is a ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these depictions are um you know they're on unmistakable\nSo so the answer to this question specifically of course it hasn't been found there is there are stories uh Arab historians referred to an actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the granted was used to build mosques\nSo they're they're apparently was physical things\nAre on the other side of denial but is there are things buried under the fans are let's say west of a conference pyramid it's possible\nThe ... you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired this things but build the great pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just to repair guy but he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy\nUh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as he had of course ecologist most causes do not accept the inventory Steeler as a historical document and\nAh for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we countered there's arguments so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so to your question\nUm they're the or you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egypt she means to read it means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the with the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is pet him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of the state law\nOr isn't is a strip of ... where you know the pyramid building is mentioned and the the verb ... this is not further a qualified with this word and based on that is that I'm just saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuild\nHum is that a hundred percent poof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the ... of ... that was found in ... in the right the\nYou know they're saying well you okay this is the ... talks about tour store and being ... or ... or um but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being\nShipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who you mean it was a ... interview you have what's in the other day he made a good point you said that ah he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was back failed and so that mean\nYou know some part of the perimeter or as you went up the courses and then you ... so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but\nYou know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their own mind about it\nAnd there was a quite a bit of relatives or a you know pyramids that coup was dealing with uh also one of the gains a plateau why could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramids\nThere are you oh you mean in the image or some of the U.S\nYes yes there is a there is a reference to a head Knutson\nUm Knutson a this was also you know a ... a contentious subjects so who's going to the news and so she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he build a pyramid for her at the southern most of the three ah off the three a queen permits that are on on the east field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but\nIn the human Tori Spelling it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting this dog because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a print says so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that gee I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we we think it the poop shows that she was a prince says so that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then do you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus on this and that those are much further reasons why you should always was rejected because they're saying\nYou know if this were an old kingdom story or at the time of coup who he's got a you know I sort of size we're not yet a weren't being worship there were not official states sanctions a ...\nAnd we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's contentious I I don't want to make it sound like we have the chance or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nAnd then there's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling may do need to look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same answer with the same care right and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect those to be just as elegant if even you know more complex you know they're not and\nThey're the stone work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing a A R is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that seemed to just comment that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I but I think the caller yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old king them I'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the word friendship definitely declined um after the old kingdom\nNow let's get to what happened last year which was the big news about\nAnd after we had been told over and over again\nAnd it just it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there well clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is one of the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing\nUm and and what I like about it is that it was non invasive um you didn't have to drill holds you didn't have to you know like a a ... the early explorers they used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful\nAnd nowadays uh it's kind of like the pyramid is telling us you know you wait until you have the technology to to find out about me or without destroying me and I think now we're getting to that point", "year": "2018", "show_name": "America in the Morning with John Trout", "city": "Coosada",
