A. W. land air and water and it's jam packed with odd spooky raised the hair on the back of your neck true life stories of people who simply vanished zip into thin air\nThe circumstances in each of these cases are very specific to a pattern that was discovered by Dave and up by now\nHe's looked at thousands of these disappearances and some patterns have emerged on land around ... water and as we will hear tonight in the air as well so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are ongoing at this moment fresh mysteries that maybe you can help solve\nA David joins me and just a few minutes and we will jump right into it but those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the woods or wilderness goes way beyond that\nAnd we will spend the next three hours talking about new evidence in cases he uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners your ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly taken a by whom\nAnd whether we will ever be able to resolve this so what you're thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news note here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first but worst mass murder incident in American history unfold fifty eight people were gunned down that an outdoor concert on the strip hundreds were wounded or injured\nAll week leading up to this date that the town is remember those who died those who were wounded those who've struggled to deal with what they witness that night\nDisappearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't\nAnd they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training they're smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any list and they don't have any of us a missing people in their parks and jurisdictions\nAnd uh we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues ... refiled and they came back in the attorney called this time and said well why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor in for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said well research and then it came back and he said well we don't have any of us a missing people\nI said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol\nAnd you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are to the detective\nSo somebody must be keeping a list that each individual location or acumen who was the headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it is it now\nYears ago somebody said well they are just file or across and see how many rules of toilet paper at Yosemite National park I bet they have that inventory list\nAnd of course they would but as it happened [noise]\nThey came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my authors status\nAs an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books earning enough libraries to qualify Lucian of such qualifier just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together but was from ... from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service\nAnd they said well it's gonna be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system and I can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have\nTried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting divorced from their entire system because they still say they don't have it\nAnd I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll sit right now\nWe will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets and we'll put a clip boards at every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list\nAnd they can hire an intern during the summer that can screen the monthly reports that come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now of course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it\nBut as you've stated and many others after you know but he believes them they say that the list exists [noise] [noise]\nWell uh if they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exists um you know it's it's pretty clear they don't want\nCooperate on this that they don't want\nMore attention to be drawn to it and uh it's a night we're going to explore and maybe some of the reasons behind that are for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the profile points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people\nYou're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things started jumping out at you and when I went through my third three hundred four hundred five hundred read of reports started making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about a Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine search and rescue that canines can't find a scent and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked in a canine unit on the farm team for a number of years our dogs had about a Ninety nine percent capture rate\nAnd ... probably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week\nAnd it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time to train a dog a lot\nThere might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a ... maybe the ... isn't there I've had reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person who was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out for like they don't want to search or they have no interest\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change weather event if the victim is located\nSometimes hundreds of times the time of the disappearance of a high high percentage of the time is three four five PM many of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can't explain what happened to him water plays a key role in this either the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water\nBoulders and granted play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world just somebody national park\nWell that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but granted plays much more of a role as I have explained in many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation you're walking down the trail with your friends your loved one and they walk ahead of you you fall behind them\nAt that point of separation something happened and that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that in interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's when it happens\nIt's almost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family that's when they move in\nEquipment malfunction and this is the this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books there\nWas an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with these searches and then people talk about other equipment their car other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this [noise]\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and I've never been found it's\nVery strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared that isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a medical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in this specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there's a this geographical clustering that I figured out after I started putting Ken's in a U.S map\nWhen I started to track this years ago and right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada now there are other locations in Lebanon other countries of the world where these this exact\nSame sort of thing is happening a lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book started to get rolling and people are different parts of the world read them\nAnd say hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing you case same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the eighties worse I mean you'd\nBe surprised how this fits into this little niche\n[noise] um\nAnd it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and it's men to women is a form to one ratio correct\nMy any idea why why so many more men than women may be more men are out in the outdoors and out there alone\nYeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women\nTalking with David ... about his latest work missing or one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they both raised the hair on the back of your neck of the Beatles take us into the break we'll be right back\n[noise]\nNa na na na\nUm for search and rescue uh yeah how how they proceed and and I a huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that\nPerson has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased [noise] they're released the report most time a lot of times they want there's a case from eighty six\nI'm an error the girl's name was the era of she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody looked at the case in Twenty years and especially if they're told me I'll never see that case it's a standard missing person case\nThere's no suspect there's no crime why can't I see it um and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the ...\nUh everything else in the law enforcement world is criminal oriented and missing people it's not against fraud go missing if you want to fall out of society you can\nAnd it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's gonna emanates from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you somebody\nBut these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lotta times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific\nThey don't have much data they don't have much information other times they are really really good\nAnd I don't understand why there and want us to see it but there's this I called territorial behavior and many of the times they won't grant you access now in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to be disposed to the public on the crust\nColorado has that laws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you've got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say the storage you can't trust the media\nBecause I Would say eighty percent of the time when I finally get a copy of the report\nThe news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened\nAnd I like to think back\nThirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's the superficial job of collecting information because it's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that uh you know reporters ... just regular beat reporters who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case you know like outside of Las Vegas ever been a couple that you and I've talked about before\nIt's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there's a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of the scene I'm who tells you to specific share the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further are you you defer to them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they'd really don't want to tell the story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird to explain\nIt makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have been a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know they don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the front line people that you see when you go into the parks heart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on\nIt's the people at the top tier in the government\nThat are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed in communicated\nAnd it's those individuals that have this [noise]\nThey exude this belief that it's their stuff it's not yours and you're not going to get it [noise]\nAnd I don't understand it I Can't explain it\nAnd every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports when the sheriff's office help on a search and they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything\nA national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and they got ... I wasn't supposed to get that but then it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare [noise]\nLet's talk about a couple of current cases I you you sent me some information about one Samantha Sayers ... what's the deal there\n[noise] so twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete I\nCame from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle\nShe liked to go to this a location a called ... per ... V. E. S. P. E. R. and she went there in August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet in elevation two miles northeast a spate of lake twenty five ... five miles east of the ocean Puerto Suzanne\n[noise] round trip hike up about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot game going up and a Thirteen hundred foot scrambled to the top\nSo I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really isn't much here but in in Washington that's a pretty good hike and the mountains there and just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here at fourteen thousand feet well\nSamantha did a lot right she told her boyfriend where she was going to one when she'd be back and he was the kind of guy that kept track of her ...\nWell when she didn't check in with him\nHe reacted the right way he went he went out and look for her while the investigation showed that she made the summit sometime too in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual man saw her at the summit and communicated with her ...\nWell that was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at the mountain about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for eventually called the ... county sheriff\nAnd the search was on\nSo that was on August first well that search went on for about twenty two days three hundred and fifty seven air operations that is extraordinary that's locked\nHundred and five hours of drone time\nA three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the family was on the scene everyday when you look at the area the majority of the time she was above what looked to be Timberline there isn't much up at the top of experts a pretty wide open area\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual that cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs and everything you can imagine there to help [noise]\nWell eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out I mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because you're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just Chuck it in with no more assistance\nBut the family had a lot of gumption they start pushing harder or they did some Kickstarter campaigns\nAre trying to pay for a food and things for friends that were just staying on site and searching day and night ...\n... I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and I kind of gave them this road map [noise]\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports\nOtherwise you're just going to be replicating that exact same effort that search and rescue stung before down a lot of instances that may turn some results because\nPeople are found in areas that have been previously search that's true but if they have a lot of area where they say that they haven't searched it very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do then that's\n[noise] but the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the sheriff wouldn't get many reports the search and rescue people weren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated\nNow this is the same thing I ... every family and if there's one listening out there is is what you have to do\nIt don't go to the local news media and you you understand this church is the local news media has to deal with the sheriff in that county day in and day out for the rest of their life they can't burn a bridge they came here to get 'em irritated they have to live with them but they national bureaus\n... Fox CBS NBC CBS the national bureaus you want to get one of those people in there and you want them to start stirring it up\nAnd then you want to send a family member down to the congressman or the senator's office and demand that they get more assistance and more help for you and you stay there until they realized there'd be a thorn in their side so that they get you more help", "show_name": "America in the Morning with John Trout", "year": "2018", "city": "Coosada", "day": "01"}
