Vegas [noise] perfect for our purposes tonight we have subjects and guess\nTonight that are both entertaining and waging both will challenge what you think you know about two very different subjects\nIn the second half tonight a story that involves incredible acts of heroism treachery incompetence and sheer terror it is the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history the sinking of the USS Indianapolis\nIt's taken more than fifty years for the full story to emerge from behind and official wall of secrecy and blame\nTo remarkable journalists have worked for years to tell the whole story I was totally blown away by their book it takes you right there into the water with the sailors as they struggle to survive shark attacks and the elements for days and days wow what a story a coauthor is Lynn Vincent and Sarah ...\nBe here to share what is already a runaway best seller of a book\nA but first I had hinted last month when ... was here that he had something else in the works I'm not sure when the guy sleeps but he returns to the program coming up and just a few minutes and in a sense he is returning to his roots\nYou know the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe is ten years ago to discuss his first book the ... project\nWas a typical day ... boots on the ground investigation this time of the big butt legend a day but spent two years among the ... tribe to hear their tails and legends and to apply police in forensic methods to figure out what was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest\nAs it turns out of course similar sightings have been reported all over the world and wild ... better known these days for his investigations are missing people he's never stopped thinking about or working on the big foot mystery and tonight he's back with a book that's a great resource for anyone interested in this subject\nIt traces the sasquatch story through newspaper reports and historical records that name big what has been around as we know since Nineteen fifty eight but\nFor that a police background I approach them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to\nI'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and they'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders\nAnd this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big story in Hooper that live miles away who someone coming into town I started to think about my police days and I used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing\nBut I wanted something that a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond unbelievable look an individual\nOr the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just quick like brothers\nAnd when Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and draw the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey drew the schedule the suspect that is how accurate this man has\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes they immediately accept accepted him because he's a ... Native American chief got a law enforcement background so we can kind of smell\nWhen it happens and\nArmy and I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends we did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called tribal Bigfoot where he went outside of Hooper and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd I'm kind of how it started\nA you say you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo uh when I started the most vocal the most audacious\nMost vulgar [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and\nThey will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause but since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kinda went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nAre they still kept that open mind and when we the\nFirst day that we sat down with the people in and around hoop and drew the sketches Harvey myself an arby's wife Gina proud also an agent for in Oklahoma we were set in stone disbelief\nBecause the sketches or very human like yeah they were huge yeah they have hair all over the body that there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss\nAnd they didn't look like apes they didn't have that ape characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera and it was just shocking and\nWhen the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady and to a man they would consistently say\nHarvey you nailed it that if the sack Lee ... you look like and when you talk of The Elders they would consistently say this is another tribe of people is on animals is there are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with them at least that coexistence right\n[noise] yeah it in the tribal area I met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\n'em and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nSo one thing about the hoop areas the trinity river like great salmon and steal headed area a has just so much wildlife\nAnd if you drive through hoop uh from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains than I've ever seen anywhere in the world\nAnd there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention in you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seeing eating at a lot\nAnd you are I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law a man as a former law man and the state of the evidence about this whether you'd say there is that there is there sufficient evidence that something is real here\nOr do we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a ah\nA PHD name Melba catch them Dr catch him\nWas one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blood et cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America the test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted\nA many of them were were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA and then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva\nAnd all of this novel worked through incredibly well or to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this in a\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA\nAnd what they showed was that the ... went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the female side to the ... Arab region to Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended that part of the world and this is when I was sent to a gym bank and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in this and\nUnbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever leading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her white a white paper about this [noise]\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab a completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could've been compromised\nYet [noise] as the paper was written before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce smell but two of their ... brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\n[noise] she listen to some of this but she didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you ... all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent\nHere and there I think it's true the reality is when you're\nWith a scientist who read the science behind the\nPaper they know that those hundred and ten samples so tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big but wild bent and giants use Harry noon and night the night night I mean big but ... air took us into the break\nEnsure that there was no mistake all the labs got the same results or was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you could see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that they'll but did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now is that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to the NA to ensure that they came back as big foot her\nThat people are saying going to say well how do you know that's big for their\nWell the ... looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hunters in North America and when you look at a big but here it's an entirely different so if it if\nThey didn't jump through that hurts\nAnd all of these DNA experts are not using her hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that Melba did to extract this DNA and to get the results and there's a lotta there's a lot of attitude in this arena as you know George\nAnd it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like a UFO world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to different levels\nUm to the point of raw Gillette material um and ah\nWill stab people in the back end will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence\n... at a minimum um\nPeople were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's humid but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part\nBut the second says it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with a human ... bank and when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that be a\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kinda surmise that\nThe a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appears that big foot was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe and blend on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked a game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big for look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this\nThat people haven't read the study they've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia that data and read the report because it's available online\nAnd see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit to Melba she's a genius scientists that figure this out um it's unfortunate [noise]\n[noise] yeah because it got down to a thrown under the\nUnder the bus as she did as well um ... you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or are they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it\n\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I mean a lot of times these descriptions and there were some amazing working here there's some\nReally a tremendous\nSo but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading it off and making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eighty how did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed to MIT that fit that profile but we were looking for but then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of\nThe way the articles were worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as the description\nTwenty four used ape gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else now the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U.S sixteen\nEven Canada three in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it\nA whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana live in New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six\nAnd then the numbers keep going down from there but\nAgain it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article in the missing\nBut I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon palms a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants and big foot\n[noise] and one of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius is a lot of people say oh you know if you're overly this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the same\nAnd he puts up a map of like Bigfoot the ah appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes out like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything because you know what this map of because of a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated the same locations as the big fight\n[laughter] and\n... but it was his statement\nAbout ... giants that were found in past centuries in mountains and in a excavations that really kinda got me thinking or these giant the big for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more\nGiants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories here in Nevada you know the pirates and shown to you have legends and stories about the big foot bones or a giant bones that were\nStashed in that came up in northern Nevada and are you ask what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find\nA lot of these articles pointed to um some universities would get them but the the more likely candidates were all these went and it said in the articles was the Smithsonian yet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't how\nLook back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book it's from the Maryland gives that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an encounter a witness sees this on the ... of a rubber an animal between twelve and Fifteen feet high it's a shape\nAn equal proportion to the body the feet are two feet long and Harry uh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the descriptions semi modern descriptions of big\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds I I was stunned because nobody talks about it\nBut when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between Trump and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being except the head which is like you said an equal proportion to the body so I'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and\nNobody nowadays is ever brought this stuff up\nSo one of the articles I put in the tribal big foot book that nobody wants to talk about\nWas in Nineteen thirty four there was a series of trail site incidence in Washington where hikers and hunters and things were getting rocks thrown at him and they saw this figure that look like a big foot", "year": "2018", "show_name": "America in the Morning with John Trout", "city": "Coosada", "day": "22"}
