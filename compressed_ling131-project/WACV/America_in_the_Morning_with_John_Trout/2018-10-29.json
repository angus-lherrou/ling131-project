I'm a big um so the follower of of John ... would particularly and I think one of the things for me at least\nI mean now you know different people get different responses from from reading his books but from my perspective I I kind of take the view that is most important um [noise]\nRevelation they feel like all conclusion was that many of these phenomena seem to be\nMulti connected if you like to connect to and by that you know you have a lot of reports where people have seen big foot tall creatures and in the same location and timeframe a site for example UFO activity\nI'm the most money point pleasant West Virginia in the sixties um when they were ...\nThe guys both point pleasant he'll settle load of encounters with the men in black and you've been following cancer so I think some of these creatures at least some of the but we're the ones like ... mine and the dog men and things like that\nI think I'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of crypto zoology oh creatures seeking 'cause I'm not entirely sure they are creatures around animals in the way we understand it\nUm you know when you get reports of saying a big fan issue in a flash of light\nOr you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing\nIt makes me think that we daily with something that's perceived as an animal that night may not be I don't think Kael was I'm someone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people\nJust didn't like just turn their heads they just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle and fail with the the weirdest side of these phenomena\nIn this book the book monsters are several reports early in the book\nThat sort of blend together at least in my head you got wolf men go ugh men are where ... where cats ... are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities um or or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon is trying to a Web well from a regular person you know that's sort of all the [noise]\nThe Hollywood imagery butts the fact that people do report seeing I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seem to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs um\nI've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I've never gone to reports of someone you know literally shapes you see like in American we have all the London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that it's the the locations where these dog men talk creatures have said is intriguing it very often these\nAncient burial mountains I'm Native American land um some of the the the mysterious all mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing Robyn just said that random\nYou had one ah werewolf case that was from a military base it's not ancient either it's more recent times remember them yes\nYou know this was um other British a bicycle Roy land for was helping break and ah I actually was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was um [noise] er an American guy but it's working a overseas it already if I can break in\nThe Nineteen seventies when there were a number of vices which had I'm an American presence there is there's a high to the Cold War and he he saw that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ...\nAnd would have sort of kind of look like a big foot taught creature who was it not for the five but just the the face was very different\nTo how you're describing night\nAnd it was more like a long muzzle with point today is very much like a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of a big ... with a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um\nYou know I didn't see any reason why he should know creates a story like federal fabricate the story like that he was um\nIn the military and he said he just wanted to share the story because they've never forgotten about it and it was so when\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are report\nThese huge dogs I mean right out of ... you make that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic cats and that you know you can see All right maybe as an animal the skate from the zoo or maybe in somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the ... the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the encounters have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the the dog was\n[noise] ... yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal parts you know clearly is not\nWell in England or they get okay we have what are known as find some black dogs now\nI'm Conan off of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel under the ... he actually based his novel on a pre existing legend I'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k.\nUm that typically a much longer much larger than regular dogs I might be a fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the old legends and traditions if you were to see one of these um find some black dogs what are the main that you would die or a close family member or friend would die\nI'm On the ... the dog my entire often seen at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um\nPlaces like that in mobile racing is I've got several um reports of people seem to find some black dogs in the vicinity of stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but you know there are many many um smaller\nI'm full nations around the u._k. and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses so one of these large black dogs that and like the old case he's going back centuries the dog was that one second and then what literally gone the next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what these things all you know clearly not normal dogs I mean all nice the spirits of\nDogs that once lived um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the\nSpirits of of that dogs would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm\n... and then there's the odds are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cat lived there\nNow you write and then they become known as the bases highly um big cats and I get every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of people saying large black cats robbing the u._k. now\nThe occasional sort of ask guy has got to pay you know from a zoo menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases\nAnd you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have this guy from ... but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is there are these large black cats roaming around the K which simply defy explanation because\nThe sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of the top of Scotland these hundreds every\nNow for that many reports to exist you know there must be anti colonies of these creatures roaming around that is if they are flesh and blood regular animals which not every researcher the phenomenon\nOr exotic explanations on a moment talking with Nick red burn about is the monster book creatures beach and beans of nature of this could be the rock and roll theme song for Halloween AC DC hell's bells we'll be right back\nEl ... TV show beyond belief with George Mallory simply go to beyond belief dot com or\n\nLike a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of polling places in the sixties or with a ... some kind of ... in that respect than there were\nThere were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the ... one of the name and spoke to the local police so I don't really know what the police could have known about it but um [noise]\nBut it was even trade in that you know you have this by to wait activity in this area which he's all ready notorious for sightings of things interesting enough a lot a dog man and a the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story or in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven that surfaces at a wind chills of all places in Sunnyvale, California\nOh yeah that that's really creepy story and I guess appropriate for um Halloween and this is a story I given to me by a lady named Terri and she had this thing\nI can only cold like money and black and not the men in black ... portray bar Will Smith and told me lead Jones in the movies but the real many black much weight and that sort of very ... and eight\nAnd don't and look entirely human by suitable ... ... ... like I Know a lot of power normal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know whereas in the movies ... secret agents of a sacred agency\nBut Terry telling me the story of hands Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time she was having lunch with a friend\nAnd they ... creepy mining black kind towards them sat down\nAnd proceeded to tell Terry I'm basically the the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy and she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like the money was he was that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of ... this old black suits and just gave off base really I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... but he didn't really come across as being completely human [noise]\nDidn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her or yes\nThat's right so she had a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of\nFull crafted that to happen and um\nI think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never really gone it's all ... states and I think\nYou know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life and you know believing that's what they said we'll things said I'm gonna come true you know I mean you could understand how we would create a great deal of stress for someone\nYou know the man stories at least the movie version of marked man is that this creature appears\nIn different forms to different people at different times but as a harbinger of doomed to come that predates a bad things that are about to happen is that sort of how you'd think it plays out in the ... point pleasant and beyond\nWell yeah I mean there's no doubt that it's um you know when you look at them off my story that it's sort of saturated even weirdness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked off the lights sixty six important plants in West Virginia\nI when people started seeing this creature that some people described as like a flying humanoid a few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act to others described as a giant bud\nAnd I'm ... whatever that I was seeing people would play that I Would say something way bigger than any normal but or or anything like that\nAnd when the scientists that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of weeds a UFO activity\nOr the surfacing of these weird creepy character Ninety injury cold it was like approach how money in black and also a lot of other amyloid bay in Kansas and also reports of women and black\nTurning up and threatening a UFO witnesses on the highlights of it of course you know you have the specter of the month month flying around town\nNow in December sixty seven um they the towns um as it's called ... or as he was called the silver bridge collapsed into the Ohio River um point pleasant someone side of the Ohio River in Ohio it was on the other side obviously\nAnd um the bridge collapsed into the river killing dozens of papal\nAnd various research is um addressed the the connection or the ...\nUm the collapse of the bridge and the deaths and you have that was really sort of two overriding theories one but my mom that caused the disaster but that's all that it was sort of um a warning and to tell you that in ... in its own strange way try to warn people of\nLooming um disasters ... look\nI'm that's still very much they pay people to buy took upon you know to this day but um but it's also an English equivalent to be known as the our mind which also has these sort of Penn and try to red eyes and large wings in a a humanoid form\nA friend of mine John diamonds who's looked into this case deeply John eventually had to walk away from the research because he found that every time he started to get back into the\nRace or she didn't invest your guide to the ... stories about things would happen to him like car accidents and I'm ill health\nAnd it happens so many times close to just after he started doing the research that he realized from his perspective\nBut it really was as if you know a cloud of a dark cloud would come over him every time he got into he said he quite literally I've actually said I'm done you\nKnow I'm I'm staying away from it because he felt somehow it was getting his claws into\nA resurgence of interest in marked man in recent times are in the Chicago area a lot of reports of people who've seen the same thing and I I don't have a strong feeling of it either way whether it is wishful thinking on the part of people who follow this sort of stop and we should what happened or\nWhether there's some credibility to those sightings what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange creatures waves in the field of crypto zoology you know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... creatures scene in Chicago last summer um and we get Honda spite so old waves of activity in\nRelation to other creatures I mean for example in the Nineteen seventies in much of Pennsylvania um there was certain spots and outbreaks of flu activity\nUm some of these like bumps the stories you know that they won't be any side things for years and then suddenly those you know a two week period we get a lot of things like that\nAnd um that kind of um on glee feel like he's sort of paralleled throughout various other types of of creatures so again I'm inclined to think that may be\nYou know something that suggests again a connection between these creatures even though they are perceived as being very difference of course but uh but that that way of activity\nIn um Chicago last year it was very interesting now from my perspective although I didn't really investigate the ... things because um there are a lot of people\nUm who are already looking into each one of them a friend of mine Alison John Lennon shaving two and a lot of good research into it but what I did I wrote a couple of articles about aids\nAnd it ... to have a number of witnesses to them off in Chicago I'd certainly afterwards had sold most of the dice or prevent take dreams of nightmares of nuclear destruction and um [noise]\nAtomic mushroom clouds and you know the end of civilization\nAnd I actually had somebody in the ... region of close to thirty people respond to that article\nUm who many of them living in the Chicago area who found that's um you know something might happen or others I had that he's that continue Graham dreams and nightmares of atomic war in the United states and I'm On my face\nOh they ... ... ... talk preachers so in that sense you know that was that was kind of a disturbing situation you know to get all these nuclear nightmares as I told him you know from people who say they strange creatures who was was kind of you know be disturbing\nUm ... and I think you're a you're careful not to take too strong position in defense of some of these cases but occasionally you will make a comment that let your readers know where you are on that you would respond to\nCritics who tried to just brush it off and I I Know you have to be careful you don't want to commit the need these things because you know it's hard it's hard to prove it one way or another right\nWell yeah it is hard to prove anything but I mean you know I've ...
