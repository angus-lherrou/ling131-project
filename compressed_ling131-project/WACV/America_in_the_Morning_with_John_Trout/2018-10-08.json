and let us bring in Joshua ... worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nGeorge I am so excited to be on the program tonight it's Halloween the event oh I Love it\nOr we're going to dig into this extremely creepy thing it's like I'm anti of mirrors I also have an update for you\nAbout time warps in UFOs uh later on we're going to give away some free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday and there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with you drive\nThe way I'm bum 'cause I've got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of be will be with you OK\nWell ... you know what when people say that to me it means something to do things you\nGot that aren't the cycle man the of it's a small enclosed area set up with a chair dim lighting the mirror is angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd a number of other people in person in the command him technique um and it it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager because\nI started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the uh local newspaper and I found again and again when I go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and say this is the most talented room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I find a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomena um there are number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors face each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infant a tunnel\nRight like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light as electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of light which operates has some sort of a portal [noise]\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a nearby room [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know what consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of these spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to cry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or Greek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective of substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience Georgian and then I Want everybody to understand this I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of it\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this\nYou will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional seemingly core portrayal figure that will appear right in front of your head to toe\nAnd this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but touch\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to does it go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother\nThan he would take you through a period of time that could be days where he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find the reminds you of her and he pictures\nAnd he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there\nYour mind is charged with that intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through now when this becomes very scary as when you have people who experiment\nOr you know people talked about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble or anything you know the people who go in there\nAnd they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude\nThat's a ... you you will well you know it you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a psycho Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments where you know we'll set up a camera to see if we can record they experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in front of\nIt and I'm not that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nBloody Mary and boy you know all that kind of stuff yeah I think ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays Eli the laugh in the background\nAnd maybe some light and ... I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento him experience and I would say that uh that's a lot of people chores or is it is a lot of people you know I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody\nAnd a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the the people\nHad some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had the full\nTalk about time warps in some UFOs here's our first emerging artists Paul Ruben from Santa Barbara California wants a song called winter when it's\nWent to a\n[noise]\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and the ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas that area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the in your state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nAnd so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um\nI mentioned this T when we were in Asheville by the way with very cool that you played a a a group from Ashville North Carolina the group in Ashville is my home town for for listeners who may not know\nAnd uh you know that's where I have my mystery museum and we do the halted Ashville ghost tours so very very fitting ... Nashville group [noise]\nBut anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think\nIn context okay [noise]\nUm and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just incidents or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that as sort of a being slowly revealed or expose however you want to hear it\nAnd of course I never believe in coincidence is Josh\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe and that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does the Jordan new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that the that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media but it was not it was not no I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop\nUh and this was a program that was a course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was it was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada\nTo keep that in mind uh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars bankrupt now later in the month of June\nBe precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night\nThen I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force so here I Am next to Harry fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July\nOn July twenty fifth now NASA announced as there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around the same time George Jeanette whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in a state of Nevada and they're doing one yes\nHe is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine\nIf any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it this is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional\nAerospace related findings\nHe goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management and safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient he goes on to say even more\nAnd this is the one that really gets me\nAssociated exotic\nBooks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries an unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here\nSo he said and this letter which is a validated it's been verified live independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise]\nHe's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's right we we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is that didn't come from them new\nSo if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic where could have possibly come from um I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to this where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project and some of these topics there's thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking worm holes in space time gravity wave communication warped drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there is one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and a ... which which July twenty fifth\nAll right so that said now we move up to August August of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville joined the\nMainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry which is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb\nAnd they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom ... to ... air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore guests when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space force\nSo that said\nI Am of the impression here that there is some kind of amazing technology\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing ... there's there's stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt what I'm telling you you can download this information for free if you go to Joshua ... dot com\nAnd scroll down the home page there's a place where you can it says something like you know Senator Harry Reid's PDF\nGeorge do you think that that is a coincidence that this stuff is lining up the way it is\nNo coincidence is you know that none in the let me ask you this when the late president Ronald Reagan initiated and wanted to initiate his Star Wars program I was convinced he was more concerned about something coming from outer space that we needed to protect ourselves from\nWhen President Trump announced a space for ... do you think it was the same motives\nI think it was certainly part of it uh well for one thing there's probably pretty good reason to believe that something like a space for its has existed for a long time now [noise]", "show_name": "America in the Morning with John Trout", "year": "2018", "city": "Coosada", "day": "08"}
