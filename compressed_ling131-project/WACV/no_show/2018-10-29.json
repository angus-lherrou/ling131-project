witnesses so one of these large black dogs that and like the old case he's going back centuries the dog was that one second and then quite literally gone the next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what these things all you know clearly not normal dogs I mean all that he's the spirits of\nDogs that once lived um I guess the only downside with that is a much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the\nSpirits of of the dogs they would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm\n... something and then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cats lived there\nWell you're right and then they become known as the bases Ireland big cats and I get every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of people saying large black cats robbing the u._k. now are\nThe occasional sort of ask guy has got to pay you know from a zoo menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases\nAnd you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have this guy from ... but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is there are these large black cats roaming around the K which simply defy explanation because\nThe sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of the scope of Scotland these hundreds every now\nFor that many reports to exist you know there must be anti colonies of these creatures roaming around that is if they are flesh and blood regular animals which not every researcher the phenomenon things that's the case\nWe're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about who's the monster book\nBut this could be the rock and roll theme song for Halloween a C.

the end at the many of the experiences that people report over the centuries things that happened to them for real or not real they can't exist and therefore they don't\nKnow the disconnect between centuries of human experience and rigid doctrine is\nMaybe one reason why so many people have given up on science in ways that are probably inappropriate and unfair and also possibly dangerous is there a way to reconcile the seemingly bizarre experience as the people have reported through the centuries out of body experiences missing time time slips\nNear death encounters other realities of science versus spirituality science and religion is their way to bridge all of that well Dr Christopher white has written a remarkable new book\nThat offers a unique and new understanding of topics that we often discuss here on this program but can't really explain\nOther dimensions of the realities whether or not this reality might bleed into others and vice versa\nIn a moment we'll take a deep dive into the deep end of that pool and I think you will be enthralled as I was when I read this will be right back [noise]\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions a fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just to get forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions on not just before the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh and more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are\nYour members every audience a part of string theory but sure um he's made so yes there string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theory is that incorporate these other dimensions and and they do it again in order to\nMake make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern ever in the universe\nTheir string theorists and I'm a radical businesses mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics\nAnd the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seem to govern reality um and we know that both sets the equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit together\nHave we we have we have a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and I'm like governor governor subatomic world with the er the atomic world world of quantum\nAnd we know those equations work we know they're correct on the other hand we haven't set of equations that govern the movement hum\nOf the of the very large so planets and sons and galaxies and is on 'em and these are signs\nA series of general relativity we we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorists and others are assuming that there are additional spatial dimensions\nAnd they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together\nBetween sort of the ... version and the quandary version you add things like spooky action at a distance or which of scientists have struggled to explain entangled in theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean you know a mathematician who who work on on these subjects\nI'm also have to wrestle with other mysteries right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know\nThey're they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having two sets of equations that don't fit together and they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange and uncanny um implications of\nOf quantum physics that um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I try to talk about that in the book as well write the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is\nAbout scientists who work on these ideas but then I'm a scientist who doesn't have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who who have religious experiences and start to talk about them is higher dimensional or somehow related to some some concepts and physics\nOr maybe we could use flat land as a illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land it I guess it was a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nAbsolutely have flatland a great little book I'm Phil ... kind of classic science fiction or math fiction book written a long time ago a written in Eighteen eighty four\nHas quite a cultural life and in fact\nI remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students all over the world still read flat land as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live in the kinds of spaces and kind of dimensions we live and so\nIt's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott he was British he was he was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to coming to age in a\nIn an era of science and wrestling with what it meant to be religious and scientific at the same time\nUm you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine was Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of um there were a number of challenges I guess you'd say to Christianity\nAnd Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing this wonderful book flatland which is a book about a lower dimensional two dimensional world any rooted in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um embedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe\nBut habits flat world was that was a two dimensional world but the book takes place and a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat and his populated by\nTwo dimensional objects as objects which is linked in with some of them were flask where some of them were black circles are flat triangles and and even even line they would all slide around on the surface of this flat world and of course they believe that\nUm they lived in a two dimensional world until the climax until the climax of the of the novel when\nA three dimensional object of fear inserts itself it was down in in in in search itself into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks\nOut on his his flat line the rise and sees the appearance of this mysterious object he starts talking to them and the sphere says I'm you know I'm I'm a three dimensional object\nThe spurs says this can't be possible\nIn the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world has become better than a larger world so the sphere regards to a more um extreme measure and he he reaches over and pulled the square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and\nOf course the than the square looks around and ... which down on his flat world that can for the first time the the whole world spread out in front of them\nThough the square it becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of higher dimension but there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back to flat world of course and it's pretty enthusiastic about this and can't can't stay quiet about it and unfortunately in ... it's forbidden\nIt's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of hired mentioned so he's put in jail where he where he stays for a number of your ears and and the story ends with\nThis for flat square languishing in prison I'm hoping that his readers ... from his readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye because of their reality so he sort of ...\nThe idea that the high price of flat land wouldn't allow or anybody to talk about the other dimension I met a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interested in commenting on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived right sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild Fox but ah but the square character did have these wild often and I even have this vision or experience right where he saw that there was\nThat there was another space or direction to reality and I'm\n... I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to\nYou know think about the possibility that above our free spaces are three spatial dimensions that might be others um that we don't see and we go through our life I'm thinking that our world is the only world\nBut you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about and fun to imagine um but when you combine higher dimensions and the ... it gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter]\nI tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who were inspired by this idea\nOf a a very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through\nTrials in turmoil or in trying to get their head around it as as I have a at but we'll we'll get into that in a moment or we're talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the doors re going through that goes into the break\n[noise] to find out where George ... speaking ... dot com website and scroll down to the bottom and click you were just ...\n\n\n\n\nIn\nWhich case you know\n\n\n\n\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual um levels are worlds to reality I Am an incumbent interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right and the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a\nAnd he kinda hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the math provide certainty 'em to him but I think is his stories a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nI must say in the book he developed for the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions than he is very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAnd then he he starts to think you know what if these what if these mathematical variables in my ... and you know these higher higher dimensions but I'm using what if they actually have a real existence somehow um you know what if the math points to the real existence of these kinds of\nFaces and he\nHe thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he developed a way of what he thought of as a sort of re educating the fences in order to catch glimpses into the\nInto the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the fences they involve um new it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled a all twenty seven are labeled and stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube you know it's three by three by three\nUm and he'd and then he he memorized says the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll ah and then he'll rotate a Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions\nUm exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond than the normal range of perceptions that we have so and his mathematical colleagues\nSort of shook their heads I think ah you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um and doing the research but instead he he was doing things like putting this this this cue these keeps it together and helping coach the prince and baseball team and he actually he actually also invented the pitching damage was one of the first\nUm um you know automated pitching devices I'm ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure prince and [laughter] he\nUh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that\nYou know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these are ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are\nSeeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you document and trace I mean this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you've got a sin mistakes and I would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto a do they all use this idea for their own purposes [noise] [noise]\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife or heaven and so on and so I'd hindrance ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both on both of their um [noise]\nNo the writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas a spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people are in the U.S and then in Europe take these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book and chapter seven\nChapter eight is is cs Lewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs Lewis a hernia\n... with a faint fame famous British a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer he uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions\nTo rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he\nHe incorporates them in a number of sermons I'm In an end is right and then of course many people are familiar with the send fantasy writings and the same ideas are in there as well he's got he's got reference to hire dimensions at 'em and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested\nIn them spiritually to you know he he was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist\nOr like many many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war\nAnd becomes this illusion there's a number of people in there you know precisely in there and James Bennett and I'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have that they get into combat situations OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nFamous rabbi that hip an ear and out of body experience right\nRight exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and cause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for some of them those war experiences and disillusioned them and turn them off from religion but others are like like James Bennett\nA he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talk about in chapter six\nIt's predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like a chapter on so he has this out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimension how that might help explain what happened to him\nWell let's talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how how this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else Ohio reality another reality [noise]\nYeah yeah yeah the drinks are fascinating and um dreams or seemed to be important and just about every culture around the world um you know and in many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of uh [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation books and we have people like the Swiss psychotherapist Carl young who many people know about who\nIs is really important for people once they think about interpreting their dreams and so yeah people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams and in my book\nUh especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the the spiritual meaning of dreams [noise] um [noise] in that book uh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British aeronautical engineer also was soldier and goes into combat and the second Boer War in South Africa\nRight around the turn of the twenty century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh too\nAnd he starts to have dreams that\nI'm not surprised him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams are then seem to happen in real life so he has he has predicted dreams or ... what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams his dreams that seem to predict the future\nAnd these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin\nIn as he's camped out with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wondered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress I'm In a battle and these kinds of things but he would have dreams\nAnd then he would wake up generally what happened was that he would have dreams and then you wake up and the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so one one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his book\nHe has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill towards the ocean he's obviously on an island he recognizes the island as someplace he's already been in his dreams\nHe notices that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting gas on the ground

lot of literature now about near death experiences they people do sometimes use the language of higher dimensions to talk about what they experience\nI'm not to say on says in the same category but you do a address say on this end up people's attempts to reach a\nHigher power or another world um [noise] yeah what's going on with those folks are they is there any legitimacy to that or do you not want to pass judgment on it\nYeah I don't know um [noise] you know it's funny it's funny writing a book like this because you know I've never had any of these experiences [laughter] yeah I've never

they understand what's happening [noise] um but I don't I don't know about Santa is you know I I wouldn't rule it out as being as being possible you know I mean I think that I mean if one thing if

than meets the guy um\nYou know I I Do believe that a man and I think we know that from science I mean when you when you look at these or the business is a cosmologist and read their\nRead their

all those kinds of things you know I\nI I wouldn't be so arrogant as the as the you know sit here and say oh you know you definitely there is no way that anyone could have an experience like that um I guess I Would just remain open to the open to those possibilities\nI you know I think what people would want to know is a is there a higher dimension that habit that would count as had been and if so do we go there and do we live live on beyond this\nYeah yeah right that's another big question that I Try to raise in the book you know the book it has all of these big questions um [noise]\nYou know and and I don't answer that question in the book I think that's another question like your question about spirits and goes and found says I'm I'm certainly open to the to the possibility there um and personally I I I Do believe that there is a nother world that we get a draft of this world I mean personally I Am I'm a believer you know I'm\nI Do believe in God and I do believe in spirit so I think I'm I think I Would line up more on that side of things with a kind of an openness to these different possibilities I'm like I say in the book I Try to put different voices in there who have different

B. Priestley I talk about in chapter six quite a bit he's a fascinating character I'm a very famous British writer playwright twentieth century and BBC broadcaster\nHe gets really I'm interested in higher dimensions hum he read him than who we talked about he reads Jay W done who have talked about um and he comes up and developed his own theories\nInterestingly Priestley like some of the other figures in the book has a combat experience he also fights in World War one and a young person and as um as an adventure\nUm and he also has some he also has some unique experiences of feeling like he's out of time I'm feeling like he's out of the body and then he writes this great book that the caller mentioned a called man and time\nUm and in the book he has all kinds of testimonials from people who have written about their\nPre cognitive dreams they their dreams that pain to predict future events um he actually gets on the BBC\nIn Nineteen sixty two are sixty three can't remember\nAnd he he asked the the viewing audience to write him letters if they've ever had an unusual time experience I have ever slipped out of time if they've ever had a dream that predict the future and uh he got over Fifteen hundred letters from from the from the viewing audience but like many letters still extent\nThat still at the University of Bradford I've been married to read through all the letters and I I incorporate a number of time in my book\nEspecially will be a Christian or white will take a break we are talking about other worlds with Chris white and Tom Petty things as it into the break we'll get to more of your calls and questions minimum\nDuring the ... Facebook page with thousands of members is great pursue updates in connecting with other ... to ... am and click the like button\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd actually some classes I teach at Vassar College I talk about meditation on reflective surfaces so you know there's\nThere's even iPhones crying you know I don't know if you've heard that word is crying before but that is sort of meditating on a reflective surface it could be a computer screen or television screen or reflective water or a crystal ball or a number of different services but I Know that that is a spiritual and visionary practice that a number of people use\nIn order to you know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um [noise] yeah\nSo that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nI'm Marcia I just wrote down I'm going to give that a try thanks for the suggestion\nThat dollar\nPhone banks and the idea right east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut by Michael\n...\nWhat happened to me is I I started writing a dream journal and I I wrote a dream that my mother's husband who was that was going to give me his car and all my money so\nI didn't believe it was going to happen but it did happen and I'm now drive in his car and I got the money too so it was very strange to me a dream I wrote it down with them with a date on it and everything and it came true like mom Slater [noise]\nYeah yeah that's right yeah there's a\nThere's a whole technique that GW done talks about in his book experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it and it sounds like\nYou did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream up you write it down right away and and um people hold journalism and think about your dreams and he believed that you know like you you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these glimpses I'm going into the future and their dream so that's that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for sharing a wildcard lied Joe in Monterey, California good morning Joe\nGood a good evening George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I\nThought that it might be better if I introduce another concept to him as a what they call super conscious mind\nI'm not I'm In remote a few in remote viewing has it's drawbacks this is um is a mental or is this a mental travel or sold travel but it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel the cool super conscious mind and you can access these high of world\nUm I Do this with my clients and uh they go into these different worlds for different reasons whether it's hailing whether it's me to love one uh for other reasons um it's an extremely um complex\nIt was out there doing so much so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a considered also\nA kind of um higher shelf of remote of writing is a is not like you're writing automatic because that automatic writing is really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all it does all you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a train stayed and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it will start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher self\nYeah yeah I liked that comment because it reminds me of um you know sometimes the ways that people talk about higher dimensions as a as a as a dimension of consciousness right I'm In ... and you definitely have the twentieth century psychologist and Carl young and many others um and\nWhen we talk about there being three spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or dimension where would that be some people say well it's it's going in you know it's not going out somewhere is going to end that consciousness sort of um occupies this the sort of a new direction um and yeah through meditative practices\nI think it is possible to to access those those dimensions um you'd asked if I meditate I Do meditate you know I Do sort of mindfulness meditation and I definitely get into a\nRight into zone where you feel sort of peaceful and quiet and calm I haven't had any visionary experiences of all meditating if it's much more a\nMuch more mundane unfortunately but um but I Do I Do meditate um and and do some of those practices and in my book I talk about others who have these kind of visionary meditative practices um sounds like what you do\nThanks joke for the call you know you read about a musicians and writers who suddenly get inspiration from just out of the blue McCartney has written about you know writing yesterday you woke up with it in his head yeah or or or other songwriters entire songs already written it came from somewhere else\nYeah and you talked and talked to scientists about scientific creativity and scientific convention and many scientists will have the same kind of stories some of them will talk about dreams some of them will talk about other forms of inspiration some of them will say that these ideas came from somewhere else and I don't know where they came from\nSome of them will talk about different there's ... there's different layers of consciousness um\nSo I think there's a lot of mystery isn't there\nA Gordon in Lakeland, Florida good morning Gordon on the wild card mind your own with Chris white\nGeorge ... uh I don't think I've ever called in the years or are you calling for no reason Dr Chris why thank you for taking my call but before I ask a question I wanted to just\nReference

it'd be different for reference I'm a Christian\nBut hold to the Iran in the Eighteen prohibition against contracting\nThe spirit world but now they can contact us\nThen I'll have a theory that in most cases I'm ... and ... I wanted to ask your opinion whether the up and you saw the video up there on on\nUh the your post last night I think that they may be using magnets to make a that pops up a pencil and can jump around but I also think it's possible but there are genuine\nDemons angels uh\nIn a way to do it but it could be or maybe extra crossroads Eighteen from another dimension and somehow hold in most cases the dean masquerading as you I thought it was Eighteen but there may be Eighteen stay on the line in case you want to ask me questions or something because this was pretty neat\nWell that's all they're Gordon let's let's get their take on some of that\nYeah there there's a lot there um there is a lot there and there's a whole all of the uh all of the science fiction literature and um\nAnd even alien abduction literature uses that language of other dimensions right that that these that these beans came from another dimension I'm so there definitely is a lot of that in my book and there's a lot of American Pop culture\nAbout um other dimensional or other dimensional being um he also raise the question of\nYou know what is the relationship of UFOs and extra traditional cultural beans to ghosts and spirits or demons and that that's also a question that people raise 'em and I'm not sure I'd be able to shed any additional light on that I I Know that from just some of my reading and and not literature\nI think I'm thinking of like ... I don't know if you know ... stuff on on communion or he actually has a new book I'm\nI'm On the subject as well but he he talks sort of like you do I mean he he also wonders um what's the relationship is between\nAlien abduction and extraterrestrials on the one hand versus um spirits and goes on the other so he I think Whitley has come to come to believe that there's there's a connection um and it sounds like you've come to believe that as well but there's a\nThere's a connection somehow you know maybe departed spirit um our aliens or aliens or departed spirits\nI Know we we explore the idea of a unified theory of weirdness on the program or Chris Rock in looking for his actions\nAnd you'd be amazed how many scientists are behind the scenes are interested in those kinds of subjects as well whether there's a connection yeah looking at the idea of the University of many worlds theory and you talk about it in your book of course\nIt wasn't that long ago that that would have been too far out or just about any of them to accept and now it's it's not all that a controversial anymore\nIsn't it crazy yeah it's really crazy I mean yeah and there's a number of ways of thinking about a world or a universe with many worlds right I mean you mentioned the many worlds theory quantum mechanics and there's of course also the the multiverse idea right the multiverse ideas that there's\nYou know I'm a large number or an infinite number of other universes in addition to our visible universe and [noise] you know I um I Believe now that that's a that's a very mainstream um I prefer to conventional wisdom now among cosmologists and theoretical physicists thought that there is a multi birth you know which is\nUm and that that's another fantastic scientific concept but there's not proof for there's really not proof for that idea but it it is it has become a kind of an appealing idea to scientists\nAnd then you mentioned the sort of many infinite parallel universes of many worlds theory or the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics\nOr another idea that we live in a complex and constantly branching universe where there's multiple copies infinite copies of all of us doing all kinds of other things right and in parallel world so\nOn your show by then I got to know me and said hey you know on any other way\nHey what do you want to know me down down\nDown\nDown down down down down the\n\nLaw by hand and on and they say about\nOkay oh hey hey hey ho ho man you know down the\nNa na\nNa na na na na\nNa\nNa na\nNo no no no\nNo no no no doubt about that but\nYeah na na\nNa na na na na\nWallet dot our daily brought his\n... radio\nSo long commutes outside and in the morning\nDeal Iran has FM radio\nNo matter if that sounds great\n\n\nThey don't want to be a danger to do\nAnd then on the\nRadio\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control centers visit W.

alleged synagogue shooter posted hateful messages is off line gap dot com is popular among white nationalist and the alt right it's CEOs says nine million people visit the site every month the suspects biography on the site contain the anti Semitic rhetoric\nIn a statement gab road is unequivocally disavow zinc condemns all acts of terrorism and violence free speech is crucial\nFor the prevention of violence CBS News contributor and editor in chief of wired Nicholas Thompson is here with a look at the responsibility social media platforms have when it comes to hate speech so why didn't go back for a fact earlier\nOrganic very much has founded on principle of free speech capitalism if it's legal to say something they will allow it on the plot that has a very different philosophy from most other social media platforms right now\nOf their principal can get right on ... I think is that even something that we could even discuss or\nA single so that is the most important question what happened is that all of the infrastructure underneath gap so it's hosting provider payments providers they all said yesterday\nWere done we're not going to protect you that's why I gather is knocked off line and in one way it's strange that hosting providers get to make that decision about a conversation with people talk to they have that power over free speech if you think of it as a free speech question it seems strange by\nIf as you said you think about the question the gab radicalized this person is gab bears some culpability and turn him into the person who did what he did then you reach a very different conclusion\n\nAs a libertarian how to use your said\nOh I mean my point of view as a libertarian as that is less you're talking about the government in the first amendment the free speech becomes a property rights issue\nSo I mean it is a good hosting providers conducted a website I don't know but there are hosting provider and they have the poverty right in this case they have the right to pool their service if they want to pull their service and they do have a powerful position being hosted providers\nUm but it's the same it's the idea of somebody came on these airwaves and said something within like we would hang up on them and probably dumped I'm not allowed on there\nI mean were hired by people if we say still they don't like it ... will get fired I mean it the free speech exist and I'm very much an ounce loose in the sense of the government should not be gone balls and strikes on that sort of stuff but when you're talking about the the whole fire in a crowded theater exception\nWill that sold the property right like when you buy a ticket you're essentially agreeing I'm going to sit and watch the movie and not disturb other people and so wide enjoyment exactly\nSo I I I really ... it comes down to me or if I was hosting running those things I Do generally personally I'm not greatly offended by things and people were just saying them not your motive offenders who has some very difficult to even other than\nLike if you're talking about very violent acts and nasty I'm dehumanization of people and I'm not talking about oh somebody said something I mean\nI mean if you're talking about I'm going to go to this and us this place at this time and kill people or I'm going to kill this group of people are I Want to add that double offend me but um most of the time if you are making a terrible joke saying something emotional and angry um direct\nI as a conservative you know if you're a whenever platform your own at that person owns ... performance layers and does not give you the ability to do whatever you want to do during the freedom of speech than I think the platform you can vote\nAnd I noticed I noticed is that came out talking about\nPeople getting news sources that are more and they're kind of opinion of what they're looking for him ... points where you can communicate to people that you have like mind and that those are becoming independent and I think they were going to give 'em Facebook and some ... some people a problem because\nThey've already said that and you're going to get to the side of the interview with the Trump campaign manager he's concerned that they are not going to have digital access free access to certain platforms because of who they are now\nOkay so this was a certain part of the story here I didn't find hard it is difficult to identify hate speech and I agree with that\nA question about whether you can be radical online\nOnline has already been supported by our government that we believe that after nine eleven when people had access to\nISIS supporters and those were trying to radicalize Jeff isolated individuals' we know now that Facebook Twitter and YouTube all have agreed with that and have worked with the government can take a lot of these videos down why not when it comes to right or left wing extremist on line\nWell for one is very hard it's hard to identify what is extremism it's hard to identify what exactly is hate speech words are very complicated and different context in a particular case of Bowers yeah it's very easy to identify what he was doing he should have been found that should have been taken down but as a general principle\nIt's very difficult to identify what his hate speech what is not hate speech and just that\nSo it was as difficult and I agree with that I think it is if we go to a to do that and this guy is pretty good at a kind of explaining to sound like this kind of thought\nYou know concept of this so I didn't find hate speech but when when when I was seeing other people on the Internet is a responsibility and then let's discuss\nI mean here that that ... which is the Anti Defamation rolled found at least four point two million anti Semitic tweets were shared or we shared an English on Twitter over a twelve month\nPeriod you know how to you know yes Nick is when you say hate speech is hard to identify online how was that hard to identify\nHate speech while hate speech is complicated right because you look for a specific words and you look for the context in which those words were said so worth it can be attacking one group when said by a member of that group can actually be affirmative right so it's very hard to identify what is\nAn actual hate statement what is a lyric what is something that can be positive ... hate speech is actually the technical problems with social media companies have hit is the hardest in a case like ... hours yeah\nYeah take that guy off line and if the platform is to find them you can see why they want to apply for my wife got to look\nVery closely and read in detail which we can't do in this plane flying I look at the trail between with ours we're seeing on line and\nOn TV about the caravan believing that it was caused by Jews and supported by high and that's when he'd been treated screw your optics I'm going in there is a trail that actually it wasn't even worse than our corner this guy doesn't and he's like yeah\nIt's set by politicians I I feel like it's even worse than X. I feel like not only does he get radicalized he gets some affirmation imposed on going in because he wants people to like that there is something wrong with that platform of that happening\n\nOkay so he's saying that the caravan as being funded by the Jews and he said that he said that on his\nPost\nBut it was people kind of mixing and things together did do they actually have proof that he did that\nWell and gab I was just reading up with more on this or this alternative and it's mostly All right because a lot of the right people to banned from Twitter 'em and gab is not necessarily the people running aren't necessarily all ride and apparently after this happened\nThey deleted this man's account but they kept all the data as Dan backed up and said that a meal into the form of justice and FBI\nSo they were cooperating mentally and they said that we will not we stand for free speech and individual liberty but we will not stand for violence and and violent threats and this is not what we want at all but as they were playing for them and their condition right but apparently that wasn't good enough for\nGo daddy of for another company that was open them ... and for\nA pay pal may pay pal pulled and won't allow well there's a gab to use pay pal\nSo and a lot of these companies are saying they're terms of service allow them to\nPull the their service for whatever\nReason as we were talking of ah my that ten page or do that [laughter] that you say yes to and that uh [noise]\nBut there are some extended to that I mean if you do in the business is actually go down and you're buying a domain them taking away the domain of the day was within our rights well then I mean there's so many social car\nNews having to find ... we can take their car back anytime we won't have any reason well not necessarily I think there's a good faith the transaction that happens here to the phones and go to Rodney Rodney welcome aboard\nA man a very good yeah\nI'm a while we and and uh I mean I don't know what\nBut um it\nYou know which was what's wrong with this is we've got enough tragedies that are happening and then uh we got the you know political party is a a media and and they all run around and act like they don't know what a speech is they've been eight my president says he walked in the office\nEvery word they view their mouths they uh insightful multiply it\nAnd it's time for America to be better off with this and I think America is better it's not that we've just disgusted with the things that have taken place but we're not stupid enough to not know what was\nGoing on and the media is got us nervous all I can say it's got the nerve to the biggest hate speech and a insiders that you can uh you know you could point out today\nAnd so we have multiple problem things happening but they're not going to ban marathon going into an election year an act like there's some kind of innocent party and all of this people need to remember what the media is doing\nAnd the ACLU what Trump is fake media they going to say what they want they drive and I'm a political party is what they do and they incite paid\nWell and they do is here here's my problems away they're presenting information and it is is painted in the new Kenya words around too and it gives it a different meaning that there was talking to the subject\nThat actually is out there but do change you know the knees or freedom loving people coming in the Caribbean and do their job will be people that are going to be new the new there's no proof that there's any type of criminal element in there will there is you just watch Fox in interviews that is going to do with\nAttempted manslaughter ... homicides that there were\nI mean but there's some you know all the things but the money coming out of war and some people funding all this stuff to issue to issue we had a tragedy is going on but then I sit here and I listen to the media and and and it just makes mistakes because they really think we're does too\nAnd it's a sad day in the morning but yet the media sister and and just carries on like we're stupid\nAnd they going to uh you know try to marry everything and to what a midterm election\nHim and they were doing it for the benefit them between religion\nAnd that's been saying what about the American people they were about America and we're about anything else and that's the problem\nYeah and they knew the media is beside themselves in this midterm election day or\nThat everything that they were reporting known shaping around the midterm election if you look at it was just as soon as you know shooting whether it's the bomber or where Trump isn't going where he is going and they have everything is centered on the bed too much and they're they're\nThey're really really worried\nOh yeah I went off the bus back at is that when uh they were talking about oh no oh I Know something that would help out there now but it never a wiretap tail\nIs go back a long way America America I think that it brought to make a booth than I Am I'm open a set of removing the direction of making America great again and keep on solutions because I really believe in that so uh I think that um I'm I'm really hoping and praying that the way it turns out I got a strong inkling that it is\nAnd I if I if that happens I think we have the time of uh of America where we live in a time in America where America it's been a born again\nRussia though I'm\nCloser now are you know you you know where I'm at on all of this body else knows what are you at all\n\nYeah I Will wound the

really won in the middle east\nSo I'm I'm kind of doing a wait and see what Trump right now the pressure is certainly on Iran as you just know to what the stock market\nBut in those early what Iran is going to do is like is it or the Saudi Arabians going to be good partners things heat up and the ... in Syria get\nI just don't know whether they're killing the journalists right everything's good like it just the middle east is can founded the last few presidents so right now I think it's a place to the base and sense of Trump\nBuilding promise they ripped up the actually can go back to Nixon brain OPEC was formed right it's I mean that the middle east has been a thorn in our side in the nation side for a while we part of that as us getting in the middle of it but\nIt's kind of a combination of religious issues that are there in the ... between the Muslims and Jews and the question is are there then you have oil or as a major and then you have the fact that you're dealing with these monarchs in it I mean\nYou know go back to is to Lawrence of Arabia timeframe I mean basically the house of ... D was created and they basically took seven tribes and but the them together under I'm under sued or in a creative Saudi Arabia and\nIs that is really a good movie to go back and really kind of get a feel for what that was like 'cause it's very very accurate of what was happening and you you're seeing the future kings and things of Saudi Arabia and they're finding the British and basically trying to get him out of there\nAnd I'm Wondering I Do wonder what this Iranian official is what he means by their own response to their own measures\nThey these guys are\nYou know they're they're really in a new type program would they do is they have a lot of bravado that they throw out there but\nUm [noise] you know they had no cattle type thing [laughter] but um [noise]\nThey they have a fledgling army that made it a military this layer but compared to us but they can certainly um clicks I'm a damage out there [noise]\nSo when you get that when a taking care of seeing kind of see what these guys are similar thorn in the side so Andrew McCarthy who's a former U.S attorney a southern district of New York he's going to be talking about Rosenstein and the hearing that was off and now may be own there may be public\nRosenstein calling off to a meeting on Capitol Hill last week avoiding questions about those reports that he wanted to secretly record the president now one lawmaker revealing we may all be getting ads\nThis is more likely going to be a public hearing uh we're a more members of Congress will be able to ask or some of the questions that I just raised a directly to the deputy attorney general I don't think it's likely to happen in the next week before the midterm but uh I Know that uh you know hopefully the sooner the better\nHe wanted thirty minutes and just on that twenty Fifth Amendment who did not want other questions and he was going to get them\nAnd the way is Fox contributor and former U.S attorney Andy McCarthy I Andy are you surprised rise Rosenstein punted and what do you think he's up to well I'm not surprised he punted I thought the you know we're due respect to representative right close to say that uh\nOne of the reasons that was put off his that he he Rosenstein didn't realize that the question was going to be about the Russia investigation I mean you know what do you think they want to talk to them about the weather of course he knew it was about the Russia investigation he's trying to put this off a\nAs he has been beyond them in terms and then the idea will be Brian ... if the Democrats take the house people will say the Justice Department will say no point in having a big hearing during the lame duck session of Congress and then the Democrats will be running the place and they won't be hearing\nMorrow got a damn bone Chino series of cuts that are you going to be absolutely\nFascinated with I couldn't get a two to it today because I wanted to get that morning show peace out there so you guys get here that are approaching and bases so Andrew McCarthy is going to be talking about by a\nAnd then he's going to give you a little piece of information on Europe let me do this I'm going to a break come back so to speak with Andrew McCarthy former U.S\nAttorney from southern district of New York [noise]\nDannemora show\nSource a anytime I see him own I'm always going to pay attention to the made in my opinion is that good [noise] okay\nNow down to some nuts and bolts type things and this is the uh the current campaign manager for Trump twenty twenty who was of old things was on CBS this morning and\nI was pretty uh pretty impressed with this guy he was the digital guy pro Trump twenty six chain that was considered to be a really brilliant piece of the operation that so there\nBut he he does this this interview and part of the interview is that they had to play a thirty second commercial about\nThe mid term election coming up he got them to do to agree to that so for doing this interview you say you know do the interview but you had to play the commercial\nWhat is this so I guess is Trump's so couldn't rubs up on your more you hang around with a beer and it's just sitting in\nThe president's upcoming schedule is built around a final campaign coach for Republican candidates before the midterm elections he will hold rallies in Florida, Missouri and West Virginia later this week It's MORNING President Trump's campaign is launching a six million dollar advertising push\nBrad ... scale is President Trump's twenty twenty campaign manager and it's here to talk about the elections as part of the book and grim and we agreed to show thirty seconds of an ads focused on the economy\nAnd we\nWere we even more slowly than we\nThings starting [noise]\n... and the ones that matter [noise]\nWe can't get distracted from the biggest issue which our job and are you at all though\nIf we don't know\n[noise]\nAlso served as the digital director for Mr Trump's twenty sixteen campaign welcome to the table bad\nDriving here I got to say is it's very humble for me to be growing up watching CBS going up in rural Kansas somebody's and things and then she'll be sitting at this table\nOh the president said get out and twenty Eighteen because you're voting for me so why is he not in the ad\nWell look right now there's been terms this about holding the house and going to leave the Senate the president's not on the ballot but this is about his agenda and it's about the America First agenda and what he's accomplished in two years and this ad says\nCan't go back that it's important to get out and vote\nThings that have um change in the last two years that they can simply go away and we need to get the Republican\nOkay so here's the kind of boring to question you remember I was talking about micro messaging when he goes into one of these words he said he kinda owns or into a media market as bleeding over into sober red states don't Trump is carrying one message\nI've been driving it drives me nuts 'cause he's trying to get that base excited to get out and go and vote and that's why we're seeing these momentum indicators doing so well and particularly when you get down by state\nThey they're wanting wanting some numbers and then I think they're missing something because they're under waiting Republicans and under waiting independence which are actually the largest group so would they have to do is to have a general misery says going out and talking to everybody in these areas\nSo they will kind of get the bigger message we don't want to go back in time they did it almost like an apple commercial when you're talking about things have changed because of of apple computers coming in and it was kind of this voice that the female voice you know kind of\nTalking about how we transition from one type of economy to another and we don't want to go back it was very effective very effective\nSo now he's going to get into this and he's going to be talking about the general message to it that was just talking about versus the micro message which he's not even mentioned but that I had clearly saying\nAbout the ads says that but the president says and he has some weight in the political conversation with his voters he says it's about caravans and Kavanaugh's which\nIs not about the economy yeah well it's about every ... things are getting better and there's still things we have to get done and if we don't hold the house we don't increase early in the Senate will change just can't keep coming and to deal with immigration laws and deal with the things in the problems we still have to make this country even safer and better\nWe have to have the Republican Party um in power and I think the president without that you know the fight turns into obstruction it seemed like he makes your job hard\nAre really kind of mean hunter and the ad itself says don't get distracted he is very good at distracting the conversation from what you're trying very hard here to keep it all focused\nOn well what they call me also still with legal immigration you know I think right now is you see 'em it's getting tougher to get in this country in some ways we're starting to see unemployment go down and I think what's happening is you're seeing wages increase in that's making people's lives better so they're all tied together to try to put one of these pieces of the single issue that somehow separated us it's not true what does a lot\nIt's typical I'm sixty seconds to try and put every message out there yeah and it's expensive to buy advertising on those channels on what we want to do as much as possible for people to see things were not so good not that far back but I have to ask you about it\nAs soon as the phones ... ... what was it in ...\nA man who you know\nI'm ... have you heard that commercial\nUm talks about Medicaid Medicare and Social Security being caught and then it goes on and says if the Republicans when we as a society as you're saying\nThat I haven't seen that I also notice yesterday there were\nSigns on the side of the road that said vote Democrat or die\n[laughter] I'm sure I'm dead serious I'm Serious in they're in democratic areas\nAnd there's other lives just all generic the boat boat or die\n[noise] humor is who runs out I had for the Democrat um\nNo I don't I'll be honest with ya ever every time I see that I I Am so shocked I never get far enough here who actually put it on\nA plane alone things on Facebook last couple of days in fact there was one of President Obama giving seven reasons I'm\nCovered excuses for not voting and disgusting\nThe saying it it is so laughable eight eight eight talks about all the things he accomplished empire to what all of the things that Trump has done a did\nYeah it's a yeah I watched Joe Scarborough when it comes to present a liar I Wish you would take time out to take something that broke Obama says and and kind of look and see whether Barack Obama's line or not\nYeah it's [noise] it's it's really disheartening to see the stock market drop as much as it is in China the old at first I thought it was democratic manipulation\nAnd then I kind of realized it's not democratic and manipulation it's most people are scared of the Democrats actually being voted in\nYeah could be aware there's there's been some discussion out here in the ... good example today the stock market was a two hundred and eighty three points now is down three hundred and eighty eight boys has six hundred and sixty point turn around\nAnd we've had some big swings and there is some

I guess with the advent of the midterm and all that\nThat makes sense now this a ride up and it was kind of a provocative headline that the young are better than the older the to see what his fact what is not the right\nWhat what ... research actually did is they had ... people across the generations just say is this a factual statement\nLike at a statement of fact or is this an opinion\nSo separate once a statement of opinion suffering from what does a statement of fact uh and it found that younger people were better at that then people say fifty five it up\nAnd what they said is here's the breakdown it's how they got the news\nAnd that was interesting to me that because younger people are mostly getting their news from reading stuff online there quicker when they're reading a questionnaire to get okay that's somebody giving their opinion that somebody's stating a so called fact as opposed to the older generation is mostly getting their news from\nTelevision and talk radio in particular talk radio has been big because we mix factors opinion ...\nWe actually you know have fun with it I just I thought it was interesting that sometimes you\nNeed and what you thought about that the people can't ... it wasn't so much these are the facts and and you're just to have an opinion man it's more gay differentiate between somebody has an opinion and somebody saying something that's either true or not\nI don't know it gets mixed up and I think I actually appreciate being part of talk radio world because I think the real were the wrong road is when you start\nApplying the facts\nI think the problem we have today with fact and opinion isn't so much with the radio it's with schools\nEvery day there are stories about assignments and and and stuff and and what what's being taught in classrooms that's because you you ... what's the line\nOpen to receive what what I think it's from an eagles so we are programmed to receive [noise] yeah I think that's what's going on in schools and then they graduate and there's enough time passes what they were taught and but there's\n[laughter] you know when my\nWife was out in town and the kids were out diamond went into the

blaming everybody Greg\nEverybody's damned fault\nNot just one leader that later our political leaders have led us to this moment where people the rhetoric so heated that they're killing people and sending bombs in the mail\nI Can't just blame the leaders I got to pick on the people who put the leaders there and that's the American people they should look in the mirror or really we could blame individuals hold them personally responsible for their violent actions\nThat's unique concept yeah but it's it's not that then I'm blaming everybody I'm Sorry the amped up rhetoric begins with\nNetworks and I don't see the insanity on Fox or you know you know the hate what have I mean they never they always say that never give an example give me one example of something hate driven at

the country yeah in that okay with regards to\nResponsibility of controlling narratives yet to answer your question directly I think the person doing the provoking is worse okay yes but you see what I'm doing here I just get so tired of that pass the buck pass the buck passes by at a certain point where the idiots fallen for this crap right\nIt ... it just at the beginning of what you were saying it almost sounded dangerously close to being like one of those people in Pittsburgh shouldn't have been Jewish or oh good God enough but I see what you're saying now and that makes a very good point\nIs that we keep falling for these uh ideas and ... it's almost like we want to be provoked like the idea of the Russians you know influence the election was bots on Facebook\nAnd Twitter like no doubt they had these bought farms that people who are paid to go and stir things up right in whatever way but at the end of day it comes down to don't be mark for that sort of stirring up\nLike you at a certain point the best defense against this is not by restricting speech\nAnd it's certainly not by having Facebook or Twitter you to be the policemen of it\nYeah I mean that that's a little concerning but at the same time it's like I get it I mean as a company you wouldn't want to yeah you wouldn't want to limit that one companies that are hurting free to have all sorts of standards I'm fine with that I actually I prefer companies doing that then the government I think that\nAll day every day I prefer that but some of these standards that covered is set up are a bit slippery they're not they're not enforced in a very clear an even handed way yeah\nAnd you definitely see this with YouTube's DMCA program right it's not run by people anymore it's not run by robots and so the huge companies like you could posted video\nA like a collage of pictures as a video and\nLike queen and the background it'll get DMCA didn't like fibroids exactly\n... ridiculous and they're trying to do it because their billions of videos on there right\nAs soon as you can't do it just people but I don't know my my long convoluted point is we have to accept individual responsibility for things actually on the stall warning call out things like this terrible evil that happened this weekend but we're not\nYou know I've I follow a few I'm I'm not like oh I have a lot of Jewish friends but I mean I Do follow a lot of libertarians aligned weapon to be Jewish right and they were some pretty heartfelt stuff\nAbout how they felt when they saw this news breaking and the common trend was don't the people who are often you know what is it a shaving cream poster for crap posters I Can't say the actual word yeah people just troll ... people up on line kind of drop that pose\nTo because I Am a Jew\nPlease do not use this as a political football please\nAnd I'm so several people say please do not use as a political football I mean if they get they get enough yeah and it's being used as a political football\nI I did see a guide a jump out or it's um for the New York post\nHe wrote something saying that you know actually what the shooter shooting reminds me of is that it's it's very good to be an American if you're a Jew\nGoing all the way back to the founding of the country to coach George Washington\nTalking about how to centrally this nation allows every person to have their own space if they want\nIncluding the children of Abraham\nAnd it's a pretty beautiful quote and the guy says the difference between what happened this weekend and what's happening throughout most of history as it wasn't a group of people blaming the Jews and take him out it was one guy\nYeah and most people in this country of course we all went back and kind of was horror for taking a back\nYou know I I read some of the things that got posted\nI didn't anybody be like this is the dumbest stuff I've ever read like when he when he mentioned taking over the country right I was\nI was confused as to how either on such a small demographic because people were doing that yeah I mean he mentioned there's a lot of nonsense out there that he mentioned white people\nAnd how he was like going to protect them\nIt's dumb as far as I Know aren't most choose white\nI'm not necessarily I mean I don't I I see all that and for no bananas like white noise to me it's like an addict noise in a sense of I guess technically user different then historically have been treated differently than say your wasp\nPopulation right and I mean they're old there's a history especially in this country of race especially the like black white distinction is really a class distinction\nSo there are books about like when the Irish come over when the Jewish population start coming over or they're like classified as black as excuse the word negro\nApparently that's why you see a lot of um Irish names\nThem black families yes it's because they were they ended up grouping them together because they got this is so weird to say they considered the Irish to people out and write\nIt it's very much a a class thing in this country race has always been a class thing more because if you look into the science of like race it's nonsense like yes there is such a thing as biology and genetics you no doubt but to say okay this\nAs a race every time somebody has done that it's usually always nonsense\nIt's although it is probably easier to control\nPeople's reactions when grouping\nYeah by something that is\nFeeding a typically observable that has to say skin color than it would be to do it by class right\nNow and it's unique to this country because if you go to other places and they have and let me be clear there's always been like class race ethnic division\nAnd it keeps popping up so it's a thing human beings do right it was the basis of it I'm not denying that discrimination along racial or ethnic or whatever lines\nIt usually exist like if you look at old translations of ancient names people had for themselves like a ... ... Americans were kind of you know saying we're Americans because of the geography we're living in America\nBut if you look at old ancient people a lot of times they're the translation of their tribes name like\nWe're the Joey papal Joey would translate to where the real people or we're not those people over there over that ... it's a very much a self selecting like we are in a good group or ... where's the good people\nThere's always a need for a scapegoat in human history so this stuff always exists but if you look at the basis for like why somebody says we're the real people were the same thing here the doubles and it there's the bases is bunk\nYeah it's us or not us right and it's it's ...\nYou want to be us when good happens and you want to be you don't want to be not us when the bad happens one maybe that's what's going on now is that we have instant communication instant contact and that whatever it is about human beings maybe we can not blame the people blame all your let's just\n... human nature to quote Michael Jackson why does he do me that way that's just human nature but\nIt maybe it's that that need to say I'm we're veering chosen few and all the rest are Dan's room enough for an hour for you we don't want to have an ... that idea that we are the right side you're the bad side us versus them that\nWhatever causes human beings to do that ... group into tribes is now being played out on a massive and ... instantaneous scale outline perhaps than this is just briefly\nThinking about trying to come up with a name for how we can be better at it will call it I don't know enter subjective hygiene sure social media hygiene there we as people can be better much better\nAt how we communicate with others\nFail to see a lot of posts on line\nOr I see a lot of people communicating things in such a way where if they were face to face that\nInteraction would never occur\nWhere I Am absolutely\nBut I also see an interaction that when that occurs that it would be like if it's like you and me and high school and we're talking some crowded about another individual from\nThat would just be a personal communication between you and I I see that also being moved on line and being able to be viewed by more than just the people in the conversation\nCenters no context there's and also imagine folks all the ...
