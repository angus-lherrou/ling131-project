[laughter]\nBut anyway conspiracies and consumption okay there's conspiracies of all kinds there's conspiracies of what causes the market to drop mhm and we do know that the market is all geared in on consumption mhm consumption of what of goods\nConsumption of goods is what drives the market in other words if you didn't consume\nBut some but people build up reserves because they had ... consuming right cry and is that in his a patient sometimes a building up those reserves and then you have a consumption collapse ooh that just sounds had words the consumption didn't consume it just stopped\nSo say we're talking about uh I don't know why ... there's going to be a big old stockpile of um nobody ball right and what would that do that would drive the price down when do you think I think it would and then you think people would start consuming then\nYeah they probably when they when it gets down to ... nothing I hey that's getting cheap enough that we can build their reserves back ... but by then you just lost all your light bulbs you if you were the person who was re telling them you just\nHad to give 'em away it's just that then that stinks I just messes up your stuff yeah it's just\nA bad kid you might as well go into the consumption of the old times you know in the olden days\nIf you had cancer or if you had a tuberculosis ... are you know like lung cancer door closes or ... or ... long fibrosis they didn't know these things they didn't know any of these kind of terminology is are these ... these diagnosis so to say what did they died of\nAnd the old time a doctor said well they just dont of consumption\nAnd the thing was since they had a you know lumped in there with cancer and a tuberculosis I mean you you can catch tuberculosis is so they would think anybody that had consumption you need to get away from yeah let them you know go home because if you catch yourself right and I don't think you can catch cancer from anybody\nWell that's debatable I don't know uh probably not but uh\nThe I mean they don't really know everything there's things that are genetically connected to cancer ... and\nSo it would be like almost a pre destination if you got in contact with a might be a chemical or something in your environment that would cause you to get cancer they don't really know but they have these there's some cancers\nThat you have cancer markers and if you have that marker mhm then you're like Seventy eighty Ninety percent chance of whatever it may be a ... you come down with the cancer\nAnd so it is genetic and he is environmental can it be that you catch it from somebody\nHere is how he could be caught from someone\nThere in the seventies when I was in college studying biology and they were talking about insertion of viruses into the genetic makeup of the human in other words viruses inject\nA fragments of a of a bar in a\nInto you okay and and and and and so these things can be transcribe potentially I don't know I'm not an expert but I read a lot and so when they does transcription or if it raised the genetic code\nIt has been inserted from some virus potentially so maybe you caught it from your your parents caught it and then gave it to you we don't know everything mhm we don't know these kind of thing so can you catch cancer\nMaybe\nI did I never thought about that well I mean these are just things that are out there that they don't know ... they have they have a series they have a policies but they don't know they don't know but there's one thing we do do\nWe know why it goes up comes down I've heard that it's that a gravity thing I think yes and we know that you don't want to have the face of a clown\n[laughter] not all the time it's kind of scary you know children do you know how many children get scared when a clown\nComes around a lot of them and I never realized I never realized how bad children are fried clams I have got this little granddaughter and she is so afraid of clams her mother was afraid to ... my daughter uh-huh she's afraid the clouds she don't lock up my wife don't live ... ...\nHow things could be if you just let things lay around you don't want to not have your plans made ... the worst thing to do is to do nothing right you want to be able to discern Harris some of your unsavory relatives\nAnd yes one of them is running around with his beard is Seventy six on his sleeve and he's got a beard he's got a hat you get this here at this inherit him because he is scary is that the ... to the children because he'll be standing there with his hand out\nAnd the other hand in your pocket probably so you need to why he loves them oh yeah man you can't get rid of me and you go to a family reunion everybody knows who he is oh yeah have you seen Uncle Sam and he's one of their put and potato salad in his pocket yeah 'cause I used to have an uncle that used to put cigarettes with his pocket\nLike a bum cigarettes from people yeah I mean this man had more money than anybody I mean\nYeah I mean he he would go ... they ... they say well if he if he took a cigarette he'd said hey can I have a cigarette if you take a break and he was he had a good job or people to give them a cigarette and he'd put it out and throw it in his shirt puck he was well known for this he saved everything and he accumulated\nSort of like marmaduke I guess so so what did he do he had done roller lighter and rolling down the leader of just smoke that cigarette I guess I don't know what he did with our guest they've just smoked\nAnd I just put it out but it is ... ... because he is going to save it for another time and then and then the but the thing is we put that cigarette and go to another person asking\nFor ... I was a I was at a large local retailer last week uh-huh and there was this man and woman in front of me and they were just a\nLamenting over the fact that co pays to get your drugs and get your a doctor visits the co pays just too hot too hot they are and then he asked for a carton of cigarettes\nYeah fifty one dollars for a carton of cigarettes and they paid and he paid\nAnd ah I quit when they got to be a dollar and a quarter pack I'll just say this is probably smoking oh trashy cigarettes out smoking\nI went down to also get something I don't like and it all makes stopping okay yeah I've done under smoking or do route menthol yeah you know and and I got a dollar and a quarter pack I said no more\nI Know it sounds like I'm Still smoke in this is awful\nYeah they'll just a meal [noise] can't drink their [noise] me me me me I think he'd been hanging with that guy with a beer too low I Know I'm starting to sound like him but anyway I'm speaking of cigarettes my [noise] my grand pappy\nThink I've done this before he sent me down to ... get a guy that owns the store where ... you get the cigarettes with no stamps and a bomb from the Carolinas the result trucks running about twenty miles an hour all white bootleg bootleg\nAnd they'd be like twenty cents a pack this is like in sixty seven or eight or something like that twenty cents a pack\nI remember and they didn't have any stamps on and they were in ... by these lucky strikes no\nThey send me down and getting the thing is if you don't believe that there's this thing called inflation huh\nTwenty cents a pack pack of cigarettes costs now I don't know but uh\nYeah buttons yeah but somebody was primary or general about six dollars which [noise] I don't doubt it because\nUh I think there's ten packs a carton\nAnd seven and had fifty one dollars for the way he got yeah well anyway if you\nListen to say that the average person had to pay more than twenty says I don't know what it was my because he had them with they'll stamps on them probably probably were thirty or forty cents on reality yeah so how many time with thirty cents go into seven dollars Mm I didn't know there'd be any my uh that's me get my twenty twenty to get my only something times okay\nSo since the late sixties if you had a dollar now you've got to have twenty dollars or twenty five dollars or my dad\nHe sent me to the store when when I was kid I'd probably six or seven years old ride my bicycle up to the store you know being a bad you know ... and he would give me fifty cents\nAnd I would get I get him a pack of cigarettes and me and my brother's candy so you know that tells you one thing right there first off and then then they would ... to minor\nAnd then how much that calls\nBut uh I mean a lot of things were different oh a lot of things without it from there they're just will not even the candy them and you get two or three pieces of for a penny back then and we were just happy birds you know yeah but ah cigarettes are and ... I think most of what you see a lot on cigarettes\nAnd gasoline is tax that's right now I mean a lot of I don't know what the base price for anything is one of my life\nIs a lot of time if you go down to Florida ... against us more expensive there than it here's an Alabama because why their taxes are higher yeah if you go to other states\nLike when I went to California not too long ago I noticed that their their their gas was like a dollar a dollar and a half more ... and I've noticed how in the past sometimes there was a two dollars now\nSometimes you get a ... when we get into this gas crisis periods of times we've had people tried to gouge you oh yeah\nAnd that's that's what happens in crises you get gouged\nIn a crisis of the stock market you're going to get gouged ... if you're retired you got to pull the money out you're going to get gouged if he retired you got to depend on that money is going to get gouged you've got to have gas mileage prove retirement\n... proof\nAnd it can be gouged prove\nThere's things that can be guaranteed don't be deceived there are guarantees on retirement accounts that grow really nice when we're not in a ... ... times and the gouging ...\nYou're safe and ... his against the law\nYou know what I mean really if you got somebody is active but I Do and that that kind of get that kind of get a but the stock market gouging is not against the law you know it can ... well I was going on for like ... why don't you know what I maybe it is and some forms ... look at look at that guy that gives everybody and said he had a portfolio when he didn't\n... a Bernie made off oh yeah ... Bernie made off with a made on your feet bite off with it now he's over in the big house yeah making buddies living rocks out of big rocks yeah yeah but he but for years and years Bertie made off mhm you know you don't want to be on the backs of a ...\nSo you got to make sure that whatever you do I don't like using things they don't have something back um insurance companies or governments something lacking this thing up for that that was the whole deal in Nineteen twenty nine\nOh they were they were low you could buy into the stock market\nBut a lot of people had borrowed money\nTo buy into the stock market and they were making a lot of money but then you know the the the the stock market failed and people were calling him their options is is that is that right yeah\nCause they were calling in their ... their option 'cause yeah they borrowed against it well Marja new data in other words they borrow against their stock to buy more stock stuff like that and then they and then they flew the coup a lot of them because they had to laugh when it was bad they were flying out the window via or because they knew that Peter had to pay the piper and they didn't have\nThe ... and Paul nowhere to be found in power now would be\nThe thing is you don't want to be in the situation when you're retiring or getting near retirement to be like that you still have to grow I mean I'm not against the young people this message is not for you this message is not for young people the message for young people is take risk\nListen to the four oh one K. people [noise] um and and and do it go aggressively but as you get older\nYou better come see somebody like me because you will be in a heck of a mess if this thing does what it normally does when it gets this high I don't know what is going to do I have no where is the idea was going to happen but I Know this if I were you\nAnd I had built up some money and you say well I only got fifty thousand dollars only got a hundred thousand dollars how long did it take you to get there you fifty years old you're sixty years old you're ... years or do you want to lose half of it I mean I don't I wouldn't want to lose ... based on whether it'll come back\nYeah I Know when we come back I Know you might be eighty or Ninety who knows this message is not for people that are in the growth range this message is for people who have grown their money and are getting within the next ten years ready to\nPull in the towel and Thomas laid back and have a good life without having to worry about things bad happening ...\nJust sit out by the pool relax with that code right with the umbrella who say to yourself\nOr to pull people do and today I Wonder you know that kind of say yes to and you can do that but you have to get somebody on your side is going to guide you through all these winding roads to financial freedom and that person is David Ernest\nBeen doing it for Thirty years called him up to seven ... seven for three one and he will try and I'm sure he can help you\nSo\nI think the message is probably getting clearly through that we are protectors of the portfolio\n[noise] no absolutely not a law actually an sort of surprised it took this long for a cure of and like this to assemble the fact is that you know we see these courts no constantly a hater bring the president's efforts to\nAh cut down on the number of people are coming across the border to detain individuals' that's your purpose and come to the United states is live and work in the United states\nAnd you get relief you've got ... you want it and it's a it's an incentive for those individuals to come to be not states we need to cut off his leg that's the president has attempted to do it but Congress has stepped up the task and [noise] you know frankly the polls is on them\nAnd I mean Congress can do a few basic things\nFairly quickly if it wanted to\nTo stop the magnet number one mandate e verify every employer must have e verify and it has to be enforced strictly with significant fines that's one thing they can do what are they are a few things could they do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the amount of detention that's available to the administration in order to detain these families that their cases to be heard quickly so that the good cases can be separated that circuit cases ... not lose folks could be returned United States but you can also uh you know\nChange the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico\nThat you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states but again\nYou keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate ...\nIf they do they should be applying for asylum Guatemala they should be applying for asylum let's hope but there are in addition ah the ah the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a rule where are the company daily in a miners have to be released after twenty eight days\nUm Congress can you know step in and they can end the floor is a settlement agreement or if they'd like but again they're afraid or judges\nRight they're afraid of being called mean spirited that's what they're afraid it doesn't matter if how many instances of hideous you know criminal acts had been committed by illegal aliens even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show doesn't matter\nFor them it doesn't matter it's it it's a it's an emotional manipulation game they want to they want to pull the heartstrings America and put these Republicans back on their heels says okay you want to put babies in cages you want to put babies how many times and we hear kids in cages\nIn ... we do separate children from adults very briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that\nIn order to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into\nThe past facilities that we have available Congress can provide more money for that but\nHere's really what it comes down to the trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous rapes robberies murders under the Obama administration when they had similar uh programs we saw NPR run articles about as we saw National Geographic of all things\nAre run an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore all you see is a little girl a pink shirt standing next to her mother crying is a border patrol agent make sure that her mother doesn't have any contraband that child traveled through the night without food\nHow in the world any parent can subjects their child but this horrendous journey to the United states is beyond me\nOf when you when you see these\nFour thousand people now just grows and grows and grows as caravan\nWho's paying for this I think there's no way when you have a per capita income of you know two thousand five hundred dollars and\nHonduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars a cost to get to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expect administration to be looking into that a lot of these people though are you know doing this because they believe that the that the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they're given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states for a very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably work in their favor at this is another incentive again went back to ... that people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their smugglers are definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states\nWe need mandatory either verify that the keys the kingdom but until we get to that point we need to change that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so those are the good cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum from Central America are denied it only five percent of those who are denied actually are ever going to leave the country is that the case is that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we're talking about you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God or in the United states under final orders for mobile they received their due process or it's not like they're waiting for their their their hearing everything that they had coming to them they've had\nBut they remain in the United states continue to work here again we have no ... no way\nTo verify that there are leading an\nIce chests lack of resources to go out and find once he's in Tuesday's or people\nPlus you you put on top of that the sanctuary laws places like California and localities where you know people under ... orders removal you know are apprehended by the police\nIt shows up on the raft sheet that they're under a final order removal and yet they get released a in back into society and they're not return to their home countries\nBut everybody needs to work together in order to make the system work\nWhen any one part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on a with me last night aren't and he said that the folks in uh\nYou know the MSNBC traveling reporter travels with the migrants\nHadn't been coached yet so all he said well look I Want to work in the United states in there and just no jobs here and\nNever mention anything about persecution and mark said well that's because he hasn't gotten to Mexico where all the coaching really occurs\nThat's where you get them yeah there's a paragraph that you have to say no matter what when when when authorities interview so the script for everybody man woman and child seems to be\nThe same and I fear for same for my family that I'm going to be killed by the gangs which is why sessions wants to remove domestic abuse and gang concern correct from the asylum a consideration\nHe already has done that through a land security bill I think it was attached to that bill yeah at but you know here's the other problem Lauren this is the next year that's going to drop about\nSeventy five Ninety percent of all people who claim credible fear found to have credible fear even though the asylum numbers are as well as you mentioned before the problem is that if people allege that they have suffered or fear or something\nThen\nUh they get referred over for torture convention claim back in Nineteen Ninety nine the Reno a Justice Department gave authority over a planes that are the convention against torture to immigration judges even though it might be years before an individual's removed from the United states\nDa chests needs to give that authority back to the Justice Department needs to give that authority back to the H. S. so that they can make determinations whether someone's going to be tortured white before the purse will leave the United states because that's really the critical point\nWell and also uh as as he or someone else made the point when someone claimed domestic abuse there is no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason it's horrible thing\nBut think about the people were going to be bringing into the country from all over the world it's is it while it's domestic abuse I'm afraid of domestic abuse it hasn't even been investigated in their home country how are people to investigate\nA local domestic violence concerns from an immigration proceeding in order to review in Texas or Arizona it's just ludicrous\nIt's even worse than that because there's a regulation and plays that actually prevents the United states government investigate it whether or not that claimed took place in the home country nothing that's contained asylum application can be disclosed to anyone outside of that asylum proceeding we'll leave very limited exceptions none of which would apply in those cases\nAre in the turned back at the border and that's the other thing we have to be able to expedite which means even to non contiguous countries or if you're from Guatemala we need to change the law doing not so we can do immediate border turned backs like we can with Mexicans\nYes and a under a the TV puree the trafficking victims protection that we have to actually a handover unaccompanied alien minors to a church as an agency or the department of the United states government really doesn't\nDo this for a for a living\nAnd yet you know Congress back in two thousand and two decided that ha ha I should have this responsibility and they don't do it very well\nPainting landscaping repairing any rotten wood will pay dividends and a better price and quicker sale here at the good some group we have a ten point plan of action to get your home so we're more information call your real estate sourced the good some group found found one zero two to five or email me\nBogus at charter dot net\nRiverside several a master control center says is W.

cost\nChina's moves votes as does the another issue which is important because I Believe\nUm in light of the Kavanaugh stop these numbers probably are even more important\nWhich is the when the argument that the Democrats if they take the house already many of them pledge\nAnd we now have their chairman the hum of there to be chairman actually win this year and comedy I'm sharing that are saying well we're gonna we're gonna impeach cabinet and we're going to impeach Trump we've got all these investigations a great belief that this will disrupt the economy\nAnd I'm a sense that um this is going to be Kay chaotic and that it is going to weaponize the constitution for the purpose of going after unpopular president whenever there and say we know that that's their agenda\nSomehow time had a couple of years to just to recap so you know from issues that would drive Republican turnout and maybe maybe even win over some Democrats\nDr ... yes but we'll move was a number of Democrats and many independents civil move in the third big issue of course is what the Democrats are doing the Democratic socialism or someone said to me uh you know the um them he says they now refer to them the Democratic can teach but ...\nI'm a party um uh\n[noise] and you know the repeal they promise to repeal every piece of ... or reject every piece of the president's economic policies\nUm which are booming for most people are at least\nMuch more positive than they haven't been in years um these issues in the sense of the Democrats are opting to out of the middle\nOne democratic socialism but the

imperative it seems to me\nThat those through what I call that prior to ... um the Democrats have healthcare and you're not going to take that away from ... to light 'em but ah my except for the fact that both the cost is because that goes again\nYou have a third of more Democrats who oppose the idea of the Democratic party trying to Institute\nA socially the Democratic socialism that bothers

practiced statistical journalism um\nAnd he you know he didn't get the ... and twenty sixteen uh but this time he's saying people should not be that surprised by a Democratic Senate\nOr a Republican House where in dangerous territory from a predictive assumption standpoint he set of four and five chance may sound like a done deal but it's simply isn't a and he said it's it just because someone thinks\nSomething as a high probability it might be but it doesn't mean it's\nLet Republicans lose the house and no one isn't enough about it maybe it's likely historically but it's not inevitable and I think that's what a lot of Republicans have to get through their heads\nYes this is why it's still hanging um I I agree with that looks very hard to predict the business environment because you don't know what's going to drive this thing at the end\nWe have the selection this there are many many things that are under law in this election most of all by the way is one like the Trump and

I'm thirty eight we've got a good amount of time to be putting into our\nUm different column even count you know I guess my question is should we go ahead and and take the distribution pale all of our debt about one or longer and the um you know the interest rate or should we go at it hated that down and we are\nIn it will be there for the winter when we're well\nWe've been using for almost Thirty years a decision making paradigm a decision making structure that is based on the idea of what is the fastest way to well what is the shortest distance the wealth and\nI'm In the process what little in other words what gives us the greatest returns and what give what gives us the least risk what what has a level of wisdom to it um and it's not just one sided it's not all investing mine that it's not all\nThat mind it is not anything it's just a process of financial planning process that process has now been proven obviously doing it for twenty five years and many many people become millionaires and multi millionaires gradually not get rich quick using that process\nUm then the question becomes do you guys were you agree to use that process and if you're just so that the way I Would answer the question obviously me being me is I'm going to tell you use that process and that will answer your question what to do with the money [noise] but\nUm but you've got a first aside do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here what the process is based on the process is called the baby steps and what it's based on is a couple of things number one you're most powerful wealth building tool is your income\nAnd freeing up your income and not having that not only lowers risk not only increases the peace and the quality the relationship in the household but it also increases mathematically freeze up all of your income just to make money with instead of giving it to banks\nAnd uh and the second part of the things driving the process is is that personal finance is eighty percent behavior it's only twenty percent had knowledge stuff we're talking about smell really rocket science here\nThere's not a lot to the math it's it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is so having said that we say baby step one save a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that too is to be dead free everything but your house you not done that\nThree years to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses I didn't hear that you've done that and then force you don't have that for start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about who\nIrritants was not on the table or we would teach you to do stuff like that down to twenty four through the uh or take twenty four twenty five and throw it at the vet and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for you to have Seventy five dollars in debt with a two hundred thousand dollar household income it was just ready to bash or your\nLife or a couple of months ago and I'm a went on a on a knife in their nights waiting and then I remember on him right probably going to go wherever that\nOkay it's absurd that you make two hundred thousand dollars a year and you know twenty five dollars and that\n... ... ... you know you guys make enough money to have done this the right way you\nChose not to do it the right way so it's up to you guys but if you're going to do what we teach you know you would use this inheritance immediately to become debt free so that\nYou take all those payments that you don't have any more and you use those to build wealth with Eva paid for home\nCorrect we when I heard it when you are\nOkay All right and how much is in the inheritance in cash\n[noise] I I'm not quite ... look on my north of February ...\nA hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars correct okay and why she taking distribution says they're just taking it\nUm ... we want her financial grant or told her that she had to do it in a debate to um [noise] um the cover her pack a over the years that are here to hit hard over ... ... ... a good way to make money out of Vietnam yeah\nIt's a bunch of crap um the uh\nOkay because anytime you start making decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and get it invest it shot while when I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and I'm In a different financial advisor and uh\nI Would pay off all the debt and I'm going invest the rest of it or in something that I can see control and know what it is in good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something\nLike that I honestly don't think that's what you all are going to do but that's what I Would do um because\nI think there's a lot of cooks in this kitchen\nThere's a lot of opinions flying around here and you guys have got to get inside this end to as a couple decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do is show them telling you what to do and it's a different different situations so I think she inherited the financial advisor to\nI don't think he picked him and um and that's really a bad medicine\nAs well Ninety percent of the time are you guys need to pick them or do you need to re pick him and hiring again and this time he worked for you but I think he's still works for grandpa even ... dead and that's the way this stuff works usually bad bad medicine\nTravis what I Would do is catch the whole thing out pay off all my dad's and invest the money was what's left that's what I Would there and I would take your wonderful two hundred thousand or income and become multi millionaires with it and that's what we've shown people how to do for almost three decades now\nHold on I'll send you guys are a couple a copy of the book

I Believe that it would do is\nThey all went broke several years ago 'cause there was as emu fad and a bunch of people ... and then there was supposed to be there's a huge demand for the meat and it was basically a bunch of crap there was no demand for him ...\nAnd I'm pretty soon people just said daddy muse everywhere but I'm a you know alpacas I mean I I Know I'm not an expert on alpacas I'm not even an expert on ranches but from a business perspective I think you're entering a pretty narrow market\nAgreed with\nAnd you better really no your stuff and you better really do this you can't do it just 'cause you read some article about alpacas were making people rich those or not I mean any more than any more than cows are making people rich cows make people pretty poor all the time and some of them they make people rich\nBut as I as do other running a business uh called cattle you know and it was a business and when it ceases to be a business and starts to be a fad um or never

do you think before you buy a house [noise] um I'm thinking at least sixteen okay All right cool\nWell as long as you've got more than five years I Would use a simple gross stock mutual fund or a series of them for something like that I probably would ... be index fund\nBecause it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out I as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I've started to a\nPerson is and the five hundred fund an index fund and use that to grow for the next five ten years or so and do you buy a house as long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nAnd that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar things got in that sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment\nAnd um even if I don't have five years in that case I ride the market with it and I because I can afford for it to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robin is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve once up\nA thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick crack and uh so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a nurse and now that I'm Wondering if I should go back to school again next year\nI'm so my question is if they work for me to go to call now I'm thirty two years old my life\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now I'm a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand\nA year or so if I go to school it's going to cost me ... years of not working\nOn a tuition of around Ninety thousand dollars a side uh our gross income after I go\nClose to a three hundred thousand [noise] mhm [noise]\nSo uh but it's a what do you make a year now uh right now run Seventy thousand\nOkay so you're saying this is going to cost you a three hundred ... three years or three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow that nine out of pocket and can you live on her income or you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did ah when she was in school um but I don't think I can cash in anything right now because I I and I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house\nOr are putting it leads to putting a down payment for a house next year before I started school\nSo that then you need to wait until you can pay for school\nI Would I I never in Thirty years are doing the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school okay you've got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter of when you do it and what you put first what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with not agreeing\nYeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see in your budget how you can cash flow would um I can see it pretty easily ... to go through the class again or go to guy ... ... ... it's a three year program so thirty grand a year\nOr thirty grand a year yeah\nAnd and she makes what\nAh she makes a hundred and fifty thousand\nYou can't cash flow thirty granted I'm a hundred and fifty\nA long not when I'm On in coal no\nIf you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and unique thirty thousand a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I'm Sorry fifty thousand it it's a it's going to be around a a thousand a year\nI thought you said it was Ninety thousand\nI'm Sorry I got that wrong it's it's the sixty thousand a year\nSeems high\nYeah it it it is a it it is an expensive program\nYou know go to a less expensive program do that but cash flow is whenever you're going to pay for it figure out what it paid for\nBy usually go unless you have an old style stacked up ahead of time but you've got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has on student loans whether they finish or not\nAnd then you've got what's known as a freaking mess\nAnd so I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or something like that my life happens dude and the last thing you want the only time debt works is of everything works\nThe other than that that doesn't work\nAnd say wait till you to stay away from it thanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Joshua ... is in Dallas texas Hi Joshua how are you\nI'm good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nSo basically I Am in between whether I should fall for bankruptcy or just go ahead and start paying 'em all my at all um Nobel basically all my debts except my car or a collection so that's why the that's the only reason I'm basically contemplating um bankruptcy\nWhy are they only collections\nUm they're like own medical bills when is it is a car they got 'em brief oh the cause of a ... I Love my job and uh I think I think like a phone bill and then there too\nMhm okay so how much is the ...\nI'm actually only like a couple of brain I'm ... Ford I have on there is a ... than I Am by about four hundred and forty five dollars from an old apartment\nThree and a half years ago and how ... how much how much older and wiser medical data began\nI Would say about two thousand and one of the doubt if you're going to\nA record of it is it makes it very well like my ah phone bill and oh ... well you know so your your total that's less than twenty thousand dollars right and then I have um my car which is a twelfth out ... okay and what do you make a year\nI'm a little bit over forty five I make a thousand a week I'm a independent contractor\nMhm and you're single or married you're married or\nI'm twenty eight on Saturday\nAnd happy birthday does she work outside the home\nOr you know she uh pay their own daughter\nOkay well\nLet me tell you what I'm hearing okay and I think I'm hearing maybe I'm wrong I'm a\n... cat used to say that that is not the problem is the symptom\nOf something else was going on I'm right and it sounds like you guys are never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so every time an emergency comes up you get thrown out of an apartment so your car gets ... and you end up with a mess\nIf they're so we've got to get you on a plan where you are telling your money what to do or you're going to be back here if I waved to want to ... go way which is what bankruptcy might do maybe I'm if it did that and made you have a zero down all of a sudden except your car\nIf you don't change their habits that causes this mess in the first place you'll be back right where you are someday do you agree\nYes there you know so we really need to get under that says bankruptcy doesn't solve that are you going to solve that in the mirror you and your wife learning how to handle money I don't think you're bankrupt I think you're scared disorganized don't know what to do and have done nothing so far\nI think you can probably settle that old apartment that for three or four grand if you saved it up and offer them a lump sum settlement uh I\nI've actually called them multiple traveled to our garden ... do you do that one of the first video that I was looking up without a collect bears you know an laundries\nIt don't it doesn't change my answer to whether it's nine thousand or three thousand you're still not bankrupt\nIt still about you getting control of your money and\nWhen you do that then you're going to say your way through this bankruptcy is not a problem that you have your problem was got\nHelp you out I'm a singer families a total money\nThat

the question I Heather\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up and I just finished a baby step three and now I'm working on baby steps three the saving for a house got your emergency fund for ... yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long and baby step three bean before I she lives on to maybe step for was not a\nMagic cancer of the concept or the other critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this\nIf you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you screwed up your retirement right\nOr if you don't stay there long enough then you don't have a good solid down payment and you'll end up with other problems on the mortgage so it's a it's the pull between those two things\nAnd with most people that means you know three years four years something like that [noise] um but if you're if you're fifty nine it might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you in twenty eight on friday okay cool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty to\nWhat you had a really juicy down payment on a house and got a ... you know how to plan to pay it off in a few years because of that\nYou're not you're you're still going to retire multi millionaire you know if you do that at it but if you stayed out for Twenty years in called that baby steps we basically what I'm that's see that's kinda how you'd think through it from a critical thinking skills standpoint so how long were you thinking of\nWell I just started in June and I'm hoping to have it done in two years\nOkay and so Thirty years old you're your game own on retirement taken on a Fifteen year mortgage by forty five the mortgage is paid for if not sooner and uh you will have saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs gonna make you a millionaire multimillionaire usually I'm doing this so you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than day Ramsey says never go more than three years it's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other or because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go yeah it's all it is I thanks for stopping by think states\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five to to find Julian is in New York City how Julian how are you know\nI ... it can you hear me okay I can how can I help\nThank you very much for taking my call so I'm In a a bit of a unique position I'm I'm twenty four next year I'm going to medical school and uh I was I'm very very lucky and very appreciative uh I'm not going to have any debt to after graduating medical school but the the residency included I decide to specialize\nUm and uh what did you get a fellow guy or what I'm yeah I'm not certain that's what I Want to do yet I no no no I'm I'm asking how you did that oh oh um yeah so so\nAll of them very very very appreciative of how good\nNow yeah you should be that's amazing wonderful so\nUm yeah so when when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially control this funny 'cause it's under my name\nI'm but I'm Sorry I Apologize I'm Joe I'm\nA yeah I was I was given control this money and uh I've been given a very good financial advice from my father ah who's helping me manage it but\nUm because it's under my name and he he's actually in the rain thought me or I Would like a a second opinion as to what to do with this money and give it a little bit of money for a living expenses um and I've said that about five thousand dollars from\nSome small side jobs in hospitals but I Want to know how to capitalize on this and a half that myself up as best as I can for after medical school\nWell the the thing I Would be most concerned about is that the money is available and enough\nGet you through medical school\nUm it definitely is um about one third of it is invested very securely and two thirds of it I have in the evenings I'm In the two thirds we were discussing putting into at AT T bill on a three month renewal basis until I needed to take them out to pay my tuition and then I Would just reinvent the rest\nUm well I probably would not do that\nAnd the only reason is is that the bills basically or bonds\nAnd a bond interest rates are ... ah go into the bond values rather go down as interest rates go up and we are in an increasing and the interest rate environment so if you put a hundred thousand dollars in ... bills I could turn into Ninety pretty quick\nAs interest rates increase so that's not a very safe investment an environment that we're in right now um but if you wanted to have some portion of the money invested I probably would go to something like gross income type funds but I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and it doesn't have to really earn anything\nIf you want to keep it all very very safe that would be okay with me because the most important thing is for you to be able to graduate with zero debt\nAnd if you screw around with his money in some way and it loses value and you're not able to do that then the whole you know is like\nA ... we were concentrating on the wrong thing\nAnd Julian is the right thing to concentrate on Julia MMS debt free graduation is the most important part of this math equation not what this money is paying\nA it'd be nice to be a little bit sophisticated about it but if you get caught up in some kind of a sophisticated process and you end up losing money trying to trying to just get a little bit more on\nThis lump sum a you've defeated your own purpose short yourself in the foot so to speak so um\nThat's the process you're looking at I'm going to keep it pretty safe uh if you want to go toward something that's fine but I wouldn't use bonds for anything right now a fossil play Kimberly is in Pensacola Hi Kimberley how are you all\nDay and I'm doing great thanks so much for taking my call sure I I just want to thank you for all you do um

I defense reaching in the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represented the threat is\nThe only logical conclusion that we can come to is that we do not know if you ate pays represent a threat to the defense of the realm\nAnd so this this is quite interesting because\nAh parts of the the ministry of defense was saying to parliament the media and the public know there's there's no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if there was any difference in ... but no no no threat\nAnd yet in the way they were classified documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper\nAssessment and so we we can't tell\nWe simply can't sell well what about the alien abduction phenomenon I mean wouldn't that be proof for some kind of threat\nIt would be if we could absolutely say that it's it's basically rail and not not some sort of combination of\nHoaxes and psychological delusions send and other\nMisunderstood phenomena the the other thing is of course we don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these abduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like bought Hopkins type Jacobs\nWhere we're always saying you know the the style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack and and some of the other people who take him on new agents spiritual view of this talk about healing and things like that\nAnd he goes back to the idea of who who can really say I mean this sounds bizarre but in millet treat them there is actually in the nation for or I'm working out whether this is a threat to our knowledge over all of this this\nIs a kind of them we don't know the finally there's intelligence some military ...\nWe say that Frank has defined as being a construct of capability policy intend\nSo so you look at the capability you look at the intent and then you would count ways of the ... and if there is\nWhat ... what kind of a threat it is well we have some idea about the capability of pay and and again the the file the ministry of defense files they clearly you know pizza maneuvers\nWay in excess of anything that we've gone so the capability\nYou have any idea about is intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it won't we it may be unknowable in the u._k. the astronomer royal ...\nBack in like taking about extraterrestrial intelligence and and ... a gender and motivation said it may be trying to apply to try and figure this out he said it might be the analogy would be trying to explain quantum mechanics and\nWhen you find the well we don't know what it is we don't know what they want but can you categorically scenic that it's happening\nI Can't say that abduction is happening no I I don't know that but I mean visitations visitation at well\nWhat I can say is that there seems to be strong and credible evidence that you you pay a rail\nThat they do routinely penetrate are already defined region I'm In the u._k. the U.

other interesting thing about this is cool and these\nThese familial recollections is is the fact that\nYou know these these phenomena are always interpreted through the lens of of personal belief system and culture\nAnd it is interesting when you come up against couches where where this is the is it so much for calling place but it's it's like oh yeah you know ... that's the thing we don't

response\nI I have a second part a final question if I may okay\nNicky with us yeah sorry I thought you were going to hit me with pot too straight away while we're waiting for the ones that aren't one\nI'm now I'm going to sound a little bit skeptical on on this I Would say the on through is less than than a lot of things that I've I've read in in the UFO and pulled tentative belief communities I mean I've\nSeen some\nTalk about pilots going missing and and your fires and I think you know unfortunately flying is an inherently dangerous um occupational certainly laws in in the early days in

straight is part of the past month the excuse me I'm geographically challenged in that particular part of the world but um but yeah I I don't buy into the rumors that that I've had the pilots were were\nBeing and disappearing or all the time as a result of of this we had a case in the u._k. tragic case involving a pilot who who just crossed into the sea\nIn Nineteen Seventy it was during a night exercise and some people years later I tried to attribute to us for\nA story on to that but I pulled out the board of inquiry oil which was about two inches thick I went through every single paper in the file and I couldn't couldn't actually substantiate any of these rumors so I think I think the ... question is is very few\nNerves when do you okay go ahead and say\nOh okay so the second part question based upon your your response to this\nUh as you probably know during the Eisenhower administration there were so many aircraft\nThat we're a suddenly a malfunctioning falling out of the sky and uh yes in some cases just suddenly disappeared that the Eisenhower administration gave the order\nTo stop the pursuit the aggressive pursuit by American aircraft obese UFOs and secondly I spoke to Dr Heinrich before he passed away a Chicago radio station for about a five to seven minutes\nAnd I asked them what are the chances of a life or not existing on other planet and not coming and visiting us um and he said impossible that that was his response\nPerspective I Do personally believe\nThat they dominate the skies any time and every time that they come a within our airspace there's so many thousands and thousands and God only knows maybe millions of years they had the best they could be entered the mention all they could be cervical or both\nBut I don't think we're much match and they do have air superiority\nAnd [noise] I Do appreciate the honor and pleasure talking to both of you\nKnow actually the appreciation and well said by the way and\nAnd he made a really interesting point which goes back to something in the British in college so fast and check on the line and that was a I I don't like to go with him using but I I it was kind of\nPoignantly amusing maybe the ... that was on line about flight safety and safety implications off you a P which goes directly\nOf of course to the point if made and there was a recommendation in ... combines final report and it said I don't have it in front of me but but if I typically a pilot's encountering you ate pay extra take no action\nApart from trying to place the object done in other words you know whatever we dealing with hit don't mess with it\nDon't mess with that at all we're going to take a break pretty soon that can come back with funnel phone calls but I also want to talk with you you've done a thriller out called blood brothers don't you\nYeah I Do a kind of a different things for you\nYeah I um although I'm known for having run the UFO program I did a lot of other things in my Twenty one years at the MIT and my final posting within the direct her to defend security we did a lot of counter terrorism and things\nI've written fiction before I've written to psi phi novels about

waiting banners of human rights and\nYou don't want him to you know I take a stand against a various countries because there's human rights abuses but the countries in which there are no human rights at all like you don't watch them federation like China ah and certainly you know the Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia were beheadings and shopping\nAnd chopping off hands and fingers and you name it goes on on a daily basis so that could show the situation\nWhich is now sitting officially it about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still but a lot of loans to the don't get counted\nLet me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm going to walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if\nThe school provides a you know that they the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [laughter]\nUp but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of uh is that in nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the thing was that\nFor most apps and of the consumer protections that I just mentioned\nWhat if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nThey get that discounted off their student loan ...\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless\nYou're making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise] um [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there\nBut I can tell you that what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen\nA you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nOr people like Thomas Jefferson George Washington they were being pilloried by British brings merchants or so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war\nHas the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise] ah\nSo the founders you know are they require bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student loan\nThat's all they were going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition Allen\n[noise] oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to default on the loan default don't that's\nRight if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead well that's a defining hallmark of a predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the services and the gear and tours\nAre often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than alone the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where you know credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default [laughter]\nAh but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled to borrow or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they got a sixteen ... percent commission right off the wall\nSo you know where they can make the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for servicing a healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that under this but a federal student loans system are just completely perverted and it's been in turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nExplained the process of a default to loan in how the lenders make more money\nLoan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of and by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nHere does a that's a good case um could easy numbers to start with so fifty thousand or student loan when the student graduates what say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years\nUh they're unable to make payments they lose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise]\nUm the student can expect belong to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably defaulted somewhere around ... let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars well with penalties and fees and capitalize interests that are slapped onto that loan\nVery quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty twenty\nFive is hitting the ball or is responsible for that\nYes the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment and fall for\nRoughly ... let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars oh my\nGod so what the what the lending system will do will say oh you're in to vote on your loan\nBig trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment we can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed too you stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or\nSo ultimately they will wind up um hopefully in the government hopes of going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments\nFor about a four ten months typically none of those payments go towards alone this just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that oh this rehabilitation\nAnd at the end of the process they wind up signing for much newer much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars\nWell these agents and get his sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that are that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus ... it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nPeace in the making these agents or collection companies\nWhere are these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... higher education systems agency a and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well on these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own guaranteed horse so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would far rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than\nUh than alone the remains it's good said and I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there do not rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate they default again three to four times and they just\nKeep growing oh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loans\nPercent of the time [noise] it'll it process starts\nAgain to stay with us let's talk about if there's any recourse here and again we'll take calls next hour with Alan calling U.S Coast to coast down to sign up for coastal zone or free email newsletter today at ... dot com\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas Jefferson one said there are two ways the cocker and slave nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is or\nWhat happens more often than you would think George is\nThey will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the sons\nAnd they become subject to arrest show in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to ah to come\nTheir student loans I kid you not\nHumane if they're not properly served by a process server or the sheriff or private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nRuled that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly are and just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise] uh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had\nAn original I think was a three thousand dollar loan [noise] and they hold this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and\nUh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included and you know penalties interests in court costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nThat's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right do you know the uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison [noise] uh that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy rates ahead of the power to declare war has risen army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse\nSo let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans they all fifty thousand now they want to pay them the let's assume that's what they want to do but you're saying because of these defaults fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that it grows even more\nCan't they just cut a deal on the fifty\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a default alone if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it defaulted\nWhat kind of settlement is that\nFor most people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know if people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place\nUh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan default is pretty unrealistic for most people [noise] uh so you know the government has got you where do they want you on the student loans\nThey're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan just to start or just so many years ago\nYou know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nOr you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um [noise] I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was a sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to realize that you know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you saying that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there was about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to a recent revoked suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired ah from this public employment ... for the case of default student loans as cannon is happening as we speak\nHas this cross a park party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what is President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it [noise]\nThis goes way beyond Democrats and Republicans\nAre unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse under Obama I'm Obama essentially federalized the lending programs so that where before\nA bank such as was mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae cetera where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans and by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year\nWhich is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program\nNow Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before because the government property not student loans this is nonsense you know of all places that the government shouldn't be making a profit you would think student loans would be it\nA and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five you know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the lending system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days I'm so unfortunately you know Donald Trump's rhetoric was really good\nBut since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so who would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy devices\nWho herself had stock in struggling collection companies [noise] ah and you know frankly I don't think President Trump has really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds [noise]\nAh so I have I hold out some hope for him ah but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight to ... you could a file bankruptcy wipe out your student debt what happened\n[noise] well that's right so what happened was um\nSome of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they brought it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away\nAnd so um so yeah Congress in ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable what we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening\nFar less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans and bankruptcy less far less than the average for other loans [laughter]\nSo there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that we've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing and this was a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against us citizens\nWere with Alan calling his website a student loan justice dot org linked up the coast to coast am dot com his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of a nationwide tour these days tell me what you're doing\n[noise] oh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called HR twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply um delete the one line\nIt differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings so this really gets to the core of the problem and by by getting this bill passed a we would immediately see a dramatic decrease in the price of college\nAh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does administering the program [noise] ah so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nTelling a lot of people would prefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma or is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively to fix some of these student loan issues\nAbsolutely and I agree nobody wants to file for bankruptcy is a terrible thing to have to do and and even more difficult thing to fight for I should say [noise] ah but it's just the threat of bankruptcy that would really help the lending system but you know there there are a lot of things that we can and should be doing you know as I mentioned earlier President Johnson\nHow about a three time unit for only four thousand nine hundred Ninety six dollars cat they feed your actual said you money even called to explore sixty four sixty for it and like the girls

throw a maybe a trillion her show at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view you know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow\nI think on balance that would probably be a good thing it would return prices\nBack down to rational levels uh and you know it would it would um really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been alone allowed to creep into the system but ... but ... but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nAlong with all the debt right now Alan would you uh just wipe it clean\nWell I Will say that if I'm at a minimum bankruptcy protection is or not restored so that people can go to a judge and according to the wisdom of a judge 'em subtle that debt according to their means if that does not happen\nThen we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a non partisan guy but I Will say that\nThe Democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling\nKnow I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there are able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon is at a minimum the bankruptcy writes that the founders demanded aren't returned\nAll and you do have salaries and teacher salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[noise] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate\nIs that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly overcharging their students by and large\nThey could probably suffer eighth thirty percent if not forty percent reduction\nIn the student loan income that they're currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person a and you know be able to service all the students that they do today so I think there was a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia um\n[noise] so yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise]\nUm but certainly there's got to be a middle ground you know and with bankruptcy back with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other Linder has to contend with [noise] ah that would go a long ways towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools\nTo lower their prices improve their quality\nAnd decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFirst time caller mark in Provo, Utah Marco head\nWell George you said they can't or they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school I was on a full scholarship even pay for my books but the federal government makes you go to the student loan counseling so I went\nAnd I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me Will Hunting if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it\nOh boy I Would love to sue her this\nDid you end up doing that oh yeah and then life happens the money disappears yeah you know over fifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student loans and loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars yes like Ellen ... pay it off I Will die owing money\nDo they harass you mark [noise]\nNo I'm right now they've got me on some ridiculous thing where uh my payment is zero [noise]\nUm I did a double major in a minor and some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I would've never tasted that crack had she not pedaled it took me exactly exactly well what do you think Ellen these loans are\nPushed on the students way ahead of any scholarship or any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay back I mean the college and some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nA private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's it's just disgusting [laughter]\nYou know I might actually add um the repayment program that the to mark is on a is probably the income based repayment program a bunch of government programs out there that sound like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness there's income based repayment but what all everybody out there needs to know\nIs that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where\nYou work for a you know if you work in a college or hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it\nLeft wing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan so so that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I be our program\nAnd actually get the loan for given a and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so twenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals very ... probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nAlthough the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a that\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for ... and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit I'm inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're gonna come back and take final culture with you in just a moment here on coast to coast am [noise]\n... the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for I'm

E. R. dot com [noise]\n\nAnd welcome back this is our final segment with Alan calling us as we talk about these student loans scam Ellen are the student loans that are out there now hurting or helping the economy\n[noise] [noise] well I think it's clear that it's hurting the economy at this point\nUh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars more than Ninety billion dollars a year\nOr so that money that gets taken away from home purchases a you know business formation or auto ... you know other ... big ticket items that improve the economy [noise]\nUh so certainly is hurting in that respect a and you know it's it's also hurting and a number of ways are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people a straddle or as you know strapped under oh this these sort of debt levels\nParticularly the sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um this really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't otherwise do [noise]\nI'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy\nA and certainly those people pay no taxes and then et cetera so so it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not\nA parent or to the naked eye\nLet's go to Paul Fresno, California to get things started here west of the Rockies Paul Go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you pick Michael thank you very much George Allen had graduated from college to dealt with it and just before it closed down [noise]\nI'm I'm One of those who are at one point three to aloe with talking about that actually got um most because they were given I got\nThirty ... thirty seven thousand but I got you know that I owed forgiven wow how'd you do that graduation shall I appreciate that thank you well I I did a little bit of an hour away um\n[noise] there's something called a binding and what that is is that like a lifting of pretty much like uh\nAnd what to do is uh if they are of course who are the reason they're in the situation because they both by job place so if you were from\nA certain time period to a time period at the end of the school I'm pretty much that's when they committed a that broad who it actually took me from I Would have to say December to ... it seemed to around August of two thousand and fixing to get it all given\nWhat I did is I actually will Kamala Harris and email I'm surprised that we bonded\nUm but uh the avenue that I went to go after giving advice to cover letter hum I submitted a pretty much a with a cover letter I had to put a bloody on it then I had to pretty much do\nI put it all out but what I had gone through a at the summit transcript had to uh a cover letter transcripts and pretty much all the information that I actually had to prove that I went to college\nYeah it was the fraud that that got it reduced I guess right\nA yes or that one of the main things I put there because if you see many of the old college commercials whipping they promises life long job placement of cooking [noise] so what how I false advertising\nYou exactly who went to school shut down there goes your job place there goes your life long drop but at the\nRight you got that right or interesting Alan isn't it\nYeah that you know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up at some other point and show there is some breaking news now where if you went to particularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught lying just like the just like Paul mentioned\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings for your degrees this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where\nIf your school ... you then at least on paper you have available to you and avenue called defense to repayment where you\nAt least theoretically can get your loans cancelled and I\nI think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen this works successfully for him [laughter] ah but I Will say that even just yesterday and um [noise] one of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of delay and slow walk this ... this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who are light to buy their colleges are then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be\nBecause believe me at the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely have to uh you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise] um but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so you were lied to by\nParticularly for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for record snow\nAll you know with all this or credit card fraud that's out there and just credit fraud indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency for some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the ... and they don't provide it to you they're up a creek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right and not similarly for student loans we find a lot of a private loans the underlying note uh well first of all the loan has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned a note actually does not owned the note and they have no business clicking on that loan I'm\n... now there are other there are some avenues that the the lenders can go to they can say that the note was lost and they have other avenues to prove that it is a valid note but that certainly is something to be aware of\nFederal student loans they do have statute of limitations so somebody comes up to you Twenty years hands and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than\nAlmost certainly that loan is a little ... little there you suspect um and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern the sticker alone depending on where you live or where he took up alone\nWho go to pat and Minneapolis east of the Rockies Hi Pat go ahead\nI worked in Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at at least one of the agenda is is the destruction of the Social Security program because\nThere are families with co signers of grandparents parents and students none of them are ever going to get any Social Security forum I have a question and I think Justin alright if if I own a house\nAnd I can find on one of these student loans is does that lean on my house so that when I die instead of in my ear is getting at\nIt's collected for a for a student loans\nThat goes through the loan first doesn't it\nWell that's a that's a great question to her first point\nYes Social Security wages are being garnished as we speak for student loans and what is even more disturbing icy legislation out there right now and has been passed yet but I see legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in uh in return for people for going\nTheir Social Security when they when they reach retirement age uh so there are some people at work in Washington DC very busy trying to figure out how to take away Social Security benefits down the road from student loan borrowers\nInteresting and ... what did you have the same as your family\nHas already where we don't take generations the grandparents and parents and the kids they're never going to get any thoughts scary but it just you know is that if you have if you want to help the students\nAnd tear ability you write a check to the school or a money order aura travelers jak or whatever and when the kid brings yet you know says well here's my transcript from last semester you want to help me this semester\nAnd when you hand over or whatever you're going to help them with don't forget this part of them a pat on the back and say the whole family is proud of you for being such a great student and such a hard worker\nWell that's part of being a good parent that you've got to do that with a child and\nAre you from then on a national job back to jump can be a balancing act and you'll have to

or\nAs he shows some time to time so that leaves me here alone then they'll go that's okay I get through I guess there's a\nGeorge Soros as entered Alabama politics and a big way over the uh over the weekend and uh filings yesterday that first weekly filings yesterday\nShowed that George Soros is dumped two hundred thousand dollars directly now this isn't do some\nYou know a lot of times if it was George Soros is good and involved in that race what they mean is some George Soros linked group or some group George Soros gave money to in the past or some something you know that that George stores may have once been identified with this group and they've done to this is actually George Soros like if\nYou look at\nThe filing which I've done\nIt was I think five or six filings in a bunch of different packs cash back see I'm GT leadership pride back to teach them back to if you\nGo look at these packs and you go look at the\nContributor and it's not hard to do in the sector states website if you know what you're doing but it's not trust me I've done it a very by this information is accurate\nIf you go look at these packs the money\nCame from George Soros not the Soros Foundation not some Soros business not some shady group is Charles once donated to Twenty years ago they came from George Soros in his personal offices headquarters is listed\nAs the address\nThis is George Soros entering Alabama politics you might say to yourself or ... why would George Soros want to enter Alabama politics\nI don't know\nI ... the reality is I don't know I'm assuming\nIt's back and want medics\nBecause this pack these these series of packs have contributed about thirty percent or more of Walt Maddox is\nMoney\nSo if you're voting for Walt Maddox you're voting for George Soros control over Alabama I Do believe that until I have a reason to believe otherwise I'm going to believe that uh these packs have not been active in a lot of other races they're active in the ...\nAnd like I said they've they've contributed about a third of his money so if a third of my money comes from\nThis guy named Steve and Steve gets two hundred ...\nYou can probably guess I'm going to be the intended beneficiary\nNow I'll say this now that they the contributions were from two fifty west fifty fifth street that's in the name of George Soros again not like some company his personal name like these were personal checks from George Soros two hundred thousand dollars worth of them from George Soros now\nYou might say to yourself well that doesn't really matter\nThat doesn't really matter ah\n\nMaybe George Soros is all of a sudden the nice guy maybe he's gotten over his never Trump or never Trump or global as pro immigration ways I don't know maybe yes my guess is he hasn't I guess as he has a this is the guy who worked for the Nazis turning against\nHis own people [laughter] Hungarian ghetto or\nYou know this this this is a bad actor is a bad actor or but George Soros now active in Alabama politics it's possible he gave even more money to Walt Maddox packs I guess we'll call them woman expected given them all that money\nOr\nI Can't think of anything else he be given money to an Alabama I mean can you what else does George Soros care about is the only really competitive race on the ticket\n\nBut if you're voting for well managed to understand George Soros is his big boy it I mean as far as I see this speaking of Walt Maddox you almost feel bad for the guy\nHe seems like a nice enough cap\nA but then I read this headline on AOL dot com Walt Maddox has already lost isn't ... mayor\nWalt Maddox has already lost or what Meyer says where I grew up there's a saying they have for folks who looked like Walt Maddox in his first and latest campaign ad that guy doesn't look out of his eyes just right\nAnd let me tell you I went back and watch that ad again after reading this base\nHe doesn't look at it as I was just right he's a nice guy don't get me wrong I interviewed him on their uh met him a couple of times in the past he's a nice guy I think he's probably a confident enough mayor a though crime is skyrocketing interest group cook Tuscaloosa by the way\nI'm not sure why I don't know if that's a well Maddox problem or of crime problem just to crime from outside of his control but the crime is skyrocketing interest goes but anyway um I felt bad for them\nBecause who whoever is handling this guy had an opportunity I think to take a shot at Kay Ivey and really go swinging at her I'm almost wondering was Walt Maddox set up\nIs he throwing in the towel is he is he is he to the point now where he knows he can't win so he's not even trying to win\nBecause look you could take some swipes at Kay Ivey I I've done it here I I didn't think it would the feeder but we're just trying to cover the news fairly and honestly trying to be philosophically consistent intellectually honest factually correct as we are\n\nBut I mean there's things you can take swipes at or on the ... program what basically bankrupt on her watch now the economy turned down and things went horrible I get that but she was in charge she was the head treasure in charge when it happened\nUm\nShe didn't stop it from happening so I mean you could you could make that claim you could say hey ah that doesn't\nThat doesn't ring true madam governor or there's some other things you could go after on as pointed out in this column and I could I could actually point out more than ...\nHer first campaign ad was that she'd cleaned up the corruption in Alabama and since then like five Republicans have been arrested on federal charges\nIt Henry and Mickey Hammon and others you know it doesn't seem to squeaky clean\nDoesn't seem to squeaky clean I think the striking juries on some of these cases right now but there are other things you get hit or she almost cost Donald Trump and the United states of America\nShe almost cost us a Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nShe did give us a democratic senator I mean you can enter on these things obviously well medics probably would want to hear that but\nThere's a number of things you could go after on the question is why is he sitting back in his campaign ad says Hi I'm forty five\nOkay what does that mean forty five years old and then he says he's pro life he's pro Second Amendment and he'll never lie to you he says I'll make you to promises are never put my party ahead of the people then I Will never lie to you\nI'm not sure that's a winning in I'm not sure that's an ad that lives in a little\nUh I think it's a lousy ed and I think well medics noses ... lousy and I think well managing people notes a lousy it\nListen we've been hearing for weeks that there's this big bombshell coming against Kay Ivey this big massive game changing bombshell there's going to change the nature of the race and Kay Ivey is going to lose and Walt Maddox was going to ... get on the wall managed trained because he's got the big bombs with a big October surprise\nThe big October surprise turned out to be that her doctors said she didn't have a stroke that's a surprise that see I told her doctor releases a letter that says a review the records I didn't see a stroke no no I'm Sorry the October surprise was\nWashed up former Elise secretary Spencer Collier\nWho was fired for cause by the way I'm\nWashed up former ... secretary Spencer Collier\nIs all of a sudden now in the stroke diagnosing business he's no longer a of a trusted lieutenant at a state trooper\nIs no longer the head of a leader he's now a doctor I guess he Dr Spencer calling well Dr ... claiming he confirmed this was the headline and one of these ... Dr Spencer call your confirms the governor had a stroke like symptoms are so many stroke or something well Dr spent Chicago is no doctor at all he's a police chief in Selma\nLast I checked 'cause I was having a stroke like symptoms\nOn among the list of people in this river region I Would go see such a call you would be very far down the list\nI think every person with an empty or a deal behind her name would be on the list how I might even go to my chiropractors before I went to spend to call you\nMight go to some drug sharman I might go to the local drug dealer how he's probably seen people overdosed the kind of look like they're having a stroke so you might know what to tell me to do I might\nI gosh I don't know maybe just start picking random people on the yellow pages then I might get to a police chief how's he not that strong symptoms that was he on the record confinement anything quarter ridiculous story was that the October surprise was supposed to take down ...\nThat some police chief in ... said she was having a stroke symptoms that's that's the October surprise that's the big thing we've been waiting on\n\nI'm telling you this ... this this campaign is over what Mannix has already lost and now George Soros is dumping in almost a quarter of a million dollars [noise] I don't think it can get worse if you're a what management and I know there are people who just for whatever reason don't like Kay Ivey I don't get it I don't get it [noise] of parents she's old [noise] get over it [noise]\nIt in my hand wandering around any of that kind of stuff or in Alabama you can be ticketed protection and driving but not for using your hand held device\nIn Georgia you can if you pick up your phone they can pull you over and take it you some other states that way but I don't have that way um and they're looking to change that in Alabama to make it so have you grab your phone you can be ticketed\n\nAnd they're working with legislatures legislators are trying to do this is going to be ... and January it'll be up for vote in March the story says but then again how the world where people just because you've ... something in January doesn't mean it's gonna be up for vote in March [noise] I'm\nIn a camp ward says they're strong support for the bill in both the house and Senate okay great wonderful hundred percent yeah I'm a I'm Glad that they support for this but as it\nIs there something that can stop you from putting on makeup in the car because I'm Sorry that that to me seems like a bigger distraction at least among talking on the phone I'm looking down the road\nBut I see a lot of these people there is there something to stop you from whipping your child's asked in the back seat because I see people driving down the road all the time turnaround whipping a child that's in the back seat is that just is that distracted enough to warrant a law no no no weapon child asks while you're driving down the road how do you\nWhat kind of cool uh\nBill title could you come up with with that\nOr is there something to stop you from eating that double fillet of fish from McDonalds I see you guys over there to actually get sandwich there's nothing to stop you from that it's friday you're being a good Catholic you go through the fillet official on which you're hungry as you go to a double layer fish\nYou know and make sure you do an extra piece of cheese on there now\nGrossed out under the lights the last thirty minutes there is there any other is there any law about the ... what I'm getting at here is this seems to me like oh ... no cattle\nAnd this law right here seems to be people that want to run around and pat themselves on the back and act like they've help children but I had a damn thing they do the same people almost tried to kill a DUI bill last year that's going to save lives in Alabama\nAll because some useful courts where you'll make as much money\nThese are the same people who don't even bother putting out a budget on time most of the time not one that anybody can read I'm supposed to work I'm supposed to believe they're worried about distracted driving\n\nHe's the same people that we still don't have a casino in this [laughter] I mean a a lottery in this day there's a lot there's a lot going on that they can address or before we get to bear and call them and make cell phone calls while you're driving down the road I think there's also unfairly targets poor people\nAnd I think ah people ought to consider that\n\nThis is I think the law also on targets as unfairly targets poor people who is more likely to have a hands free device like Bluetooth in their car\nThat middle class upper middle class or the guy barely getting by the poor people well when you're potentially saying is rich people get to make phone calls on the road and poor people do good for people would have to hold their phone they can't they can't hit a button on the steering wheel and say\nA ...

I mean I I don't understand\nWhy do you think\nSpeculate my worst fears but I'm either he doesn't know what he's doing\nOr he has absolutely ... notion [noise]\nWhat allows America to leave the world\n[laughter] it's kinda interesting and I have them in this order certain kind of get to progression here but Joe Biden candidate conveniently forgot about it oh the ... that happened in the Obama administration particularly Syria\nAnd the chemical weapons being used in wait in line but what happened in Afghanistan and when they pulled out and then what happened when they pulled back out of Iraq and then they had to go back and do the search you get it back\nI mean the short term memory folks are kind of out there but the interesting part when I look at the center for twenty twenty and we've got ... Harris and all of these folks that are jockeying Cory Booker Elizabeth Warren [noise]\nBut I think with the talk of the day when the Democrats cannot be this measure thoughtful type thing\nI think it's going to be fiery rhetoric for somebody to place in the folks that Joe Biden is leading the polls right now and maybe that measure will be out there but they let you sit there and kind of just do that and not\nBe attacked by that particular they're behind protected attendance third fourth place as some of these states and the order of these events are going to be really important concerning from Iowa New Hampshire and South Carolina too a very different places that you need to cater to in a different way\nAnd it's interesting the that Trump\nDid well one and two of them and they did well in one of those Iowa and I think the\nIowa was kind of the Ben Carson factor for Iowa and how that played out\nBut I'm not sure that measured a Joe Biden is going to work in the Democratic circles particularly when you get to places like South Carolina where Cory Booker and committed Harris should do really well\nBecause there because of the percentage of black cetera boating in the Democratic primary New Hampshire not so much I was a little bit different story it there but all three distinct different states that you have to really play too\nOkay now he's going to be talking about coddling autocrats in dictators are too\nDoubts about the leadership of the crown prince Mohammed ... who did they do and I have a high ... confirmed\nWent out to you have with us are\nAbout the same yeah I think is interesting I think it has something to some detail of it is to strive for\nOrdered the killing of ... to write a column for the Washington Post should there be consequences absolutely positively this was a prominent American\nWe this administration seems to feel the need the coddle a auto yeah\nSpeculate of my worst fears but time either\nSorry about that mislabeled mislabeled mislabeled once you've where the line when we play or suppressing the boat here this one this one will get you\nIt's a loaded up a bus to vote early they were told to get\nDo you believe that voters depressions anyway\nAbsolutely look uh\nI have the exact numbers but somewhere in the order of Seventy seven in the last couple of years piece of legislation to do some state legislatures to restrict the right to vote to reduce the up we should we should have automatic registration is\nWe haven't allowed me to everybody to vote\nAnd you know all these everybody's I don't know\nI Can't like felons you can't let it you know people who are in this country legally they have to have an id say well no they don't have to have an idea where they have to demonstrate that they live there and who they are they don't have to have a particular id\nThey don't have to have a government issued id they don't have to have that's not true\nAnd the truth of the matter is that all the talk about voter fraud did the president\nFind any of it yes and this big hole thing the reason he won the popular vote come on\nWhat was the only one out when top yeah but ... but my generic point is there is no no evidence and all the studies time\nOf widespread voter fraud that the in the central problem in American electoral process\nAnd it shows you can't get into kind of a point you to look at it there Joe let me go to the phones and go to Tom tom more than more than a more show on a Thursday\nI Hope you guys doing okay I'm up there like that you guys like by some might be doing could help me out

'cause when you talk to scientists off Iraq they were allowed to sell all and that's what they were doing there so I don't think it was a hundred million I think it was ten million dollars a day for three hundred million a month\nOut that I might it might have got him a next that fat rang out and do they use the al ... says we got our aren't supply the way they do say over\nHere they still they

going by really is a Mark Meadows is pretty chapter\nAnd roses and saying that the New York times just lie about that and I guess the question would be is Jim Baker line McCabe line and they

the guy that was caught\nAnd how close he came to taking Hitler out but of course\nWhen did you hear a today or never let a crisis go to waste that was Hitler's motto mhm and they use the crisis the close call with his assassination to kill more people to intimidate further yes he ... he believed that one\nSorry are suffering for Nineteen we've been having some fun this afternoon uh in fact now that the weather's starting to get cooler in the upper levels of the atmosphere a chilling we're seeing now we've seen some things in the sky and I thought I was going to take Terry temperature\nBecause there was a trail grid in the western sky and he says look at the numbers now and it's one thing if you see one thing in the sky that remind you or looks like something\nBut this was a stack of trails in the western sky and at one point in the stack on the southern end of the stack of trails yeah I'm not making this up\nYou could see very clearly a three five and eight seven and a one honest to God it looked like it was stamped into the blue\nNow one thing you can say oh that's just you know coincidence that was just plain freaky that was for it so there was no need to take your temperature because I saw two metric stupid me I meant to mentioned when we came back up\nAnd then the other thing that we love to do when the weather cools off and we get the bay for trails for correctional flights Terry told me about this app for your phone call flight radar twenty four so only a few bucks at the store and basically what it does it just displays your location do what I like to do the game for us as\nAs we were sitting outside checking traveling couple of minutes ago traffic is fine so we looked in the heavens\nNot next to each other woman was behind the other\nAnd I like to guess where they're going you're good at it to ... you know facing or they said that looks like Chicago to Miami and maybe one\nWell I was wrong on the origin nation both flights that taken off from Memphis woman's going in Miami woman is going to Tampa 'cause you gotta figure if it's gone one of them went directly over us and\nYou gotta figure if they're out they're creating a trail which has to be well I'm of thirty thousand feet they're not going to Atlanta certainly arrived to be much lower to land there unless you wanted to freak the passengers\nOn [laughter] um well you're wrong about the study of origin but you're correct to both flights came from the same city yeah and\nIt was Memphis they were fed ex flights mhm that's interesting that they are both to the same time heading for basically Florida but and bringing this up not doing pressure with my geography guessing skills as just a fun thing to do because if you position yourself\nAnd make sure you're facing do northwest Easter whatever north always makes the most sense if you look over head I think my greatest\nWe saw a thick trail ... months ago back in the spring and I could tell that the plane that was creating it was huge because that's all four engines that's from the ground\nSo I knew it was like seven eighty seven or one of those new jumbo jets\nAnd I said that looks like it's going to Mexico or something for ice and sure enough Mexico City Mexico City was the destination that flight so you just you see a little plane icon that matches where you are and where the the trailers and it'll tell you a little display the information about what's weird [noise]\nThere was a flight there was a plane leaving a trail going north bound ... miners all kinds of trails up there today\nYup that are just hanging you're not evaporating and just hanging and they don't do that compensation doesn't do that it shouldn't go ... and I kept the the aircraft I kind of on the screen for that no information available military\nYeah but what about law the commercial flights have to put their their trans ponder has to be picked up right by law that happened a couple\nOf years ago so if it was civilian they would be something there I just thought it was it is interesting mighty interesting where you really good at this this usually you get the the originating city and the destination you're pretty good at that\nOh I thought we had to call in traffic report no complaint no [laughter] anything you know\nA ... and colors and you know she needs to go because your bombers ... when the county you're in

evening ... from six to nine\nShow the head\nYou talking about rocket the success of yes those kinds of numbers in the ratings and a chair six to nine Saturday night's news talk to any three point one of them once on the agenda for this weekend\nUm there's been a lot of stuff out on the ... the alternative media about the insects dying off and I've been talking about this for gosh two years 'cause I've been doing my own research with my microscope and finding\nA it's a long story but the but finding insects that are all infested with it looks like now particulates and also fibers coming out of them so I'm finding a lot of data insects in Germany in the state parks or for years they've been monitoring their insects eighty seven percent decline in Germany and insects in the last year so\nWhat would I Am not doubting that but what what would be causing that and why would somebody want to perhaps make that happen deliberately [noise] ah it's well because they serve a purpose\nYeah Oh absolutely it's the food chain ... you know what each the insects the birds what each the birds you work your way up and guess who's at the top we are\nSo if you're going to put mankind in a bad situation that's the way to do it that's one way to do it\nUh I Believe that the particulates that they're spraying and I believe there is a ... program or an aerosol program and I believe that particular case that are coming down a lot of them are now particulates I Believe they're invested in the insects that you know now that was a billionth of a meter\nWhich has nothing to you and ... to an insect that's a lot bigger than it is to us because there's so much smaller than we are\nI think they're being invested with an anal particulates the the fibers and I think it's killing ... it's killing them off it in this might be an unintended consequence because we know the aerosol program has like five different purposes one of them is a missile shield\nBasically when you fail the sky with now particularly in states if Russia where to fire an ICBM they fire off in what's called an atmosphere heater which turns those particulates in the plasma a missile hits it it blows up they can't get through it a missile shield there's several different reasons for the country also I think one of the consequences intended or not just killing off the insect\nYou know ... not going to be any nuclear ... what was it put him said just today are all Russians will go to heaven if there's a nuclear event at least they have places to go with there's a nuclear event we don't\nNot anymore you know a movie I watched\nAnd they they they do a lot of the arising I'm assuming based on\nSome known facts sure about ways that uh missiles could evade it may have had something to do with our satellite orbits and patterns and so forth they can escape detection\nI wouldn't doubt that but on the other hand that theory maybe they do this just in case you know\nProbably has raunchy by formal

F understands this\nYou talk a good game on a values and you stand up for values but at the end of the day the world is a messy place the truth is rarely pure and never simple in the middle east for thousands of years\nUnder different banners and different names has been ruled by violent thugs\n\nSo we can point fingers at the Saudi Government and tell the Trump Administration to bring our troops home bring our money home stopped giving them weapons and you know what I'm all for\nIt but remember that this man who was brutally murdered and dismembered was calling for freedom of the press and the Arab world so the air people could really know what was going on so they could have open a conversation\nAbout their own societies but the role of their religion in their societies but the role of women in their society the role of men role of actual commerce with the outside world\n\nHe was calling for freedom of press could show was before he was brutally murdered and where it was brutally murdered yes technically on Saudi soil but in the consulate in Turkey and recently I started off by saying there's this trend of strongmen\nBased on cold for personality and that is president aired on of turkey\nYou could not get any worse country in the Arab world for freedom of the press there is no free press left in Turkey none\nAired on has saw fit to do what ever since the ... coup against him he has sees and brought in consolidated more and more power around in jest is Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince of Saudi Arabia has consolidated more and more power to himself\nSo essentially you have one autocrat calling out another autocrats for is bloody autocratic behavior\n\nSo okay they call them out we still have military assets in both countries\nThey're crucial countries in terms of the geopolitical game\n\nAnd almost every country we support in that part of the world including Egypt is backed by some autocratic strong armed authority\n\nBut there's hope and you hope that those autocrats\nWere overthrown you'd get a more peaceful regime because if something can go on forever it will stop\nBut these things\nAnd I think the best thing we can do in the west whether we're talking about the middle east\nOr we're talking about the severely now regrets thing China as president she\nNo well again it's the theme consolidating more and more power to himself now president for life of China\nSuggestions that he is now almost like a new Mao kind of the ... and the Chinese of the century of humiliation\n\nBeginning in the mid nineteenth century\nOf the west in the imperial powers of the west humiliated trend never again China's rising China's nationalist than president she will be the one that helps\n\nSteer the ship they rising new powerful global leader in China\n\nSame thing's happening in Russia ... is the main thing keeping that country together the cold the personality around ...\nIt's the classic Russian model autocracy orthodoxy and good God I never thought I'd say this but I Wish the Russians were materialist atheist again is Russia ... today cell Russians and go to heaven and we have a nuclear war good God man no they won't don't die\nBut autocracy orthodoxy order and the autocrat is\n\nThe best strategy we have for those of us in the west with some semblance of freedoms and it's tough for me to talk about because we don't feel that free these days to weeks folks we have freedoms no doubt\nBut the way we use them\nWe use your freedoms almost like we're holding somebody hostage\n\nWe presume Americans ... freer innocent\n\nIt's no longer life liberty and pursuit of happiness but sacrificing our own freedoms and those of our fellow Americans for the sake of control\nFor just a few more bucks a month\nAnd if something can now go on forever it will stop and in that case what will stop is the economic boom when we have another economic downturn because we will\nGod help us\n\nI think the best thing we can do is to be an example\n\nTo try and not as we were run on party lines tickets 'cause that's the big fight we argue over Democrats or Republicans and neither one side's gonna win out completely or just going to go back and forth and never solve any damn problem\n\nBut there's a lot we can solve\nI don't do shows like this often 'cause it gets me worked\nUp and I want to have fun\nFor instance this morning I
