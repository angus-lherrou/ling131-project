wall up uh-huh and I like the week before they put the wall all actually two days before the put the wall up yeah one guy comes over into\nTo East Germany yeah and he takes his car posted in shop ... and the gases ... where's it going to be ready said Tuesday [laughter] is is okay when he goes back over the other side over there to West Germany I Hope I got this right\nA late library books it's David Stern is\nThank you risk man you just keep on making me feel is a man\nI'm here for so today we're talking about the the things that ah can make you feel warm and fuzzy a new new laws in the how Trump is coming out with some new stuff\nMhm and uh I understand he's coming out with a lot of stuff is going to help people who are trying to put away money for their retirement\nThat's right now a lot of people say well you know my retirement is going to get locked up I've got a a a of a retirement program that little I did a little chastising a little earlier before the break a\nMedical workers are being done wrong in this city because they should be able to take money I Wonder if it demand and a half or even though they're still employed\nIf anyone is listening to this is a management person you can change that all you gotta do sailing investment company to change that or get that you know what out ... and lives will be another when they do it for you and I want to say right now I Know for a fact\nThat uh and you do too I'm sure in in the medical field right you know nurses\nWork hard they sure do now when they went on that TV show what was that the view\nOr just want to put my foot through the television talking about nurses didn't work hard and they or you know just a bunch of prima donnas now I Know that these are not been in the hospital yes and I know you know nurse comes in their spends ten minutes for me I'm not one not only one on that floor and she's got to look after\nAnd you know\n...\nThese people deserve the respect of course their male nurses to right they're out there and there were there taking care of folks and then not getting the appreciation and they they don't need this this problem that you just mentioned\nWell it's not just nurses you got the laboratory people ... who who should have a lot more respect in you know they're they're kind of like the unknowns you got the X ray and the radiological paypal\nOr you've got to physical therapy people you've got all these you got all these different aspects you you've got the transportation maple you got the pharmacy\nYou know everybody works as a as a you know as a unit that showed a hospice\nOiled machine right\nAh but the fact is when you when when a when a hospital\nPuts together a retirement plan and they get snow covered and I'm going to use the word snuck it by the investment or people\nInto a allowing the contract to be sign that they can't take the money out when they're fifty nine and a half and even though they're stealing board ... is something wrong with that because a lot of people break down and they want to start working part time or they want to work\nOr somewhere else and keep that job a little bit you know but the fact that they if they're working just one day a month\nInvestment company says you can't have your money and you're like sixty five sixty six seven years oh almost if you can't get any money\nThen you have to quit your job so you can get your mind that something wrong with that picture of you know a lot of people when they get to that and a half they deserve they said well we're just doing it so that they cause they spend their money I get that picture but what if you're fifty nine and a half and you've got quite a bit of money in there and you want to take some of it out and put it\nMode that you could go into and then you're kind of stuck in a mode that you don't want to be and they need to put some more liquidity in these things so these four O. one K. is are getting that way ... the I'm I'm Talking ... more bad about for three days and four fifty seven\nUh those those plans haven't gotten to where the four oh one case have got brought one K. is they're still not where they need to be ... but the full ... have more protection mechanism a lot of them will allow you to take out a what they call a just to withdraw\nAnd usually they put in there like fifty nine and a half is usually the the primary age but they can put in their forty five or they could put thirty five mhm it's all in the plan documents okay\nIn the in the more liberal it is I see people all the time and trying to borrow their own money out of a for all three bay paying interest they're restricted they don't get their money okay some people would not save I get it I get the ... but when you're fifty nine and a half and you can get your money I think he went too far with it way too far\nSo how can you tap\nYour retirement savings without getting hit with a penalty by the government that's another story but we're going to talk about\nA centrally or that's called a Seventy two tea you say what is a Seventy to take as many as ... Seventy to the distribution of you know\nLet's say you did have a four O. one K. they would allow you to take some money out before you were fifty nine and a half okay and if you worry then you're you're dealing with a good company okay maybe you can be forty five\nSo you say look I'm going to continue to work\nBut I Need to get a hold of some of that money because I've got children to send the college I got this got that and ah maybe they set up a program for the for the the nice thing with Trump maybe they didn't and we're going to get more into that\nSo the Seventy two tea will let you take a distribution of payments over a certain period of time I think it's five years do hope that\nAt a certain amount you can't turn it off you can but if you do then all of them the money gets the penalty okay so if you had a hundred thousand dollars maybe you could take out five thousand dollars or ten thousand whatever the number would be\nPer year with out a penalty you do have to pay taxes if his before when Ralf no you would not pay taxes on that\nA and a lot of people say well how would that help for one wrong you don't have the votes taxes anyway keep in mind you've got to be fifty nine and a half to take money out of a rough regularly without any taxes a lot of people don't know that there's two guidelines on or off our eyes and for one case and that it's one you\nYou need to be in there at least five years you got to satisfy that right hand fifty nine and a half which ever\n... in other words if you were sixty two and you just did it\nYou just are then you'd have to use that staying in five years if you just put it in rye rye if he were if you were fifty five and you put it in a row and then you turn fifty fifty nine and a half or a really sixty at that time you'd be sixty then you could take money out without any tax or he just got another little loopholes about it\nAnd that's where someone like me comes that's David Ernest right there to seven nine seven\nFour three one he knows the little ins and outs of the loop holes was what what are the say the the the the Eddie and the flow of the old thing he knows all about it and doing it for Thirty years\nCalled him up to seven nine seven four three one and talk to them about your finances to say\nYou want to make more hay and\nHe's a lot of people don't realize that your four one\nK. using near our raves and you're\nFor all three babies even if they were to allow you to take the money out which for freebie usually won't ah there is a ten\nPercent penalty on top of taxes\nAre in it less you're fit to that in half a lot of people say well how does that equate well I'll give you an example let's just say that you have had this happen people come to me is I have ... I'm In trouble but I Need my retirement money and I said well look I'm\nYou're going to get hit hard how's that going to happen held already well I'm fifty five okay\nCan you wait until you're fifty nine and a half no can't do it I got to pay this house off while you got to pay the house off where am I just have to de ... says they brand who say that I had to [laughter] well now sometimes people get into a pickle I had somebody they had was trying to do from one house to the other and\nAh they couldn't get a loan unless they got the when paid off who so they could have been some creativity done there where they could have took some money out of an hour I pay the house of\nBeen sold it during that ah sixty day period hopefully if they didn't ... then they're gonna get crushed but the you got sixty days to do a roll over that still law as long as you do one hour a a year if you do more than one hour a the government always listens to these companies\nThere's a few companies and I'm not going to name him 'cause I I really dislike them but I don't want to get sued so\nI'm not going to name [laughter] but they went to the IRS and\nSaid hey why don't you stop them don't let them take more than one hour a a year that they're doing this and they're doing that then he might not be getting your taxes and they said okay so that went along with it\nSo you you they don't want you to be able to be creative so you got to be one step ahead ... if you're going to be creative creative creativity stifled\nA lot of times so this is some stuff hopefully Trump is working on trying to stop and the other thing is there there are few unknown laws which are not really laws because they're called ah they're called letters a of decision as to whether they call they're called um\n[noise] they're not in that they're not in the law of the unwritten law\nThere there is something where you get all you get a letter from the IRS saying that you can do it\nBut it's like between the one company and they are is then you take that and you can use that as an argument and ah so sometimes the these are companies have gotten permission from the IRS\nAnd then you see a senators being assaulted in airports run out of restaurants with their spouses and just people being threatened and you know it wasn't a I think stays police and Rand Paul ... be justified to this best but\nYou know at some point it it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about inciting people to violence like Eric Holder did which is a dangerous and I don't think ah I don't think we ought to reward that at all\nNow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn this administration is the more Congress nights with the president on issues such as this statement actually and United\nIt's almost like it's driving the last ... into aid uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing they are they are more and more angry\n[laughter] what is you know or the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court\nAnd they can't stand the idea that a President Trump is now Puerto two outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as\nOur confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point the presidency I'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is a driving them I think to a a true that is\nA unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThere was an interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenge or the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of cabin on the planet and get your reaction let's listen to you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have we need a Supreme Court justices who believes in voting rights a justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have\nAccess to the health care and ensures that she can he fails the bar on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed if he were important we see can meet those qualifications\nYour reaction to that\nWell I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not running for the United States Senate from Texas\nI'm he's out of step with the with Texas values and and this and every other important area my only suspicion laws he's running for the Democratic nomination for president in twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats and the hard left\nWho are who are ah we're seeing a create these the sort of mob rule\nOn the Republicans in the mid terms mean you've heard ... are very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how does things really look we'll start with the cruise said\nWell I think Ted's and that's in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this is all about turnout we know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd mid term elections we usually see down there and the turnout but uh I think the Kavanaugh hearings have energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor ... and and Tennessee said well he would have voted for a cabinet shop but I'm the truth is\nIf you elect a Democrat this mid term then we're going to jeopardize our ability to confirmed more federal judges and a Chuck turn of the Senate over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking to spend on a ... issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on my show senator to discussing what next ... when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court pack\nThe incentive to me seems to be still there for that type of circus we saw for cabinet and namely there's no\nThere's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report or or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there are no repercussions so given the fact that there were no repercussions town there hasn't been yet\nDo you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nSo I have a pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter\nAnd then they send it to the FBI after the initial um initial hearing than it was return by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee\nSo ... that are one of the uh one of the Democratic senators or their staff are the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or I'm most cats or a doctor forge warrior although she certainly did this for for a doctor for its interests very well in the way she handled all of this but yet we're gonna we're gonna get to the bottom of this or are they ...\nThey'll probably be an ethics committee investigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this because this is simply unacceptable\nAnd thank goodness we didn't reward this was a a success and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nNow I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward\nThat names when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a collaboration with outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans\nAnd how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their text messages I just think you know getting involved the ethics ... an ethics investigation is fine\nBut there is nothing like an FBI investigation really trace what happened who did it and someone is lying someone dying here\n[laughter] well I guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction of federal district whether a federal\nI hadn't really thought much about it but perhaps there is and that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been a federal crime committed I Would wholeheartedly support to that investigation by the FBI\nOr Senator John Cornyn a hearing a learning them show senator uh for the next to you know three and a half weeks on this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party\nIs more unified than it's been I don't know since when I mean it just it seems like all hands on deck\nPeople are working together they're not\nBiting each other as much and Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the presidents he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said the president will win re election Nikki Haley saying she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty or what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nA lot more optimistic that I've been in a long time Laura I mean the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darned impressive I Know the mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but\nReally this focus on the judiciary and the fact that the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become\nThe crucible and which I think that it has United Arab all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right I'm to the right\nAnd so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who did the support either Gorsuch or a cabinet shop or some of the other Democrats on the ballot Catskill McCaskill exactly in Missouri\nI'm did not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West to parents in the oval office yesterday\n[noise] I just think it's hilarious that are that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other\nCelebrities in the oval office during his time but there is a double standard as we all know for this president and I just thought it was I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that\nProfane rapper common to the White House to read poetry\nHis his stuff is filled with every expletive on earth but he was at their reading poetry so and no one ever think that we're reaching out with this wonderful it's authentic and meanwhile Trump has it's near west in there\nYou have to admit Senator Cornyn truck makes things pretty pretty unconventional and in in kind of holds up the merit of the Democrats does he not I\nI think so well it's it is just drive and he makes their heads explode and they\nAct and all sorts of or Russia irrational ways and and we've seen that look to the judicial confirmation but we saw again yesterday on\nOn TV and uh I think this or we just need to get this midterm election behind us we need to keep the house in the ... so we can continue making progress for the American people including a adding more federal judges to the bench\nWhether you're somebody needs to hire somebody who wants to get high more students who wants to

African American men who are watching them\nAnd that is in part it legitimize Donald Trump among that community and\nThere are some in the political class that find that offensive that Kanye West

think my friends and I have friends in Hollywood writers and directors and producers and actors and singers\nI think they flipped through a newspaper or read a magazine article and because they know

I'm going back and forth\nYeah so what ... did you pay off we paid a ... I think it was a Home Depot and credit card mhm\nAnd my mom and I don't remember\nOkay here's for eyes start um I I start with the premise that somewhere down inside of you know but it's not there all the time my premises is the shortest way to become wealthy is to have no payments\nHave thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nWell my my wife and I have a ... a about a hundred and forty thousand dollars in the past two and a half years good for you and what we've only\nMortgage oil three rental properties that we\nHave mortgages on [laughter] and and the two and a half years we've had a little graduate high school or college we've been paying about half the tuition would have been taken out loans the other half and I and\nI stopped contributing to a four one K. and if I got a beginner babies to say but I just feel like I'm not sure what the next I I feel like I'm\nNot doing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income about a hundred thousand okay\nSo can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school and stop the studio is\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on a these rental property as we in the past couple of years\nOkay if you um I mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into bed I Would rather pay get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there a reason they plan doesn't sound good\nYou know it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college tutor and the next two years\nOld yeah well ... maybe four or five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income and retirement five is kids college which ruined her cash flowing in this case\nAnd ah the Sixers payoffs mortgages how are you know rentals in the house and so forth but really um you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to pay on your mortgage is\nYeah which is stupid in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I should just pull out of our consumer that we should just save up a a ... for three maybe four month of merge they'd find it and then yeah and then\nThen let's let them stop taking out student loans\nAnd clear them out and then do the same with the other day and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there's money above that then we start throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two but it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn our house is tiny but then and then and that was more of your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about ... we're all about fifty sixty Seventy thousand a piece okay or immoral fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen yeah yeah and for one is only one and only twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year from now and I was going to feel good and my son is still alive and take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay Hannah there was one in there somewhere to make that maps work All right [noise] uh yeah I still I'm just going to plink along on those minimums and take care of college without that first\nOnce we got college without that then we find money we throw it at the at the probably go knock out little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\nAnd then how about ... back in the world one K. or not\nDo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now\nNow okay yeah well no so did you get your emergency fund right yeah emergency fund is maybe step three and then by the Senate forest Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those other two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack maybe steps four five six in order\nActually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then of course money left we keep going down the list and the next thing on the list\nSome of the news is that logical yeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before then stripped him tree or two and three I guess technically you're given five or ... yeah yeah yeah and you and your skip three to yeah [laughter] so so yeah you're around\nIn which you're back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nHi Mr ... the it's an honor to talk to you how can I have a question for you okay\nUm we have our house currently on the market right now we listed it ends alive for two Fifteen [noise] um [noise] I Know there is not an ill in our area\n[noise] um [noise] we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [noise] we've had only one going we've had\nHundreds of heads on line [noise] um [noise] what are struggling with here that we paid one fifty for the house the average stays on the market in my area as three hundred and sixty nine\nLord what is wrong area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural Pennsylvania we have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half a million [noise]\nUm and then ... and so that's a vacation because it's on a lake or on water on a on a dream\nBut I'm a realtor than that our houses kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know so you're not in hiding out in Harrisburg proper them\nNo no I'm In like northeast yesterday a up near up near New York border but\nSo your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yes the\nDummy three or six to nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in\nI mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff right and you just have a limited market I don't know what to do your other than\nA is there anyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort is or is there a a real her up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere the kind of\nSpecializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives or they're just not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates their resort area\nThe higher and stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a highfalutin realtor I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need to get it where we have an hour drive to work we can't do it anymore yeah OK three kids you know we're on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like we just say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices are promo or you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at it\nThey're looking at it on line\nAll their workers or not they're not clients are lurking they're just like the picture flip through them in the ... where it was I walked away they were not client's\nLocation killed him was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor I'm saying that others are\nOf our house but double the law you know\nBut he found a buyer or ... I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this was a really tough one\nI mean do I pick another well Oh yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and it says gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there and the fringe\nAt under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your real tourist the person that can do that\nThis is that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel them down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area\nAnd that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you and that a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work this area\nA central ... it's a very unique\n\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches or being reported every\nDay and hundreds of millions of people about their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy though I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked\nOut when they become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans to find out really quick how unprotected they are in so many ways that's why ... says Anders id theft plan to\nOur benefit package was such a smart move the Sanders plan covers all types of ID theft takes over all the work and even covers your bank account if it gets act\nHe wasn't that way on one\nOf those that was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you why did they ran the\nBoard and again I mean I\nCan ... with your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the force anyone\nWhat's your wired it was really difficult to to give out something that\nYou know what I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that but it also kind of

to get in the way but I don't want to discount them personal finances personal\nAnd so I don't want my wife's owner diamond ring the you know that's ... that's personal and that's reasonable\nOkay as an example okay and so we didn't sell it when we were going broke there you go when they're better dominoes or didn't matter but um you know the same thing here so I guess what you need a backup from and say uh\nLike being the algae about things I'm getting old I liked legacy things I like old things that other people in that I loved touched inhaled and treasured I like having those things in my life I was a little bit difficult to be nostalgic about its large\nOr is this ... like a lot of land with it is it multiple generation or is it just a subdivision house and I happen to be where he grew up\nIt um does heavenly him with it and it's where he grew up in the issue comes in with um I Would love to have the house\nRight now are um Oregon is very affordable and it's allowing a separate babies have very quickly mhm whereas if we um perjure for home or take over the payment for her\nThat would be um oh my God Boeing\nCorner and so what is our White House burned down by how much is our house probably aren't going hungry okay and what your old take home pay these hundred in my ... well\nIt is but it's within the quarter that we talk about a fourth of your income going forth of your

medically or if it's just you know prayed and and they might be a fun neurologist do solid we got 'em Medicaid down\nAnd just try to put more flash stay healthy and try to save a little bit of money but until I found you a lot I didn't even you know the discipline Middle East have\nOkay so you're you're right but you were able to go back to work in good\nFaith and that's going to be a big relief how old are you\nA ... wow what caused the brain injury uh fortunately or as a full but not really focusing on that just\nSure either we was just curious the man you've been through hell okay so you you you're you were down out they cleaned out everything did you follow bankruptcy\nYou um my discharge of actually like sweet\nCheap all the chapter seven\nWhere you cleared off all the debt okay did

you maybe you can go across back from a brain injury you've come all the way back congratulations thank the lord I got a guy who shoot at a pretty good so how do you start over you start over a\nWiser\nA less naive about\nYou that you know you know ended up in the bankruptcy its reminder to avoid that right\nAnd we know that an outside variable a horrible tragedy\nUh caused your financial trouble but had you had a pile of cash and absolutely no doubt at all you probably could have survived that so that's our new goal is to become wealthy without any debts\nAnd so as life uh lives opportunities and problems come along you're in better shape to tackle either and so how can we quickly most quickly rebuild your financial life now that you're rebuilding your overall life\nAnd uh that's the stuff you're hearing me teach every day that get on a written planet budget\nA void that build up an emergency fund and then begin investing long term um and as you're able to get out on your own again medically and financially you will do that to re establish yourself as a you know a\nSingle young twenty eight year old guy that doesn't live at home or no shame in that game right now but a long term you'll want to be out right just like you want to have the dignity of your whole life uh so\nThat's a cool thing uh but you know the basic stuff we talk about here saving for

fault that don't mean that but my goodness gracious man you're you're cool I'm Glad I'm proud for you you're doing good stuff hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we'll get you into financial peace university Michelle was in Watertown South Dakota Hi Michelle how are you\nAre in good shape thank you for taking my call certainly how can I help\n[noise] um well I just started your program and August I'm I have currently paying down three thousand dollar that um that just got to actually that's the average making payments on a monthly payments on how\nI'm right now I Need to fat on my phone collection but you're getting out I think ... dollars mhm\n[noise] and I've already received a lot of like settlements in the mail mhm or less like I had a friend king hundred dollar bills that there there are are that made her take funding hundred for a friend of mine like kind of relieved that\nThousand dollars that were given mhm that I have to pay taxes on that at the end of the year and I was just wondering if it's true\nThat is true forgiveness except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that\nThey forgave I'm okay so what's your household income\n[noise] um [noise] it it's an area and I married at about how about forty five thousand is here\nOkay so let's let's say you're out and wanting percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you too\nSo a good deal what's your yeah your I have about two hundred dollars per thousand for that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that as I follow through on that but and the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so\nYeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have and in addition to that now if you had a large returning coming because you're over withholding\nOiled and in that case so you're just going to lower your return because you need to change your withholding anyway so good question\nThank you for joining U.S

who are emotionally mature enough to handle the numbers I don't tell a four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten and tell it\nOkay and they're not emotionally capable of handling that information our children in our case did not know our wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their early twenties it was shocking\nTo them because they were raised like regular people but\nSo I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about\nBut then as we presented to them it was presented as a responsibility\n'cause I was for me and my house we sort of the\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just managing have forgotten\nWell they

daycare on that it wouldn't lose money she basically be working for daycare and health insurance but mainly um when he's not going to end just not twenty five hundred dollars a month but it is probably going to be a you know Fifteen hundred isn't it\nYeah come to the Eighteen 'cause one will be born\nYou know cut out to babysit okay yeah I'm All right uh and what do you do for a living\nI'm In sales or my wife works for the state wouldn't you sell 'em as controlling termites or stuff like that mhm\nAnd that your company has a branch and the other city\nOh yeah and we're throughout the

don't like that formula much get how you're going there but I think you need to decide where you live based on the quality of life based on I Want to be near family based on the job that I Want is their land we figure out a babysitter\nI'm it sounds like you're following mom around a little bit I don't mean that in a negative way I mean it just yeah it's just a babysitter thing is drawing un

to the lenders so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the core worn out to the point is going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it\nOther words a hundred thousand miles dodged neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nWhy one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point I mean do they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay\nIt's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well built I mean ... again a Honda Lexus a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on it when thinking about that\nUh it's got easily another hundred in it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing [noise]\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we can depends on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or not got the got about fifty something on it\nAnd um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day and um\nSo you know you just you're looking at that your situation to what is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the the I'm\nMore of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it um because I'm just I'm just really don't know how can I just look at words dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in\nThank you for taking my call Sherman what's up\nI'm Seventeen and go on a haiku emir I've got about three thousand dollars and count how down there and said I Am back in my view in China and\nYou're going to college\n[noise] yeah I mean to college with an H ... program in St Louis and the olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program maybe transfer but no five of the Caribbean I keep them at the community colleges they dined and you're right I Know of course yeah yeah\nI Will be true if you get some search someone certifications and stuff and I the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that\nOn crime so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer you want to be an hour or whatever it was okay uh and the community college is paid for\nAs long as you keep an eye plus um you can invest it ah here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am more than you have an investment a mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine finish college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money\nTo finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and as a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\n... field of study that you can you know really make some good money in and the\nYou know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know me I talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account at this stage\nWhat this amount of money in your situation\nBecause again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree\nIn your field of study whether it's a two year or the certifications in the tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools and your belt for you to be able to go live your dream without any that\nAnd that three thousand dollar spent on that is more important than than the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nOn Gray Davis an honor to speak with you you\nToo sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward they can prepare for retirement and we're using the access in our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension take nine percent of our gross take home pay our dilemma is when we said an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine prevent that we're already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from August coloration so when we say ... percent were able to save a lot for a mortgage into racism or is it okay to do that or am recommend saving their twenty four\nPercent now they they mandatory amount that you're putting in a ... or you vested in that is that a a huge choosing an investment for that or as a pension\nAt the end and there's no options you know it's it's mandatory it's a pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty thousand or a okay ah innocent nine percent nine percent\nOkay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that\nCorrect correct okay I probably would split the difference because I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly wrong state and now we're better than all those guys [laughter]\nOh yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line or if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we can do this before then that means we need to put in ten percent\nRight you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some odd but I mean likelihood as I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension and Illinois it's just horribly wrong and if it was ever going to file anywhere to be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that so a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and goes round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it you know it's a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction\nSo um [noise]\n[noise] you know go do it that that's what that's what I Would go back it up a little

things doesn't it they feel that way\nI think that [noise]\nIndividual and the media a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about offing Hooper natural a good and evil\nAre also in tradition at its heart of the time and ah in the tradition partition of at the\nVeil of\nThis time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but these things that I deal with happen all the time\nAnd um but the media pays more attention to it this time of year and that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world\nAnd also on the other side I think is really important\nHere for using demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of being read about certain things do you think demonic spirits have something to do with that\nDefinitely are we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth and this is a huge target for demonic spirits\nAnd also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people that have power\nCan change the world for good or for ill\nAnd uh I think that there's never been a time in our history where demons have a greater opportunity to strike\nAt the common person and\nAlso people who are very influential and so they were around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey on what is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nA demonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counterpart of angels\nThat powerful they are not regular people who have died just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they are very involved and may have not\nEver lived in the physical realm or not have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect\nPhysical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd uh we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a\nFrom Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people it's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that are under the attack of ah demonic spirits\nNegative spirits and ah\nSpirits are are able to reach in to the physical realm\nFrom the non physical route and actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit in a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are much better equipped\nTo ah influence people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can see them and tell a path ethically trans for information\nInto our system our emotional systems make us angry at each other\nGet us to do things we would not normally do and we can see them we don't know that there are there\nSee that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many\nDemonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirit it's also true that demonic spirits a can change you know once\nThey were no positive experience in their ego got to them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack of\nSo many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits and all spirit\nDo not have voice boxes\nThey communicate George ... ethically and we all communicate ... kind of like a river that travels underneath our consciousness\nAnd they communicate on that level and they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in and it's also very common\nAnd are they trying to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits but they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sore negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative thing is when they were alive and continue to do negative things demonic spirits are very powerful and as an exorcist when I'm dealing with them on experience I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's what they can they can come and get you\nOh abs and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect that when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes negative feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking for it or that the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work\nForty seven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times for shorter rations and it's very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form\nAt a moment's notice can you see them\nI can you ... I was born with the ability to see spirits I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school in grade school\nI thought I saw spirits in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with a school work and some are looking at me like how can you see me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and these are the lawn I had to watch out for and they'd actually come\nAnd start walking towards me in the classroom when I was very uncomfortable\nStay with us Jeffrey we're going to hit a break and we're gonna come back and talk more about these demonic spirits where do they come from what they want and then next\nGoes to insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for iPhone and now Android ... on demand anywhere any time I go to coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\nI Love it needs to be honest I think the bad thing I have a nine Marion for unions everyday on your favorite ... make a fifty dollar Omar Franklin ... and you get a free makeup that tree out I'm a member of the\nTank I tell her mind so you can help in cancer research foundation by making an impact on me than any\nMental saying everything getting tired and I said family I think\n... in ... when we try to come aboard stuff so I had I lodged top condition killer\nHelped Saddam to stop talking kind of Bora it's just incredible feeling stuff on the left will be full of just ... when I have the ... to know how long slide on something amazing happened which will taste while I'm On a contract is\nStaggering about this one is the thing that you can check to hold off on ...\nOn a forum that's where he knows that made it all started coming through like a kinda barbaric ... excuse the pun\nTwo dollars so here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system and he says he'll this gentleman's hauling\nThe immune system can be called one of the bodies fears is powers to he'll visit C. A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com\nEight six six eight three six eight seven three five\nThat's one eight six six eight seven six eight seven three five\n[noise]\n\nJeffrey ... with us as we talk about demons we'll take calls next to our as well before we get into open lines Jeffrey what do you think their end game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a natural human\nHumans they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so ah they attack ...\nChildren in their cribs ... attack people at work a tech everybody we all have targets on her back and we need to realize that\nWe can see them but they can see us they generate negative emotional energies they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand what they're trying to do it don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that in Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but the reality is\nIs that they are around us spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them and they communicated with us ... either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family\nTo destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy your business\nAnd you destroy a person's ability to make money destroyed their family destroy their lives\nAnd also check to change or the way we think about each other right now they have both at each other's throats\nRight where they want to\nFail they sure do know\nAnd we have to stop it and there's there's ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying and it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nEverybody I've talked to has some kind of a story of uh being in a home apartment condo a party a bar in a pub any ... any place\nOr the scene or felt something strange or picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can\nInfluence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying are feeling\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not\nNormally do that and some of them were angry bathroom they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them\nThey are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not most spirits are good summer not\nSo the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue\nTo hang around our world and\nIt has to do things they would not normally do demonic spirits are just experts at it they have weapons they have devices that they make off of non physical energy is just like spirits do spirits change their forms\nLike our our parents die as an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating\nIn thinking about generating a form of what they wanted to look like and also generating close 'cause most people do not see naked spirit so all these things are generated on a non physical level\nEmotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well\nSo demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and\nFocus in on us and generate hatred enrage\nWe think it's our own\nBut it's not always completely our own or the under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular spirit in charge of following negative spirits I demonic spirits are kind of like criminals they really don't even get along with each other\nThey don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always the rule uh they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this\nUh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time working on individuals and families are getting them to fight\nUh getting people to fight with each other or getting countries to fight with each other or getting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage and very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally uh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light all come out on attack I pulled out my non physical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody's not so fortunate that they can see them and know that they're coming\nAnd so there are around us and we don't know it around us that work and at home also negative spirit you know and negative spirits can work for them essentially and and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not the ones that are not\nAre also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time\nAnd lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so essentially the entire human race right now is under attack\nBy negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier may not have ever lived in the physical realm\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice\nOh how to generate hatred and rage and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura\nAnd to get us to react to they're\nAngry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially\nKill a child in the cradle no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought\n... horrible they have they just hate humans\nSo they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves and their world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize\nThat we need to protect ourselves from this we need to stop being so angry with each other\nBecause we're being used and it's not just\nAnd all that go on ... so you know now you're hungry income soon we're going to be looking for it\n[noise]\n\nChevrolet

email me certainly sage loosen up emotional energy it loses up negative emotional energy soldiers Franken sense ... there's many substances that were very very well loosening up\nEnergy is kind of like spring something\nOn the wall to get something off of it but it doesn't along get rid of the home see that's the problem is is that the\nAge or release it\nOut into the atmosphere but it will not moving from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down\nInto the earth and away from the property\nIn order for it to be removed because essentially what I think it's going on here to Jay ... you've been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things stage\nFrankenstein and all of these things you know I recommend them certainly but we're releasing them into the atmosphere they still have to be released from and pushed out from the home in order for them to be out of your life and I think it was going on is that is just accumulated\nA to the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things you know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nAnd to some extent\nBut emotional energy in negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know taking the Bruins pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan\nGet the you know a broom and get it in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for that now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy Jeffrey\nPeople generate both positive and a ... a negative emotional energy is from the very first day that were orange shortage\nAnd these things can become trapped in our bodies energy fields also known as the ... but the order is not just a bunch of pretty light it is who we are as part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is our spirit or maybe three or four feet\nOutside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped in over a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue\nSo emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy fields and we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home I'm watching TV\nTubs every place there is emotional energy enter bunnies energy fields have we don't protect ourselves and most people don't that it actually permeates into our energy field and\nMixes with our own emotional energy\nPositive and negative and causes havoc [noise] and this is one of the biggest problems that people who call me have it's not it was just the amount of experience\nThe idea is that we are filled full of emotional energy on the positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to let go and [noise] and so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy in negative emotional energy is something that\nUh people want to release\nI bet they feel a hundred percent better when it's natural let's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Teri go ahead\nYeah George or ideas why I'm a it was the original language or the scriptures and um my actually writing a book called the we really do shot\nIs and I tell you the Bible in Nineteen eighty stay with I've dealt with a lot of the party a theme and while I was going to ask\nYou Jeffrey are you a Christian\nI don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God I also think that ah the argument over creationist a series and a truly scientific physical theories as ridiculous they pull work hand in hand\nFirst prince will is creation spirits don't just sit around them clouds and do and do nothing higher spirits angels God you know they create almost like a bat or of a cake\nOn a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical ... non physical\nProceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely but also the big bang theory why not so it's essentially like I said like baking a cake you know that spirit guide angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating an designing these things potentially right now as we speak not just in the beginning of time but right now and that filters up\nIt's connected with the physical all things physical so each person has to levels\nOf physical body which is very finite sixty eighty years or Fifteen Years or whatever and our spirit which is completely eternal enter personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that are not that you have but I mean that is\nBeing fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with I'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially so I Believe in all of this is science to me\nYou know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think when you're doing this marvelous you know I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to their question go ahead Jerry\nYeah what I was going to say is you're talking about religion religion ages ... and the guy go to church give your money do this don't\nUm is is that we have many ministers out there that age\nUh this type of stuff and basically do they make money off the guy\nThe problem is with the with the whole scenario at the turn it off like you Jeffrey\nAnd and I understand that I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know that but you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it it's a relationship between you and God now why is that\nWill be an arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus the title is Jean ... Lord Jesus Christ lord and have the gene means humanity or I mean the only did one\nOkay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on the third in fact in fact heater said that I'm a ... ... that God is no respect or person but we're all in the same boat\nNo matter how much knowledge we know we're all the same boat with God\nBecause we have a major because we're we're born and then because of Adam's then because we carry at him and uh our entire life we we are and have you been all that is that that none of a third of the glory of God we were all on the same boat\nBut those demons seemed to be everywhere we're gonna come back and take final calls in a moment off the coast to coast am\nHosting signers the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for I'm pulling in now enjoyed for ... listen live or on demand anywhere any time to go to coast to coast am done calm and downloaded today\nI mean if you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness it's possible you could\nAdd a trio the relation one of the leading causes a strobe light out before the late ... cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal device than just Ninety nine dollars to order is a cardiac ... then you can have our D.

California is with us say Thomas\nGeorge thank you for taking my call sir panacea for a great work that you're doing carefree my question is about war and a battle field and more sounds\nHow does a military personnel men and women in a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica fault I'm not talking about just\nBattling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a wartime battle field situation and you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago um and seriously there are methods there are rules on the other side [noise]\nEmotional energy that we all generate and and it is in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a a place for negative fares are attracted to him on experience negative spears as well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy field there are methods\nTheir rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us from the facts that negative energy that is generated by other people\nFear around us we're just not true in a battle situation [noise] ah emotional energy that just you know so intense on the battlefield\nThere are a lot of a poll layers that can be applied that actually work\nSo that negative energy actually bounces off of this\nAnd so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves and the military you just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple and it can take this stuff I designed over the years\nWith the help of my spirit guides have you brought up in five or ten seconds\nIt needed fast you know the old style was doing things ten minutes in the morning in ten minutes in the evening I read all that stuff when I got out of the service\nTen minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we need we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us\nWe need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect negative emotional energy or this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also are off the fear and here and so I think that it's very important that we all learn that this kind of thing and it's a science it's not a religion what ... what I'm involved in is not religion\nI Would not even to say is really a metaphysical is non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say\nScientists to not call me up and to argue with me they are right\nI deal with non physical

Rome or are they from\nTwo schools of thought there's some that believe that they're simply and only human beings ancient pagan royalty existed maybe going back to the time even before the flood and the that they were able to survive the flood and then continued with new bloodlines after the time of the flood\nThe second point is that they are and this comes from the Bible as well as the dead sea scrolls that they are celestial beings light being ephemeral beings who had the ability to phase into physical manifestation they could take flesh and blood bodies\nAnd face back and forth by the way between flesh and blood and their their light being status\nAnd then infiltrated human affairs\nThat sounds to me when\nThey are and this is where it gets kind of disturbing because as you think it began to research the watchers it's you're presented with a crossroads you're either going to take the tack that they are purely evil and their demonic as many people do\nAnd if you take that path it's going to lead you down to the path where you're following their offspring who recalled than to feel them as these giant beans with the Longate its goals and in this whole axis of research which is very interesting\nBut if you're following that path chances are you are not probing deeply behind the tax and into the tax\nLeft by the scenes and you're realizing that the the uh seems themselves\nWere utilizing ancient tax and teachings that they had developed in synthesized from ancient Babylon Egypt Iran Iraq the teachings of the factors\nThat were centered on how do we contact the watchers\nOne and two how do we transform ourselves into angels and in fact this is what the Dead Sea scrolls are all about is this is seen this group of the scenes Jewish mistakes a hundred and fifty years of where the time of Jesus who were utilizing these teachings\nTo congregate with the angels the holy ones the angels are the lord\nA watchers and work transforming their bodies into\nLight in other words into angels\n... which of course in the book of genesis\nTo me there ... I'm not sure what do you think\nI I don't think so because when you look at the at a mile or G. of the ... the meaning of the word ... it's far far from established fact the term fallen angel is ... means that the are evil beings or that they are being who were are somehow demonic\nThey their fallen because they came out of the higher vibration or if you will heavenly realms\nAnd took human body fat is they're great sin they crossed with the church establishment views as a forbidden boundary you're not allowed to cross over from flesh into spirit with out God's permission\nAnd this is the whole crux of the question did the watchers when they descended from the heavenly realms and took on physicality\nAgainst the will of God and that that's going to determine your whole viewpoint about the watchers and what happened was that early church fathers based on some of the work of the scenes and others simply decided that they were\nDemonic being that they were a powers that were beyond human control and certain humans began teaching that we need to avoid the watchers at all cost do not seek to transform yourself into an angel without God's permission because then\nThe or experience the rapture you have to be invited by God and that's the great crossing the line that the watchers transcended are crossed over and came to teach humans and how to do how to turn into angels\nWilliam in your book to watch as you do talk about a luminous clouds were gods rode on them to me it sounds like ... we'll it sounds kind of you and foolish doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean in in the New Testament the Greek word for clouds this new field which is the word where we get the word into feeling from and so these are cloud riders and when you as I did in my book and and the watchers book I collected\nVarious examples of today are Judeo Christian art that shows the watchers including a Jesus riding upon cloud vehicles luminous clouds they're literally levitating on these clouds\nAnd what we learn is that this cloud is actually a symbol for\nTheir ascension body they're light Audi it's it's not a hardware UFO like a a flying Toyota it's actually an organic light vehicle that is produced by the human body and it enables them to travel entered dimensional ally and throughout the cosmos\nTalking with William Henry whose latest words the watchers and of course we're going to get into many things that he is an investigative miss all it just goes after these God that a visited us\nSpiritual physical\nSpiritual first who had the ability to phase into physicality and their bodies are described actually has fluid they can virtually instantly according to these stories\nTransform from their acquiesce adaptable kind of a fluid shape into physicality they can even turn invisible\nAnd this is what we we discover and in some of the ... tax as well as in the dead sea scrolls where there were they're describing looking at these luminous beings who are radiating rainbow light\nWho their bodies are described as full of buys they're covered with feathers and they have serpent teen type faces\nAnd when you add all this description together it precisely matches with the Tibetans describe as the rainbow body of light\nIn the Tibetan great perfection tradition they believe that humans can morph into a light body that they describe that what they tell us that are the the body the frequency of our body can be accelerated until it dissolves into five color rainbow light leaving behind only hair toe in fingernails\nAnd have no nerves to be transmitted the watchers could do this and I believe that the the Tibetan great perfection tradition of originates with the watchers\nAnd so these watchers could could step down their frequency in a way to enter into the earth plain tuna or tone down their frequency manifest in physical form and then face back into their non physical light being for well\nWhat did they want William was there an agenda\nAnd it's a place where everybody knows your name you get all this for one price under one roof only got metro fitness metro fitness dot com\n[noise]\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control so this is W.

professional psychic exorcist teacher specializes in the clearing of individuals' homes businesses a psychic protection\nJeffrey is also an expert on Huntington's in homes and businesses psychic abilities good goals such as spirit guides as well and we're tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks for having me back on your show the fifth time and a big outlaw everybody around our whole planet\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring out ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that\nIndividual and the media have a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about offing Hooper natural a good and evil a tradition at its heart of the time and a and the tradition her just\nOh I'm of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but these things that I deal with happen all the time\nAnd um but the media pays more attention to it this time of year and that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever use demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of being read about certain things do you think demonic spirits have something to do with that\nDefinitely are we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target for demonic spirits and also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people that have power\nAnd can change the world for good or for ill\nAnd uh I think that there was never been a time in our history where demons have a greater opportunity to strike\nAt the common person and\nAlso people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey on one is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nA demonic spirit is a very very powerful\nSpirit it could be said that there was a counterpart of angels that powerful they are not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not\nLived in the physical realm or not have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect\nPhysical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd uh we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a\nFrom Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people it's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that are under the attack of\nAh demonic spirits negative spirits and ah demonic spirits are\nAble to reach in to a physical around\nFrom the non physical route and actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit in a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are much better equipped\nTo ah influence people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can see them and tell a path ethically trends for information\nInto our system\nAt each other other people at our cells get us to do things we would not normally do and we can't see them we don't know that there are there\nShe that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many demonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as ego I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirits\nIt's also true that demonic spirits a can change you know once they were no positive experience in their ego got to them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh\nThe real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nOf so many arguments you know between people today\nAnd they take advantage of that and spirits and all spirits\nDo not have voice boxes they communicate George ... ethically\nAnd we all communicate ... ethically it's kind of like a river that travels underneath our consciousness\nAnd they communicate on that level and they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in and it's also very common\nAnd are they trying to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits but they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sort negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative thing is when they were alive and continue to do negative things demonic spirits are very powerful and it's an exorcist when I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's you know they can come and get you\nOh abs and they do and [noise] the thing is is that they come when you least expect that when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes negative feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking for it or that the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work\nForty seven

or form at a moment's notice\nCan you see them I can you ... I was born with the ability to see spirits I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school in grade school I thought I saw spirits in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help from the school work and some are looking at me\nLike how can you see me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and these are the lawn I had to watch out for and they actually come and start walking towards me in the classroom when I was very uncomfortable\nAren't stay with us Jeffrey we're

take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nDestruction of the human race uh\nThat's all humans\nHumans they want nothing from of so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so ah they attack\nChildren in their cribs ... attack people at work\nIt tech everybody we all have targets on her back and we need to realize that we can see them but they can see us they generate negative emotional energies they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand what\nThey're trying to do it don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but the reality is\nIs that they are around the spirits around us all the time we just can't see them and they communicated with us tell a path to be the end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family\nTo destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy your business and you destroy a person's ability to make money destroyed their family destroy their lives\nAnd also check to change or the way we think about each other right now they have both at each other's throats right where they want to\nSell they sure do there's no\nAnd we have to stop it and there's there's ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying that it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nEverybody I've talked to has some kind of a story of ah being in a home apartment condo a party or ... or ... any ... any place\nOr the scene or felt something strange or picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can\nInfluence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying are feeling\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that\nI Would not normally do that and so when we're angry that's when they attack important people making decisions around ...\nOr they don't know that there are there and they may not believe in them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not most spirits are good summer not\nAnd so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue\nTo hang around our world and it is to do things he would not normally do demonic spirits are just experts at it they have weapons they have devices that they make off of non physical energy is just like spirits do\nSpirits change their forms like our our parents die as an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by gender reading\nAnd thinking about generating a form of what they wanted to look like and also generating close because most people do not see\nNaked spirit so all these things are generated on a non physical level emotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well so demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred enrage\nWe think it's our own but it's not always completely our own are they under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular\nSpirit in charge of all negative spirits I demonic spirits are kind of like criminals they really don't even get along with each other\nThey don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always the rule\nUh they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this\nUh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time working on individuals and families are getting them to fight uh getting people to fight with each other or getting countries to fight with each other or\nGetting people to amplify what\nWould normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage and very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally uh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of a very negative\nA beam of light all come out on an attack I pull out my non physical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on but everybody's not so fortunate that they can see them and know that they're coming\nAnd so there are around us and we don't know it around us that work and at home\nAlso negative spirit you know and in negative spirits can work for them essentially\nAnd and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not are also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time\nAnd lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so\nEssentially the entire human race right now is under attack by negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier may not have ever lived in the physical realm\nPractice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura\nAnd to get us to react to they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially kill a child in the cradle no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought\n... horrible they have they just have humans\nSo they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves\nAnd their world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize that we need to protect ourselves from this we need to stop being so angry with each other\nBecause we're being used\nIt's a lower interest loan or zero interest credit card a as the can help you get out of debt

it out into the atmosphere but it will not removed from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down\nInto the earth and away from the property in order for it to be removed because essentially what I think it's going on here to Jay has he been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things stage\nFrankenstein and all of these things you recommend them certainly but where it releasing them into the atmosphere they still have to be released from and pushed out from the home in order for them to be out of your life and I think what's going on is that it's just accumulated a to the point where it's all around you\nAnd you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things you know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nAnd to some extent but emotional energy negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know taking the room and pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan\nGet the you know a broom and get it in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for that now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy jeopardy\nPeople generate all positive animal a negative emotional energy is from the very first day that were born shortage\nAnd these things can become trapped in our bodies energy fields also known as the ... but the order is not just a bunch of pretty light it is who we are as part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is our spirit or maybe three or four feet\nOutside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped over a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue so emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy fields\nAnd we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant\nAmerican television um you know a tubs every place there is emotional energy energy ... energy field to be doing protect ourselves\nAnd most people don't that it actually permeates into our energy field and mixes with our own emotional energy\nPositive and negative and causes havoc and this is one of the biggest problems that people would call me have it's not it was just demonic spirits the idea is that we are filled full of emotional energy on the positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to let\nGo and and so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy in negative emotional energy is something that people want to release\nI bet they feel a hundred percent better when it's natural let's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Teri go ahead\nYeah George or I guess why I'm a it was the original language of the scriptures and I'm a actually writing a book called that we really do Scott\nIs and I studied the Bible in banks the newly stay with I've dealt with a lot as a party a theme and while I was going to ask\nYou Jeffrey are you a Christian I don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God I also think that ah the argument over creationist a series and a true scientific physical theories as ridiculous they pull work hand in hand\nFirst prince will is creation spirits don't just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing\nHigher spirits angels God you know they create almost like a ... of a cake\nOn a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical filled in non physical proceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely but also the big bang theory why not\nSo it's essentially like I said like baking a cake you know the spirits God angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating an designing these things potentially right now as we speak not just in the beginning of time but right now and that filters up it's connected with a physical all things physical so each person has to levels\nOf physical body which is very finite sixty eight years or Fifteen Years or whatever and our spirit which is completely eternal enter personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that or not you have but I mean that is\nBeing fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with I'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially so I Believe in all of this is science to me you know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure\nYou know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think when you're doing this marvelous you know I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation in needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to the jury for their question go ahead Terry [noise]\nUh yeah what I was going to say is you're talking about religion religion\nYou do this don't do that that not from guy the problem is is that we have many ministers out there that each a ... a type of stuff then basically do they make money off the guy the problem is with the with the whole scenario as it turned off like you Jeffrey\nAnd and I understand that I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know this\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion if it if it's a relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell to be an arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus is title is Jesus is Lord Jesus Christ lord and have the genes this means humanity cry means anointed why okay who\nWhat happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on the third in fact in fact ... said that I'm a ... that God is no respect or person so we're all in the same boat\nNo matter how much knowledge we know we're all in the same boat with God\nBecause we have is the nature because we're we're born and then because of Adam's then because we carry out of then ah our entire life we we are and have you been

California is with us say Thomas\nCharge thank you for taking my call sir here for a great work that you're doing carefree my question is about war and the battle field and more sounds how does\nMilitary personnel men and women\nIn a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica fault I'm not talking about just\nBattling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a wartime battle field situation\nAnd you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago um and seriously there are methods there are rules on the other side\nEmotional energy that we all generate and and is in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a a place where negative for sort of tracked it to monitor spirits negative spears as well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy field there are methods\nTheir rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us from the effects that negative energy that is generated by other people\nFear around us were just natural and the battle situation [noise]\nUh emotional energy that just you know so intense on the battlefield there are multiple layers that can be applied that actually work\nThis is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves and the military you just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple\nAnd it can take this stuff I designed over the years with the help of my spirit guides\nAnd he brought up in five or ten seconds\nIt needed fast you know the old style was doing things tend to minutes in the morning in ten minutes in the evening I read all that stuff when I got into the service ten minutes in the morning in ten minutes and evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we didn't we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us we need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately\nIn order to deflect negative emotional energy or this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also are off the fear and here so I think that it's very important that we all learn that this kind of thing and it's a science it's not a religion what uh what I'm involved in is not religion\nI Would not even to say is really a metaphysical is non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say\nScientists to not call me up and argue with me they are right now I deal with non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body are emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body\nThat is susceptible to attack and also negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scariest situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nDo it in order to destroy a person's life a\nFabric of the family and the best way to do it is to pull out the resources money charged to get it out if they destroyed a business\nAnd they have a two fold thing going on and they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home it can cause people to lose their place or where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react sometimes violent Lee\nAnd also it has an effect upon the actual business environment we're now you have a failed business I think of most restaurants they fail within a year so restaurant after restaurant come sooner business after business comes in\nAnd you have problem is a failed businesses and that has an accumulation of emotional energy as well\nPlus you have all the people working uh who don't necessarily get along is kind of like our our second family we're a family at home and we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along\nAnd so essentially have a lot of emotional energy people at work were sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here when they're doing that they're generating emotional energy\nAnd it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes as negative and accumulates in the environment this also attracts negative spirits and demonic spirits\nBecause if they can get somebody fired by you know doing or saying something uh you know inappropriate more uh you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making of a the\nShe only everybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub a business a restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right once they're picking up on George's emotional energy\nWhether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on everybody has the story of this place doesn't feel right is emotional energy needs to be cleared out so they attack businesses because they can actually make a business failed\nAnd you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work and now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others\nWith their kids

I\nWill say that people with this condition aren't seeing hear it from another round and I find it very interesting that so I'm On the spectrum costs a lot about seeing God he's this and then another side\nWill talk about demonic here it is my first question the second question is I've been seeing numbers on the clock\nAnd addresses a triple numbers for awhile Georgians had um multiple gas that

to call me because there's some things about your retirement plans that you don't\nKnow or if you do know that you can fix\nBecause there's some uh for example did you realize that if you're working in the hospital in this city most of the plans as long as you're working will not let you take it withdrawn unless it's like uh the\nUh what's it called a hardship and then you might not be able to take more than five thousand dollars I drive\nYou can borrow up to a five or ten thousand dollars ... on your own money paying interest on your own money which is not a whole lot of money when you're paying interest on it but\nI have nurses and folks all the time who are like in their sixties that cut down to like partial a retirement and they can't get a dollar out of their retirement at work because they have to be Seventy and I asked\n... to get the money so these are things that need correcting and Donald Trump's working on it so shame on you medical people out there that are setting

my grandfather\nNinety seven years old first time he was ever in the hospital got kicked out\nThat really took a turn off of the nurse you know it was a I don't know how to [laughter] ... oh yeah yeah I I had to plug that in there because I've been having problems with that these nurses and bless their cells they when they retire they they don't have to they shouldn't have to\nCompletely stop their job because like greedy investment company has a smoker that hospital uh-huh into allowing them to sign a contract with them they are the forbid them to take the money out to the seven and a half\nTheir in their star but so what do they mean four one K. benefits they're going to be more regulated and they'll they'll they can take money out these for all three babies they're not as regulated\nAnd these four fifty seven there they're not as regulators so they they can paint them that way so there's a lot of things that we can do so if say like a student wanted to pay off their ah

team is in our studios good morning guys\nHey good morning everybody's got a great show a lot to talk about and that a lot of new things in the news this week also Dale I Know a\nLot of uh you know of course the the weather nobody can predict that what's going on there but a lot of other things in the news in one of the biggest things especially as you know that when a hurricane like that comes about on shore like that who has insurance who does not that's one of the biggest questions and it was always wanted a big topic\nThat is hey so if you don't have what would that be called the hurricane hit your home but the water floods it and you don't have flood insurance does that mean that the water did the damage or the wind did the damage or does it matter I guess it doesn't matter if you're if you're an insurance company\nWe going to have an insurance expert on that is a ... a good point there that try to answer all these intriguing questions that we have and of course ... talking about hurricane Michael to hit the panhandle of Florida then came up in Alabama and Georgia then to the Carolinas\nGot some more rain you know like they needed it stride but our thoughts and prayers are with all those that were affected and well I mean that was a category for\nWhen they came ashore was the highest category seven no it's five but it was during right there it was just like two miles below category five status so I mean it was a monster and of course\nYou've seen the video and I made it looks like a bomb went off the electrical\nBeach I I've never I Can't they say it's right there is it it's in the ... kind of going down the Florida Panhandle\nYeah towards Appalachian coal here so yeah\nI get mad if you noticed one thing on the news coverage a lot of that coverage was was a captured by drones I don't know if you are oh you know that that's why they got so much information so much coverage of what actually happened because of some of these drones you ought to see the quality was incredible they can pinpoint exactly what was going\nOff well you can see the structures to guys you can see some of the the some of the homes I mean ... ... and they look ... and I still that brand new so they must have built them different then\nSomebody else it had been there a long time\n... it's a lot of the older homes that were destroyed but the newer construction I mean the code of change obviously over I mean that's like I was hearing in Mexico beach I mean there was a lot of mobile homes down there but they have an ordinance now that there can be no more mobile home ... and so\nThose that were destroyed by the hurricane they cannot replace them with a mobile home what's that's really in my opinion a good idea\nIt is now what about the another question what about the waters that allows owners just because it was the ... or so on church so that's not but I Wonder if they were also okay for now and in this area you got to build on stilts or or something like that or\nOr you know most of those beaches it's within a certain amount of ... feet or I charge or whatever that shift dude I'm but I mean who could have predicted I mean you know they haven't had one hit the panhandle ... was it like since the fifties yeah so I mean it's just one of those things you just never know but again our thoughts and\nWell she don't nobody know you cannot famine never listens to the show [laughter] remember\nWhy you admit that list and all your cousins everything\nWell now my cousins do they call them from Kentucky in ... they they log in and all that stuff but ah but I remember Bobby she's due Angelina ...\nYeah that's why when she was she was good yeah it's a good at it\nShe call and like I said and said Hi Bobby hey Julie and hey did and then then she\nGot old and sitting on your eye out and then she ... I mean she could switch right by me turn that voice on him and make the statements and say this stuff really very well she's a great job anyway\nYes you're the one thing that bad bad and mad is when when she gave her opinion she gave it from a you know from her from a teenagers are from the kid's point to be like them in other words if we wanted to remind the house\nAnd everything looked good on our side but from a kid's point of view you know it might be a it might be trouble in the making you know 'cause they're they're going to be undone are they going to be interrupted about their regular lives\nAnd Bobby that's a good points records and she said you know she said the best thing you can do is go outside and stay busy [laughter]\nSo that's pretty good but ah I tell you a lot of changes but I just have a photo phone I just have no ideal\nOh yeah there's lots of come in and also they're talking about that that a TV mad that uh uh that flat screen TV they tell me a rose up into a box now instead of you know you're asking how do they carry it there's I I saw a boxer folds down into and you just carry it like a a\nYou know something about a three foot long box just\nTransforming or in a to B Boy you're carrying somewhere\nAlong the ... the last ... I won't want to\nBe delivered to my house Bobby Yeah now how how does it away Bobby have you seen the ... uh the measurement oh it's ...\nHalf or something like this very light yeah boxers heavier than it is right exactly yeah for shipping purposes and to be cheap [laughter]\nWell we talked about projection TVs you know the projector type thing and I I have friends of ours that man during the summer sometimes when it gets like this or maybe last week when you get a little ... where in the air but you get in a [noise]\nAnd they take one of those big screen and it's a nip it in the air ...

maybe I'll look it up yeah I'll look that up for it I did okay it's a high number one\nWe talk about Bobby I repair or replace your roof now I don't think you want to do it but I mean uh the drones

bit about their background and uh\nYou're a family history in the silver mining industry and how you got interested in um a wellness aspects of sore [noise]\n... oh well about forty years ago my uh\nMy father and a number of other individual bomb found that number of silver mine\nAnd my family's card produced and silver way back then\nThan what happened was the price of silver dropped so low we couldn't telling a profit and to what happened was that\nMy father said you know we need to do something much better with the help we need to look at what product we can make that would do good for often also help he\nSaid there's more than eighty products better at clear products that are all based on building and uh well we ... we turned it into a huge study all silver had the cat\nAnd why we found was that there were a lot of products that were made a Bill Burton and most of the more I ...\nAnd ... the eye on it formed has been we're we're not very stable and we actually went on a crusade that they couldn't make an eye on it for months silver stable\nAnd what happened over time was bad\nI'm through our study and through all of our experimentation we thought that we had created a an eye for the silver that was very people that could be used in a lot of ...\nWe found out later with that we'd actually be the new nanoparticle silver bad multiple ... incredibly table it needs to be the ad in the other products\nAnd we were able to patent it formed the turnover because they had never been done before and now I think it could say their bike\nOr by luck and we think it's more of the ...\nWere able to create a new form of silver that was the nanoparticle covered with a very special ... code even with the most ... both by balance over I said counting on a nanoparticle\nLet's so interesting in the history of silver and then wanting to to look at a minimum of course when you have a product and you're trying to find all the different uses for that all types of technology\nComputers all types of electronics there's all types of needs for silver and industry but when it comes to health care um we can reflect on history even the Egyptian over two thousand years ago\nHad silver applications and then the old saying being born with a silver spoon in your mouth had a\nRecognition as a silver has some sort of therapy or anti bacterial\nSilver that's still so today is based on some of these very ancient technologies are very very expired patent power and so you came across a in in your research that there were some side effects if you will a and some inefficiencies of silver\nOr that had been around for centuries and he wanted to find kind of a better mouse trap if you will\nThat was very very safe could be used on an indefinite basis with no toxicity and with all of a science and all the documentation and resources and you had in your family you came up with something and you've got to patent it because of its uniqueness [noise]\nUh and I have seen so many people with so many situations a benefit from the silver and I was so excited that we were able to schedule an interview with you today [noise]\nTell you what it's a it's an amazing thing when you find was silver can actually do\nAnd uh when I Dream about all the products that you could make I mean we filed new ... new product\nA new product that would be a boon wash\nAnd a pain reliever at the same time\nWeek well nine months or that we we had another new at\nA group or a organically is could we could have somebody pulled the we're in the earlier that silver jail or is there

Know quite a bit about that but [laughter] and uh it's you know\nLet's just refresh some of the the the kind of the the mistakes of the buying public to make when they just go into anywhere that might look like a health food store\nDrug store and say I heard something about silver liquid or colloidal and I want to get a bottle what were the buyer needed to know about the making of a purchase [noise]\nWell the real big deal is that most companies really have no work on the product\nYou don't know what you're getting an anything boy this silver and water and that is down ... silver\nAnd some are like thousands ... parts per million some can be like two hundred fifty million so you understand the different let me let me give you the one on one on it okay they're basically three forms of silver that are on the market one is called ...\nI Am a forms of his tumor once they are is the single silver ion Adam\nAnd they're missing that electrons and they want to back\nOnce they get out of the electron they're happy so there are no more use like a single shot\nAnd so I on a farm to the beginning to think about things they'll show they were but they don't work very well\nNow I Am it forms a silver not very stable and so once they do is they find it to protein to keep it in his first pension meaning keep it from falling out into the bottom of a bottle\nAnd so some companies find it to ... ... ... your grandma make jello or gel at an right\nOr jam they put a protein in there which keep all the\nAh [noise] keeps all love the Jews as an day and keeps turning combat boom that's kind of what they do and it's called the silver protein and you'll be able to found those pretty easy because the scope of proteins there about\nTwo hundred and fifty five hundred parts per million and they pay their better because they have more silver plus the answer is they're not actually better because of protein ... of their ability to function\nAnd so what you have the only partially functional things chat and because of that they put a huge amount as silver in there like two hundred and fifty to five hundred million\nOut those are both on a form as a single shot it will work but it just doesn't work that wow\nBut we create that like I said by accident ... gift was the nanoparticle and this particle is covered with the skin on the outside is the most balance of rock that ... what's that mean has that and that is the only one electron ours to eight\nAnd then it pose those into the core and they can feel a more and then eight more and then a more to what happened is Glen Bell slugging machine gun where everybody has the English that\nNot only that you have to take into consideration the state by now Miami farms there's been a very stiff\nYour body because their chemicals on ... happens is they can actually say in your body to months weeks or months\nUm banana silver that we use goes and does the chopping washers right out in fact we have the only human ingestion Sundays the history of the world and why we proved foods that are now and I'm Still bridge eastern ... will walk out of your body completely twenty four hours\nAnd that's what you want you wanted to go in to his job the band wash right out and ... or so we also proved that ours was the crowd is really more of the fact that didn't know he talked a little earlier about a product called the deep\nEverything is the number one burned cream in ... on the market as white creamy stopping\nIt has like ten thousand parts per million silver\nAnd we decided that we would make a prescription products that people could use that would be a lot safer a lot more effective and you know better but in order to get the SBA Clarence on that we had to go head to head with that with a drug products that are already ... and we ...\nWe did was we took thirty two parts per million of our ...\nPills or jail and we put it up again ten thousand parts per million of the a bill that interesting thing that happened was that back in the past we pick that now is bacteria and hospital is called ... telling resistant bath far yet\nTo hear that path and facts and the bad stuff that that is called Bertha\nAnyway we had that passed we kinda nobody could kill that ... but it took more than five hours to do it\nAnd we have there are product and we found that thirty two PM weaken people at all in less than thirty minutes\nWe're ten times faster and killing the bacteria and then the pharmaceutical product they had three hundred times more the active ingredient hey we're a lot for a lot faster and a lot more Christian that killing the bacteria in protecting the boot\nAnd besides the fact that it is in Greece and climbed me like math but yet they're still in jail try to\nSet out that ah that's a cool thing to be able to do that much lower level a much more effectively and the Mets they used for being in that you have really no negative aspect that prescription product I think is the only prescription product tier United States\nBad bacteria pathogenic bacteria have one or two spending all layers around the outside one or two and their soluble meaning water and stuff will pull into the part of color into the bacteria when we found is that your good bacteria that the steps you get from yogurt and all that other stuff\nUm it has breached the wall and it stops soluble and the silver has just now in fact at least up to that ... million lab fell by ... to kill the bad stuff but not that good stuff are really becomes more of a miracle\nAnd the fact is we have this study is to back it was not a question you can argue as to why you can't argue the fact that we don't do it because we had three different studies which brings me don't kill the good stuff\nInteresting stuff too is that we were doing\nA a it was one of my son's preschool science project\nAnd he took milk and they put it out on the counter\nAnd he took unprotected ... put it out many two males count and they started some silver and doesn't milk about two weeks later there's science fair project one of them started just think that ... didn't have any silver and then turn this thing\nAll the milk fat stuff it's gone to the bottom was downloading it was horrible\nThe other one blood perfect I find it still looks like a glass of milk\nSo I took the glass ... and it cracked I thought oh my gosh we made yogurt like killing the bad bacteria but not the good bacteria in the mail never went back\nIt just started growing the probiotic or good bacteria isn't actually end up being yogurt and about two weeks\nFascinating it's um it's we're learning so much today about all the benefits of silver and just the amazing aspects of\nA very scientifically advanced uh technically advanced forms of silver and all types of products and we're going to cover those products after the upcoming break about all the different ways to use the silver so to drink and lotions uh but the technology I Can't stress

traveled all over and I've been to I'm guessing conservatively five hundred different conferences and it's probably many more than that and many of these conferences I'm One of many people on an agenda where I'm a speaker versus wearing leading a seminar\nAnd I look at the agenda and I kind of follow the trends of what what is popular in the speaker market what's popular in the corporate event market who are the speakers that are out there and through my time in particularly post nine eleven\nThe military speakers have always been well received\nThere's a group of people out there right now who all have a similar background in that they were air force or navy pilots fighter pilots and they travel the country giving presentations using a lot of\nA ... a lot of sound a lot of pictures of of jet aircraft and it's true it nearly intoxicating the adrenaline just pumps watching this stuff\nAnd they talk about the mission and the need to bring the team aboard and now this relates to business there seems to be a Navy SEAL around every corner in the speaker market these days talking in about the mission and the need for the team and developing and planning and rehearsing you fall back on your training and things like this they're out there everywhere\nBut and I could be wrong here are wide open to being wrong there aren't a whole lot of these military people that have transferred easily in remarkably successfully into the business world it seems to me\nThat a lot of their military background as I won't say well as programmed them and it's hard to break that training so that when they get into the business world they seem to struggle there's an exception and I'm going to interview our section back from the break\nHis name is Brad Israel bread Israel joined the army in two thousand five he earned his commission to the officer candidate school as an infantry officer\nHe's graduated from ranger an airborne schools let an airborne rifle platoon heavy weapons platoon\nA scout reconnaissance platoon all in combat in eastern Afghanistan he earned a bronze star in for back to your to bronze stars and an army combination metal with a V. device for valor in battle\nIn February of twenty eleven bread earned the title of Green Beret suffice to say this guy has seen a background that most of us have no idea exists\nBut my question is this when you're training in the military the goal of being in the military certainly in combat\nIs to eliminate\nThe competition not to meet the competition not to win the sale\nTo earn the contract not to go out in a position yourself not the brand yourself in front of the competition [noise] it's to eliminate the competition\nAnd the question is can somebody with this background transfer into the workforce easily and what is it that they need to know and what can they teach the workforce but we're going to hear from Brad Israel when we come back\nIf I have a relationship with them they can look at me and say hey I Know that we want to have this done by the end acute three and a were five days away from that that line and I'm probably gonna be Ninety five percent there but I'm not going to have a hundred percent complete I'll have to you at first week into cue for\nA much happier than that with getting some incomplete work or getting something that's polar bears\nAnd they know that what they're going to get from us as the same thing because we're all going to screw up I've screwed up probably a dozen times already today and as long as I Am\nAt the purest of intent and everybody knows that I'm trying as hard as I can to help the company and help our organization\nAnd they are going to extend that grace that I'm an extended them to let me on and here's why we drive our business plans and that's where we're hitting that every week looking at our school records as departments so that there's complete transparency with what we have to get done in order to keep the doors open so that we can continue to take care of those employees as well as their families\nIs theory consequences in the military for not hitting goals does it fall on you in some way if you've got

accountability to your hires up when you can get your support and it's to do what they're supposed to do\nI wasn't aware that does exist in the military I thought I was just the the major in your title you can just tell people what to do and they have to do it\nBut there are challenges tell us more about that accountability and how it relates how it's helped you relate to the business world\n... so what we're talking about is really you know when you have folks that that either aren't able to execute on whatever the goals and all of that military unit or um or even in even in the private sector in our context\nWhat we first look at is is one are they willing but they have the attitude and behaviors to be able to adapt to what the job requires and do they have the skill sets because that's almost a prerequisite out the door have we done everything possible to train them\nTo make sure that they have that\nResources have they been constrained by as it did we bump up a deadline to remove the goal line one of those things that that may have played a factor because I I I'll be honest I even had a few folks that were there were young noncommissioned officers that were good people in the military\nAnd then see they were not able to do we needed to do in order to achieve the standards that we had set for so I still want to take care of that individual but they're probably gonna be asked to go be awesome somewhere else in a different role probably not on articles and maybe in the higher headquarters what's that\nGo on go be awesome somewhere else\nThat's what I said in the military that was a car and we used to use and it was you know they may not have a role here but we do believe that there is a place for them and maybe it's\nServing in and one of our um our support battalions maybe it's serving at the battalion headquarters or to help the operation sell whatever it may be there there was something they could do because they were not\nThey they didn't have any kind of defiance characteristics where they just didn't want to respect the chain of command they had just probably reach their capacity at that time and because of how fast we're moving with our operational tempo sometimes we had to replace those good people with others that were capable and qualified that could come in\nAnd take us to the next level and you look at that with in the private sector you look at some organizations that were really really fast\nAnd they end up out growing some of the folks that are in leadership results and so you can kind of take a a moment to pause and say where can we go get this individual additional training so that they can\nReally be able to lead their team effectively um or maybe we need to look at bringing somebody else and that has got that experience that can help train and mentor this individual and put them in a position higher that's commensurate with the growth of that organization\nYou've sent in advance the three sixty framework and I'm going to pose this along with this ah the pod cast put it on the Facebook page on people to see this tell me first where this comes from and secondly how you do it and then let's talk about awareness\nSure so when three sixty framework was that starts with the silkworm is like you said and so part of this came from insights discovery which you've probably heard of and it's a self awareness personality assessment like many of them out there but it's the one that spoke to us the most which we found the most relevant\nInside our organizations and that was brought to us by\nUm leadership in business to shut up for genuine named mark Fernandez who was a a license practitioner\nAnd then since I went and became a license practitioner there so that we could administer those assessments on do\nWorkshops inside um our company or new hires as well as kind of re training opportunities as teams and apartments were growing up when we look at a three sixty frame or\nOne of the most important things as a leader to understand is that self awareness\nAnd that's who and how you are as it says right there on that slot and so we use the insides because it's going to give you just to the face value validity chest of intentional use you show up toward who you want the world to perceive us and\nWe start there because when you when you have a team you got a diversity of the minds you might you might not have you know one thing specifically that distinguishes from another organization but I Would make the argument that\nAll the different personality types if you put them on the wheel which is something that inside she does and you look at where people fall on this way all which is really just an identifier where you fall\nIn where your your highest interviewed colors are\nThen you start to understand what you're off the types are you start to understand ways to effectively communicate in ways not to you'd recognize your blind spots and and we're\nAnd we put it up outside all our all the stores so that if I'm walking into ... office and I see his colors or energy callers I quickly can associate with that type of behavior that I'm a expect out of K on when I go to interact with them just like he will do the same for me\nDon't wouldn't we become when we become aware of ourselves doesn't that immediately change our our factors are going to so it's kind of maybe a theoretical question but uh\nCall me taste to five one sick for seven oh two four\nFive on line at first protective dot com\n\n\nBust and you're listening to what's working with me as brand Israel in something that he has done that I'm betting most of us it was not\nSpend time in combat in eastern Afghanistan in the mountains brands resume is remarkable an extraordinary military background he went to officer candidate school he's a Green Beret he's won the bronze star brand did I see twice is that right that is correct second bronze star a majority of service medal for leadership in the seventh special\nForces group brand can combat in any way be similar to business\nI think you can I think you've got to really look at what you're thinking about when you want to make that a parallel but you know and and obviously taking a few steps back when you're not necessarily talking life or death although there are roles in the business world and the health care and\nNow I'm gonna I'm gonna run with that one because something that comes to mind is you know we used to have a signing combat complacency kills\nAnd the enemy when we're living in the side of a mountain or in a village in Kandahar Paktika in eastern Afghanistan\nThe enemy is not wearing a uniform\nSo there are there in the city of people that you're trying to build relationships with and you don't know what they're doing to uh observed detect um establish patterns of\nWe're all creatures of habit so where we walk anywhere we vulnerable where can they hit us how can they hit us what are they going to do to get away from us all those things where you have to be hyper aware of\nWhen we're over there and we got folks that are that are looking at the dinner almost like a linebacker with his head on us level trying to identify who are are threats who's a friend who's the ... and ... and collect on us just as we're trying to alienate isolate the enemy by\nBuilding those relationships and so an example I can give you as we uh we had a very\nInteresting relationship with the bomb maker that was from a village where we were living and\nHe had he really recognized how well we were doing with winning that village over and so she made it his personal mission to really hone in on us and started I'm putting daisy chain where they where they buried different improvised explosive devices in the ground\nAnd putting them out where he could use a remote control demise such as a phone or garage door opener to try to insulate mass casualties on owned by men and on when we were out doing this mounted patrols from village to village to go engage the locals\nAnd my guys we're we're so incredible camp they could pick up on things that were just out of place which Ninety nine point nine percent of bothers would never realize like when a rocket been or when it looked like somebody had just been there yet we hadn't seen anyone and so\nThis one day they they they recognize that we end up pulling six little coffee can um ... sized bombs out of the ground after we had gotten to the high ground and we'd obviously run he and his cronies all\nWe bulldoze out and we taught a class to the locals on how complacency kills them what they need to be recognized and if they're going to be taken out our ship the village\nAnd he also did it with a a donkey he put rockets in the back of the burlap sack on a donkey in state to to the ground\nAnd tried to blow us up that way and and I share the stories with you because you know we had to focus on that every day we had checklist and we we had accountability measures in place with our inspections with communicating with recognizing where one of us may be going in and why\nOr how I was going to kill him I was the enemy and so it always was in conversation it's what we talked about and when you think about the business parallel there if if we're not if we think that we're we're high on the hog and and we're really doing well and\nEverything's working and we're not constantly looking ... mindset of how we're going to prove than the competition is going to pass us and the only person we can be mad at as ourselves because we settled for where we work and we did not\nTrying to think unconventional ... what's the next thing we can be doing to continue to make sure that we're master never relationship I'm astronaut product hospital example it was just like when they started introducing check listen to the hospital and giving everybody a voice when they were in the operating room it wasn't just a surgeon to speak up if they saw something going wrong\nThose are the ways that you counter that complacency in the workforce is by giving everybody a voice in power and then with absolute clarity and then making sure you're always thinking from that growth mindset of there's a better way we got to always be watching this I don't want to be out competed by the competition and I think about a mindset that's what's going to distinguish may from everyone else\nAbout you went into these villages you had to make friends you had to become a a an ally\nIsn't that right or sense in which he did but you came in made an impression and just like you said that you began to gain hand way with the villagers and one of the people ... is a threat and try to attack you for that\nIs there a parallel into going into a new team or a new company for example is a consultant into a company\nWhat was the process of becoming allies with the natives and is there are ... are these steps that you would repeat let's say if you were to go into another company as a consultant we're developing a relationship where you've been hired to buy a new company and you're stepping in for the first time and you want to show the quote unquote villagers\nYou're trustworthy you're with them that you understand them what was that processing you relate that to any a workplace environment\nSays the process over there was\nYou know we we it almost fell on our wraps just because we were so frustrated when we moved into this one village where to recover probably twenty plus twenty five plus improvised explosive devices on one day and then multiple or\nJust to get there and we figured when we arrived that we would be heroes but because we had just opened up the lines of\nOf of trade and communication back to Kandahar city and when we got there nobody wanted to talk to us and so we were dejected we're getting rocketed getting shot at sleeping on the side of a mountain\nAnd snowstorms for or weeks until we finally started to build some report the locals and we started that because I had for interpreters there were gainfully unemployed because nobody would speak with us none of the owners would or ... ... talk so we started teaching\nThe kids and we started listening and learning more about our village we knew a lot about their culture because most of us had been there before and we had we studied it\nBut as we started truly dissect that specific village we had stories that we could relate to that we could share with them\nAnd then we were able to pinpoint some of the fathers of those children that we were teaching drawing ... arithmetic in Pashtun and and how to ride out their letters and and we went and we went and met down at night and I asked if they would let us come in and talk to them and it's so it's really it starts with kind of taken him and tore\nNo preparation to the battlefield is is one of the things that we do and just just understanding your environment\nAnd that's what I Would say is is what would work as well going into the organization is is get to know\nThat people get to understand what's going on what's working what's not working why isn't working once you know what what are the relationships inside these teams like\nAnd and then just being consistent every day and showing up and shown that you care and by doing that you're going to build that trust but it's so necessary to be able to move any organization and so I think the number one\nDysfunction about any team it matter if it's in the military or in the private sector or our civilian context it all is is\nIs a lack of trust and so that's what we did with the locals and at work because we endeared ourselves to them by building relationships with their children and teaching them and investing in I'm In the same thing can be said for your ... invest\nIn your team's invest in your leaders starts setting the conditions of the next generation either internally and organically or those that you aspire to to bring in from another organization\nStart investing in those relationships so that you can watch them grow and flourish and they will always always and you will that connection and deeply indebted because of what you did for them and out\nIf you don't want him to cheat extraordinary things that we were part of that and I I Would hope that they would say the same thing for us\nAnd we'll be the first ones and Nathan toxins one of my best friends and the CEO and founder of sixty adventurous at the same thing if somebody wants to leave I Will give him a hug and tell them how much we appreciate them do everything we can to help them go out and be successful\nWhat surprised you the most spread about coming out of a military into the business world would call you off guard\nIt was just it was the lack of trust you know when you when you go to ranger school or you go to any of these courses I don't know you from Adam and immediately I get thrown into a leadership position in my a valuation might go if you will depends on you\nOrders from me not knowing me at all being able to do your job to help the team when and if that's on a raid or if that's on a reconnaissance mission or movement to contact whatever it is not in that environment I've got to put all my bike on trust in you and then over time because\nWe'll have another show for you next week everybody thanks for listening to

guy that we can't from from a sensor dating a very prominent are critical journalists but\nYou know the pieces are beginning to add up to the fact that he was murdered nobody has seen him leave the embassy or to get in the embassy as well monitored by a Turkish air security cameras so I think the evidence and it's up to guess says something pretty happened to a democracy hokey\nLet me let me go back to something that she says oh the employees will do to David a oh and then there's this group of um I did a says soon go in and they were acting like the embassy in boys\nWell the embassy

about basically meeting up with this guy and that could have been just code for what they're doing how does the U.S has handled this I mean there's this seems I mean you have a Washington Post joined gr\nReporter he actually resigned his home and then it said how do you um how do you think is when something like this\nWell the president has said he's going to speak to Saudi Arabia about this uh I presume you will to put the United States Senate if a quandary because turkey is a\nIs a very unhappy about there is to turkey and Saudi Arabia had difficult relations anyway and then suddenly makes it seem wars that\nUh that show that he had a had gone destined bold ears are buried ... papers pretty buried chitter certificate\nOn and so what happens I'm Turkish soil a a team if it was there at arrives and apparently carries out\nA possible murder or even in Turkey although technically Saudi territory and the cons alight but nevertheless there's been racing or to to turkey which offered\nA turkey sent a certain amount of freedom which is unusual for journalists in Turkey\nUm turkey is a NATO ally or Saudi Arabia has established a particular Frank trip with the crop administration a

span of his control over the country\nThat ... that he's going to say to a relationship with the Trump wouldn't do anything\nThat the suspicion and that's what the Washington Post has a has a chance that in some ways a President Trump may have empowered or the or the royal family that are there he's ... and they won't do anything\nI think the reality is that it it really doesn't matter who the president is Saudi Arabia is not going to uh let anybody interfere in what they regard as a an internal matter even though it happened ... other countries so\nI suspect that even to President Trump put pressure on on the on the ... family and say you're kind of come clean on managed to tell us when it happened ah I got pretty much that they would again this is one of the most secretive countries

the ... of these people in terms of the organization that I've seen their skin names or I don't recognize them as being a part of their ... kernels security um systems in Saudi Arabia the national

they worked for the crown prince and ... and the family you know I guess you could argue or everybody in Saudi Arabia\nOr worked for the royal family because it is dirty rape you but\nMy sense is that this is probably a very small released secretive group that Saddam is based in in Riyadh and a bit there's on the workers the or the crown prince\nWe have a big orange to waste time with him last year they seem to be in jeopardy\nNo I think that there is so much support\nOr their arms deal down at a I think it did it did is almost bullet proof\nOne interesting ... firearms is the thing of orange something Tom how Americans buy arms I didn't learn something about uh how Israelis by our\nPicture to the contractors pointed out to our country so the beneficiaries of the Saudi Arabian arms dealer on dealer in Arizona or during the winter there in California in just enough electoral districts so that there's plenty of political support for this\nUh the view that Saudi Arabia has done over the past five years ... over a hundred billion dollars and there are some pretty fancy things um again give a lot of jobs to ah to American so I think that even the of\nSaudi Arabia to say yeah we killed him already going to do about it uh I don't think that the arms deal would really be in jeopardy there's just way too much political support toward\nInspirational in theaters like Syria\nI'm sure particularly when they they ate leaked out that the intelligence community had an intercepted here at St ... they're going to keep it real close to them\nI just feel like half the time even if you go to like your best sources were not getting the full story what's happening in the middle East that you've been just been installed some big conspiracy it's there's too many players and too much happening\nSo quickly and done and uh the secretive away it's not official actions by nations it's a lot of these special operations and there's a lot of jockeying for position [noise]\nKind of scary yeah the Trump and a bad situation to tell you that I'm going to curb dissenting those kind of unusual talking about the candidate\nThey Kevin uh allegations here there's such an end to this\nThe way my barnacles allegations against the Supreme Court nominee that\n[noise] ah five ten years ago most likely would not have made ... ah unsubstantiated allegations on one side\nAnd then on the other side and I'm Talking about the stories that followed Dr brown story which would have been much stronger fed her doctor story it would've been much stronger Dr Ford story would have stood alone instead of\n... and claims that followed a stream of them but also on the other side Mike let me ask you what New York times reporter Washington Post reporter was assigned a story by their editors to go see what really happened when Dianne Feinstein an\nIn fines died and her staff said because it's sort of questions that would have\nIf the Republican Party has done the same thing about one and I and I challenge the New York times reporters this morning about reporters editors I challenge the Washington Post editors I challenged Wall Street journal editors I challenge editors across America ...\nStory for what happens when Dr foreign agreement or\nWhen Dianne Feinstein white is a link fence story and more importantly look at yourself and ask yourself the question why we report on this in real time when I'm sure as hell would have reported on it it Grassley\nAnd his office had done the same thing\nThere and he's absolutely right and yeah I don't agree with you as her very often but he uh he told them out and that was a good thing to do can you pull that clip budget sent you a chance to take one second here you take your time\n\nToday ... ... was was spying on with this thing and it's\nA ... sometimes ... ... people above you or something I Can't be such over for the Democrats in the immigrants do look bad here I Wonder if it was time Feinstein herself for some of their all says what they did and how they handled it was thinking political first\nInstead of actually following the facts of the case they're looking to score points and it does a disservice to the larger cultural moment we're having with\nA sexual assault an awareness because instead of really treating this as cans of victim and incredible to me balls they forward\nOh they made her tone and the big political good well do you did a disservice to her a machine is true that was the the totally believable which he went through and said how painful it was and and everything to be doing it and put in a puppet and it was certainly avoidable totally aboard the ...\nThere was actually a a house of cards episode I Can't remember which season we're color of the ... river president Underwood wife said you in person at a time trying to get somebody to come and speak to Congress who's a a victim of sexual assault in shape at the last second says no I'm not going in front of the committee\nAnd like color threatens urged tries to do a storm and it it's weird how out of the fictional stories that are a little exaggerated\nYou still see these real life saying some people get chewed up in the system\nWhere they have real real feelings real stories are real people and yet we're still playing politics at the end of the day\nCame we pick up this clip I just think it was centered opponent winning to stop and go here or he's going to turn out to asking are being asked about the ... the journalists that was allegedly murdered and dismembered in a high salary ...\nBrand new video just released what Turkish media are calling and assassination squad Fifteen member group believed to be linked to the murder of us journalists mall cause show gay\nClub concern anytime that ... and ... and Stan ball where last more than a week ago\nOur next guest says hell now force a vote in the Senate this week blocking us arms sales to Saudi Arabia Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and joins us now they're killing our journalist I think it's only write the president has got Korea relations with the Saudis should he be more aggressive\n[noise] oh yeah I've been calling for some time because for over\nA couple of years now we've been supporting the Saudi prince bombing in Yemen\nOver ten thousand civilians have died but now that the Saudis here to be involved with the killing of a journalist I think we shouldn't be selling them weapons we shouldn't be aiding and abetting what they're doing in Yemen\nAnd uh yeah signal needs to be sad I mean if we send signals to other countries that misbehave certainly we should send signals to an ally that this is unacceptable\nOr one of the people on our team who send signals to other nations is

some other reason behind it all and she's done a pretty good job the ministry should hasn't she [noise] you know I think what we need to think about is who the president should pick and I think the president should pick somebody who agrees with presidents version of the Iraq\nWas a mistake that the Afghan war is coming to a close that there is no military solution in Afghanistan so I really want somebody to come forward to the president will think that actually agrees with the president's vision for foreign policy and that\nThat's a good question but ah I think that to many of the people surrounding him given the advice that we must stay forever in Afghanistan they are now saying we must stay forever in Syria they're saying we must stay forever and Africa\nThat we know stay forever

good answer to your show respected and\nHe's doing is an incredible\nAre talking about this and I have to tell you that important meetings and they were senators with everything nobody cares they want to just really was the main thing is that right sooner than those I'm going to a break any bitterness coming back\nTo new life after that\nAnd more a show\n\nRent Rosenstein say no you get\nAnd who's Rod Rosenstein is principal accuser anti McCain and one is Andy being investigated for lying right so this is hardly the person that you want to hold up as a as a principle accuser to dislodge or otherwise interfere with the person who was known in fact running the day I work for the FBI correct\nSounds a lot of stuff as is tangled\nLike this I think at Rosenstein is doing the right thing by taking a step back even though I agree with the motivation of a lot of they were probably changed it sounds like he was willing to come if it was an informal meeting all kind of off the record not sworn testimony by when it became clear the Republicans wanted him\nTo be under oath isn't you know what we're having a schedule problem right\nWell they don't want to go under listen they are co equal branch of government he can resist them they have been subpoenaed him they have to worry about a perjury trap I\nI I don't know what he's worried about except that he's probably doesn't want the transcripts out there and you know they'll get out [noise]\nAnd that's exactly what the problem is that why was this an doesn't want to do it is that the ... summit lake in it can kind of blow something that's bigger than we known but it was every time that was in the sun ... on Trump is a lot of confidence in him\nAnd they do not a battle and I either Rosa says liners burn up where he's telling the truth and he's very believable to a deterrent to let me go into a part of the Trump interview\nAnd where he's talking about a Rosenstein the newness is cutting number for where we just let me stop and go here folks this is Trump this morning a box you\nTraveled to an air force one\nApparently a forty five minute conversation with him I think we're going down to Orlando for the police chase a conference apparently a number of Republican congressmen and wanted to have him on on Capitol Hill today\nThey wanted him to be under oath or and he was reluctant to do that reportedly he would have preferred an informal meeting with perhaps just one or two members not a whole hearing but\nApparently you know we just had going on and he said that he probably didn't want to show up because they didn't want to be under oath [laughter] you know the rumor is the day after the midterms are going to fire him and you're going to fire the attorney general [noise] well\nI actually get along well with the ... that we have a witch hunt going on which is disgraceful and I have to tell you I'll take these Republican guys who was Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan and engaged in game ... and all of\nI I hate to mention a few names because there's so many of them and I want to give every one of them rather these are tough\nSmart guys said you know there was no collusion it turned out with Russia there was collusion but it was Hillary Clinton but at the end see I mean why as an example you had to take the DNC server and didn't take it\nWhere there's\nSo many questions but I'll say these Republican I think they're becoming a folk heroes user degraded graded the ball and they want to get to the bottom of it and you know when you\nGet hurt Mr President the people in your administrator and Rod Rosenstein will not show up on Capitol Hill to come in since ... Congress that\nActually I was surprised that I Would think he would uh he mentioned certain things to me that you know a car very positive about that event and I would imagine that you'd want to put that down and frankly whether you were under oath or not shouldn't matter\nBut he mentioned things to me that I Would think would be fine for him to testify in ... when Congress call so I Would I'm a little surprised that rod\nDo it to have a good relationship with Iran 'cause we work with a lot of other thing\nI heard your bonding by one thing you're pissed trust because Andy McCabe and you believe that ended with the bad\nGuy hadn't called me is it man I don't forget these are very bad guy is kind of got very lucky one I fired him\nAnd I you know rod wrote a big a memo about how horrible they read the memo how horrible calling me isn't he was a horrible guy and he lied in the least\nHe lied before Congress but he was leaking all over the place and not only ruins professor professor friend who took this stuff at least whenever you want them to do so call me it was a bad guy\nBut became a very bad\nBut he works recovery remember one thing about\nHis wife was running for office and he had seven hundred\nAnd fifty thousand dollars from Hillary Clinton said essentially pack it was run by Terry McAuliffe who is absolutely Hillary Clinton was absolutely Hillary Clinton's best friend and Bill Clinton but they gave me seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars for his wife nobody even knows if she spent the money\nHe might not have spent the money and this was at the time that she was being investigated\nBy McCain because suddenly came and is investigating Hillary Clinton and her pack\nEssentially by her best friend is paying became seven\nHundred and fifty thousand dollars to me that's a big deal and nobody ever mentions that is really a and you know we've got a horn incidents I think I've done a great service to this country 'cause I suppose so much when you look at the emails between the two lovers dropped\nAt least a page and you say the insurance policy where they're still wanting to win against Trump but then in a moment of silence they said well is that doesn't work out [noise]\nWe have an insurance policy while the insurance\nFairly long period of time there was tremendous corruption and\nI'll tell you what these people want to get to the bottom of it and I don't think people like never known as you you should get\nThis alternative like everyone thinks it will seven in order to get the medal of honor is really what he's gone through and his bravery and get a very important in\nA metal label called medal of freedom because we actually given high or just for civilians and he's he's done an amazing you know it's like no matter what isn't and and all ... all of these people let's say what they go through\nAnd they're right and they can't understand why they're being stymied at so many different levels but now it's coming out and it's really sad I did a great service for this country\nWhen I fired me he was a bad guy with a bad intentions\nAnd you look at the way he handled and the one thing just to finish up in that you know the Democrats hated calling me more than any human being he actually did Hillary Clinton favorite 'cause she shouldn't be in jail but as soon as they should have to take it or right off the campaign buddy just so we did or a big fire but\nBut the Democrats hated call me hated him and I said the one thing is what I fired him I said I was going to get bipartisan support and you look at humor and all those people they put out a horrible statements about comedy should be fired carries a disgrace the minute\nHe was fired they came out said he was a wonderful and I said I Can't believe it I Can't believe they said\nAfter he was hired it was like from a different planet so you know a lot of politicians what can I tell you I'm\nGlad you brought up firing the kinds of your wife recently had an interview and she said there are\nPeople ... to sorry I missed the cut that out I did the wrong one there because did you notice how he was asked a question about Rosenstein and he said I'm surprised that he did and\nThen he turned it immediately to Khomeini and then he was also known by McKay yes and so ... and ... and exactly then it was and so he went back to what I Believe he was telling him an inspector general's report yes and investigation\nAnd I think that's why he did it that way so in other words you em em I'm going to surprise he did but then to do with the economy in and basically that gee do you think that's what's going\nOn because it again I go back to I think Rosenstein it probably is that I Jay report or words as doing it again folks the first thing ... was only the Hillary Clinton email investigation look ... view is that going the FBI\nWhat Horowitz is now working on what the inspector general is now working on is the beginning of the Russia probe this isn't the bowler investigation this is while the campaign still going on the election is yet to happen\nAnd struck opens up the Russia investigation on Trump\nAdult Carter Page and the size of war and that's what Michael Moore what's the idea of looking at\nAnd it will be all these players as my family that's probably what Rosenstein knows about and he doesn't want to have to say no comment that Congress or say something that will ... people off because Congress is links like a ...\nBecause then it says that they I mean you're talking about taking the deputy ... you may be talking about\nTaking the former director out because he went to he went to me is a bad player pretty fast and the nation should thank me for that\nHe did it pretty fast and so I think the McKay Blake ... McCabe is saying particularly this just in the Washington Post between Rosenstein and became today which is you know you can usually I usually do but they're going to serve and who's to blame and that uh\nAnd if he goes in and says no it didn't it was certainly made up and here's the evidence that they don't even know it gives the evidence habit then you kind of blown which were they going on here

I mean it was I can tell you it 'cause it's I bought it off of Amazon I think when we look\nOkay Hi there this is fun [laughter] oh as drops yeah yeah my case a horizon zero Don resin evil seven um all that or should be low in price\nAnd like you say wait till Black Friday sea of something else a\nFifth price drops a little more\nThat oh the gold edition right now is thirty bucks\nOn ... ... ...\nYeah it's thirty dollars right now for the gold addition um\nWell my drop a little more Black Friday if it doesn't it's not like it's going to the price going to go up\nSo when I'm waiting for its loading details for the things I Want to say\nYou go back to my orders [noise]\nSearch all orders ... and ...\nTo do that tribe is one of the times I should have waited on like a needle out if I picked it up December fourteenth\nAnd it was a price in Europe between said\nI can tell you what it is here and just a second look but that call on hold real quick [noise] um\nI can tell you what that was does it give me the order details\nOr details there and as\nI bought it for twenty dollars\nWhile Twenty one fifty nine after tax ... for price their nose in December that was in December [noise] have I played it no [laughter] it's a horrible at that man\nAnd I'm near Marable same here by game ... by the time he played the prices like Robert Malley is it's a okay I'm a carts on the line here no okay\nAnd if you could um but yeah we're coming up on a on a break here I'm Still looking through the uh [noise] yeah let's see there is a a there's a flash sale on the PlayStation Store\nGoing on right now by the way a missed it\nUp into a well no it's still going on but I missed the opening of it I don't recall the other way [noise] oh really yeah I was on\nThere's a splinter cell sale\nGoing steam that's a little tough to say some of splinter cell fail early on in this thing they'll splinter cell yeah there you go exactly God or collectors edition it's a hundred and nine bucks\nAre many games it's the statue edition felt that I was talking to okay yeah yeah it's the big statue edition and I think\nRetail that was like one fifty so you know fifty bucks off\nOf that not bad at all [noise]\nSo [noise] I'm\nAll right well we're going to take a break here and when we come back we will talk to Kurt a balance and he'll tell me what this thing is called again it's project something I Can't remember what it's called but Google is doing their thing\nAllowing you to do a play the game through their chrome browser and we're not talking about just any old game or just any kind of like some kind of flash game or something like that talking about legit games through your browser are currently they're testing it out with assassins greet odyssey but just just came out earlier this month\nAnd a Kurd has had it for a good while at least a week now and he's going to tell us a how it's working out with him and how it's going in and just you know more about it as well so he's on the line we're going to get to him when we come back\nOr going into the music I was able to get new songs for Halloween ... there's really no see mothers and it's all Halloween related to to make them all Halloween really related and then find a common thread\nThat isn't Halloween related was really tough so we didn't do that\nNot going to get that this month 'cause it's just it's a little tough coming up with scary music from games I'll tell you a couple of things about it number one a lot of scary games don't have music they let the atmosphere do the talking or the the the ... the the atmosphere be the music eerie ear he sounds and whatnot yeah or it's just real low\nYou know just low level noise type stuff that's just very\nSubtle and and just nothing that is put the occasional twinge during the jobs scarce off right right right I found one game and here the ... I mean it was a couple of there's a couple of you'll find out when we go through this one comes from the resident evil to remake\nSilly set on YouTube when I found that if this is just somebody put this together that's very possible because there wasn't able to remake I don't think it's out yet right I was going to be a minute for that comes up and so what what they have is the the music from the save room\nThe typewriter when you're doing the save room and stuff so this is apparently what that is a trolley yeah it's probably pulled from uh from from demo play or something I don't know I Can't I Can't really\nTrust the validity of I have no idea if it is going to that's what it says it is so that's where we're going to go with will be back with more of an game chat and a curse on the phone with is coming up next [noise]\n\n\nI'm an almost no low time is is downright amazing\nAbsolutely no low time on the okay or he by the way our Jay he's going to be in the back door I'm going to have been done a\n... just got here so [noise] um\nAnyway so there is there's no way to say could you say no low time\nIt it it it didn't work out because they know there was a very low for a little time so it's it's no different than say having a um M. dot to flash as to where your game is installed its just fast floating\nIn okay gotcha um how's the lag input lag\nYou know I haven't really noticed it and I played at both on a board and on my uh with an X. box one Bluetooth controller so that the the the regular ... modern X. box one controller that actually has a both Bluetooth and the X. box streaming political and I I I'll be honest I Can't tell the difference between\nPlaying it live on a console and playing it over the stream it really is quite animated pack\nWhat are you are you planning on your desktop machine\nI played it on a few machine so far so good waited on my my main desktop which is a standard para monitors ... right but then I have a ... I have a Lenovo Yoga\nAnd and I played on that and that's a that's a ... for case screen and it it up converts properly and it looks still damn good and it's a all over with and that's all of her life\nIt's still plays very very well\nWow uh what are they in any other machines you've you've played it on\n[noise] um I have tried it on ... like a math book air uh worked just fine um I have not tried yet on a chrome book I don't I don't have my hands on ... today um but as soon as I get my hands on why am I Am definitely want to try it out\nI don't think you'll see much of a difference there I think you I think you'll find the same uh the same performance really among the ... and that's exactly what I think they're trying to do with the project stream is to be like you know just play through your browser wherever you are log into your to your chrome and you can play on any machine\nOr essentially so uh I'm kind of interesting how that are kind of interesting how that plays out I've got a Mac ... proof from two thousand nine\nAnd once I get it all set up and done a I really want to launch into it on his two thousand and nine ... book pro and see how that fears for me I'm not expecting good things 'cause\nThis is this is old and I really haven't done much too and I mainly use this map of proof for uh\nJust work stuff I'm not much at all so I'm curious to see how we will how we will go [noise] so ah how how many how many how many hours will be put into it\nI'd probably put about ten hours into it so far like said you know being a dad with with reactive kids ah and and also going to school the limits how much time you get the game but I you know I've I've put it in a fair amount of time and and I must say that hey the game is pretty fun\nUh but be that again that technology is just stellar and and if this is the sign of where gaming is headed I'm actually okay with this\nUm it's it's one of those tricks where you have to understand that ... you know people understand hey there's a certain amount of bandwidth you have to have\nUm there's a certain amount of uh you need to have a computer that's always connected in the cloud needs to be frankly well\nWhat's the what's the bandwidth you're talking here\nSo my band was so they ... the funny thing about the goals that process when he launched the browse me launch projects stream the way that it works as it goes through a process in chrome where it actually ... able to check settings real quick on your machine\nTo let you know hey how are how are things going to go once that's done it launches the game in the browser and then the ... automatically oh wow okay\nYeah so it's it's it's it's pretty interesting how is the launch process go there and it lets you know right away hey the band with is good enough now what's interesting about it as I Know I'm I've got I've got four hundred down twenty up so it's not a slouch for Internet or here in Madison area going on in the\nTwentieth so nice [laughter]\nI\nWish I could get the gang of it but they are the the the company that does that around here decided not to put it in my neighborhood the rest of my city so that's fantastic\nYeah so yeah I mean here at work were good like we've got a hundred down hundred up [noise] um\nSo I mean we're fine but at home I think I've got like a hundred down and five up um it's not the best on my on my when my uploading type thing so\nAnd so would that be and with that for her down twenty up what's interesting is I Will get messages and the game saying that there is a there are a band with her congestion issues and it'll it'll leave a little box in a in the lower right hand corner of your screen letting you know hey there there's a streaming issue here hold escape\nAnd it'll show you a browser window as to what might be going on now I Will say that browser windows pretty much useless and didn't really tell me a whole heck of a lot about what was going on at the time they're admitted they ...\nDidn't notice any I didn't notice any slowdown I didn't notice any input lag that came from it it it all ran just fine so I I I don't know if that's just a bug in the beta or if it's some sort of limiting that Google doing early on as they're testing this out but it it's working fantastic\nYeah I'm really curious about it I I'm looking forward to setting that up at the house and and see how that goes a\nThe from what I was reading after I got accepted uh from what I was reading that I've got to we've got this until January the fifteenth is that correct\nThat is correct and then after that date you just lose access to the games but my hope to beat it before then\n[laughter] hey Kurt how's it going\nTo do that as well that is Matt Matt came home that I don't know and I do know cameras here I've I'm cheating here no that's fine that's fine ah so you said your ten hours in a roughly where are you still\nOn a like a Catalonia\nWhen I was a guy named bill did you go out and buy the game out of the game\nHow did you how do you have the game did you go out and buy the early birthday present you're fine if you did it it's okay I really early birthday I'm not I'm not like chastising you ... yeah well we talked about this he's like hey I got some money for my birthday I'm going to go out and get screened and I said\nHey you should hold off because that price is going to drop come Black Friday it always does it uh yeah so that's a screen always comes out in the fall and it always gets reduce ... Kevin and\nKevin's in busy the past week or so uh so I haven't been able to LA dangerous and I'm like you know I really want to play it so I have some birthday money so yeah I got it\nThat's fine I'm fine with that you you're well I'll go to your money any way you want yeah I'm just holding off until I'll pick it up for Black Friday at a reduced price will yeah are you still in the first island [noise]\nYeah I Am I I've I take I'm I'm obsessive about how I play assassins great and I I have is our hundred percent though so I Am I ... that is correct\nEvery side quest you got to do before even ... progress on right\nThat is correct that I just can they I don't I'm not OCD with any other game other than assassins created the only game I Do that\nWill drive you maybe a little bad e because of the bounty boards or have you heard of those\nAre not as if you learn about your first bounty when you do your first assassination stuff so I Believe\nWell I'm the different towns have that you can go to 'cause I just gotten past the first island where I got my boat\nUh so uh it's not that far if you're ten hours and it's probably not that far from where you're at unlike only level I just hit ten actually leveled and um but the the different a major cities or whatever and even on your show\nThey have a bounty board we could choose bounty has to do like little like extra side missions for money material and whatnot and those change daily\nSo you'll have like daily news Rooney on daily quests and I'm well as as far as I go out and it was within the game itself of just like the random cyclists you go to about like he'll help out this person or hey the girl's talking to you she wants to you know ... whatever so but then yeah you'll also have\nA I was noticing that for 'cause I'm the same way where ah I have to completely clear an area out before I really ... progress on\nAnd like with the origin or you know they had the different areas sort of like ... ... you need to be this level in between this level range where I get into an area and I like the synchronization I Would do all this stuff in that area and then I'd get to the next area synchronize do all this stuff and\nSo I'm a city about it too [noise]\nI'm I'm also starting ... and for right now and and that's also doing the same thing to be where I Need to go complete every race and I need to win them yes I'm living in Orlando and need to make thirst [laughter] yeah yeah I every single time so I if I if these two games are going to be my long term game for a little while here\nI did you play origin\nI did not I I'm ... got a little bit earlier I didn't have a chance to this time around 'cause I've been I'm busy with two kids\nYeah the interesting thing here is that you're you're playing the [noise]\nLike orange and kind of changed the dynamic of themselves they treated him out yeah like massively and now you're playing you know the built upon that yeah you're playing the sequel to that which is what they looked at and said let's see what works and what doesn't work for what we did on that and improve it even more yes land like\nYou know you're playing the version to a of of orange and yes and and and and discovering this whole new dynamic of advertisements greed is is now involved yeah a phone and I think that\nAbsolutely fantastic day\nI take it out but like uh yeah so that's ... extreme uh hopefully I can give you my assessment which probably won't be near as long as his next week just to say yeah pretty much what he says is exactly how it works 'cause\nUh I got into it earlier this week and completely forgot to get into it as one of those things where they email came at night I was ready to go to bed I thought oh I'll have to fire up tomorrow totally forgot I was there [noise] so uh yeah we're gonna take a break\nThis is\nThe next truck that we got here or something I pulled from\nI think we use it last year I really thought that my search for scary music games with a kind of Peter out there for a bit but I found this one from last year we used it it's an event that's coming up in destiny this week uh it'll start on Tuesday it's called the festival of the lost its there\nHow I'm using air quotes when they say this is their Halloween events\nAre in industry uh it does me too so this is the festival last music ... this is ... directly from the game so you're going to hear the game sound effects going on in the background or something I'm so because I could not find any of this uh\nOn line anywhere so\nThat's what we'll be back with more than game chat right up to this [noise]\n\n\n\nChevrolet Master control center says is W.

credits was the only music I could find for the game but then again when you're trying to find scary music\nFrom video games this is a lot of what you get ambient noise moody very little volume\nSubject join the interested enough to live in a layers of fear that'd be good I've usually as layers of fear\nDefinitely are you a festival the last I had already picked 'em but everything else is stuff that I haven't used ... trying to figure out what we have a New Year's New Year's it's tough because we've been doing this at least since twenty six team\nUh as far as like you know picking scary music to do during the month of October every single week seven tracks for about four weeks out of the year\nTwo years going on three this one\nSo that's a lot of tracks from from scaring games um\nBut recently I figured out how to do this was basically open up steam go to the horror tag and decide what's listed and then leg okay let me see if there's music from that let me see if there's music from this let me see if there's music from this\nAh which is a lot of what I did last night or the next one that we're gonna play comes from it's it's not a scary game per se but it is it does have a little a level that is fun\nFun horror seemed I guess you could say not even for the veggie tales\nIt's close okay yeah it's close so\nSneaking would be a good one that was ... sneaking music that I Am not for not ... not for Halloween but I have you sneeze or was it no no no it wasn't sneaking music because there wasn't much that tried to ... one day was a race or big card bumping or whatever was in\nWhich is what it was that are used for the from the Burger King games here three of them right there is a sneak king and big bumping racing and then there was\nAnd people are doing that good but ah that but you have to do a significant amount of times for um anything or\nIt may happen to you I can kind of understand that because like if your Internet you know it just goes down yeah I mean they don't want to be punished like oh man my Internet went down you can't but if you if you do it a couple of legitimate reasons ... asked to come up with them but you gotta ... species that that it went down just to ... he lost yeah yeah [noise]\nSo uh so we have eight so I had I gone up by those had those two games going for me this week\nAnd I know what else are we used to be dangerous splintered are swimmer so uh by the way there's a splinter cell sale on steep of\nIt's just fun to say splinter cell Phil Philadelphia on splinter cell on split yourself Dr got on stage felons better sale sputtered sounds\nAre but anyway you played a\nRumor or do you play the ... it is you played at least dangerous and I do read sniper leak for yes I I I concur with all that too um destiny just today I I got my\nMy all took to fifty level fifty okay so now new level cat well that's the new level kept me yes it's not you know then you had the light level right right right so\nI mean it's just been working on the ... just you know ... random who's in the chat room there as well and I were working on our old so we ran through the story again on her second characters\nAnd uh he got his up to fifty just recently and then I got mine up to fifty today so we can\nWe can now start tackling the uh all the stuff on on on two characters you know progress a little bit faster um\nAlthough we're not very far from from hitting the cap I'm at five eighty three or five eighty four to ... hundred cats I mean I'm not far from hitting the cap on the on the on the level of in\nThe in the lead the migraine in the chat room talking about it man sniper assassin makes me want to go play that some more [noise]\nI'd like to a U.S official snipers yeah yeah that's the one yeah one map you to sniping the is it just one map yeah okay well I I think it's just one math or I don't know if they've added any other apps yet I think they will when the game is falling\nReally you weren't here but early early you mentioned he was playing that and I said I think I've played that on my eye pad and my remembering they\nHad one for um the sniper challenged came out for 'em absolution a so they had one a long time ago then they had a mobile a version of the sniper challenge the one I think I'm playing yeah uh so it's in that vein\nAnd it seems to be the same map each and every time it's just like here's a guy that I got to go over to here's some different challenges that you know here's how you got killed but you need to kill these four other guys first and then kill this guy and then uh you know it\nJust ... the one map 'em for a hit man to that I Know that they release I don't think they have a second that far yet but um it's you know a a wedding event and he has three targets you know three primary targets than you have like their body guards\nInstead of like one of your college is too young to get rid of the body guards than the primary target or take out the primary targets in this way or hide the bodies is that all these different challenges that you could do\nYou know shoot some uh there's like some birds fly around and shoot the birds there is a plot to destroy ... you know\nAnd as you progress through when you do the different challenges you get more experience and then you could get better weapons more bullets upgrades to your sniper rifle all that kind of stuff\nIs just one map in Austria but yeah it's it's it's a lot of fun and so I'm looking forward to in some more levels or for that I'm looking forward to hit man to\n\nDo I because there's a lot of in the there's a lot of new stuff here that it's going to go by very very quick it wasn't like a heavy Newsweek or anything but uh we will talk about it\nSo going to go to a break here this is a track from a much beloved game uh there's not a hard game or a scary game or even kind of a Halloween game it just happens to have a level that takes place in a trance ... castle\nThat has nothing scary at all about your fight off the ... the pills I think you'd find often goes and then at the end you're fights whoever lives there and I can't remember who it is that actually lives there um\nBut it's a vampire but it all up but it is from ... oh yeah the trampoline you level from duck bills re mastered said was that ... can dispel I Can't remember if it was her or not because I Want to say I think it is served but then you have to play again at the end mhm and it is a\n... whatever the count Dracula or whatever but these are very empire and all yeah\nGot brings her mother was the green a yeah the green duck\nOr do you have to uh you have to fight them so um you're probably think twice anyway this is it will be back with more than ... right after this I think there's some dummy up and is it are the remake or the original ... okay I'm a ... it is it is anyway we'll be back right after the\nUh\nThe uh [noise]\nUm [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]

eastern boulevard like he says he closes seven today so we had on over there and enjoy the last of their anniversary sale that they've got going on today um\nI don't want to hit some really quick little things here from\nThe news that we had this week a blizzard now has issued a statement regarding cross platform play for Diablo three mhm\nUh it appears blizzard isn't actively working on the Oslo three crossed platform clay at present um\nThere are no plans to him we while we loved the idea of bringing our players together across platforms we do not have any plans to implement cross platform game play for Diablo at this time\nEarlier it had been reported that blizzard representative said the cross platform Diablo three total collection was a matter of when not if it went on to sit at the studios are actively working with partners at Sony and Microsoft to enable the feature but\nApparently that is not the case and hopefully that will change because a blizzard can do it that's also part of Activision Blizzard was also a part of bungee which is you know\nI don't need cross play from a destiny adjusting crossings I tell them so I can fire up my password and play with you guys that's all I won't even if after ... by forsaken get which by the way\nIf you know is that dropping\nHuh that'd be dropping forsaken will be dropping in price for Black Friday I can I can almost promise you I don't know exactly how much ... but it will see a discount yeah the I'm\nGoing to want to say was is that bungee announced this week that\nUh when you buy forsaken you will get the previous to deal sea packs for free [noise] a warm mind in in ... the the whatever that jazz\nYou'll get those two ... yeah you have to get those to deal sea packs for free if you had already purchased those ... ... and her playing forsaken now\nYou're going to get some free stuff come December in a way of um appreciate or that's only obtainable through this a free emblem that has only obtainable through having purchased forsaken already\nAnd two different exotic boats I think is what it's called [noise]\nI mean ... ... email us but that I think they're exotic the gold ones you have ...\nSo you get to the ones for free but you have to have bought forsaken and played the game\nYou know put your character on the new map tangled shore ah by October the sixteenth which is Tuesday so if that is of interest in you some people it's not that it's perfectly fine it doesn't matter for me because I had already bought it and I played it so I get it regardless [noise]\nI'm just like you know there was something that a lot of people haven't talked about or at least haven't made a reference to have plenty of people have put in their hands on Red Dead redemption to 'em but nobody mentioned this\nRather than eat feature that you won't see in the game unless you do something um specific\nOkay if you're playing the game\nAnd you have the mini map up whatever it's going to be fine just like any other game but if you turn your mini map off\nThe instructions that you get from your character's will include directions\nHuh so when they talk to you they'll tell you where to go like go out past whatever turn it the ... tree thing or whatever they'll they'll give you\nAm I to the location I might try that I'm\nTrying to use this in some sense of direction\nYeah ah with the essence creed honesty you could do it normal or explorer mode and ... they like really limit the amount of ah I ... on a screen and it's more you know you have to\nFind things\nSo Scott as like a so is are they going by landmarks or would they tell you something like you have to go east about uh\nTwo lousy hundred paces you notice them either the uptick to this that I did not know about\nLet me read this real quick\nThat has the old burnt down the house the old Clint nice to have\nWhich one [laughter] and then at least at the ... to ... like that just a catch ...\nYeah well um 'cause uh\n'cause sometimes like a when you're in the game world you know you could see a little question mark over here like oh I Need to go that way or whatever it can you know\nIt's\nNot as obvious you know so you you do the compass up at the top and it\nDoes sort of you know let you know and there are stuff around yet but yeah it it's more exploration based ... I I like to that I'm playing it that way so far\nYou know well there's a whole right up on this thing a preview there was done [noise]\n[noise] and there's one where there are number of ways to interact with your horse if you strap a kill to its back ... you better wash the blood off once you sell the meats otherwise you'll attract predators are really ... [laughter]\nThat that would be less featured if you don't wash the blood off Cooper man fixing the other parents [noise]\nThat's something you didn't know you don't even think about um\nYou don't even think about uh really was you\nKnow now I Want to know I wouldn't\nKnow you want your horse to perform its best it needs food and love the more you interact with it the better your bond that comes with a better bond you can even partake in some dress itch or you can also whistle to your horse from greater distances [noise] uh\nWho your horse won't teleport you like in most games that has to manually make its way to you and your horse can die permanently no no if you family injured your horse you can revive it with a special kit if you don't have the kid you might have to trick into town to get one before your horse bleeds out\nEverything you read the introduction to the world is built to fold is built to fold into some other system creating emerging moments where the world when you walk into your Base Camp which moves around the environment is a story because as your gang members talk to you there as well they don't wait for specific story moment to activate the rate react to you like any other NBC\n\nChevrolet Master control so this is\nW.

humble host and legal maniac with an inferiority complex mandating with the mind and body infected with the progressive bio weapon the powers that shouldn't be called more gallons disease findings Teri Adams welcome to the program\nProducing tonight's program will be with me a little short main woman has also co hosting with me tonight is as always postman welcome postponed I'm Glad you're here to be under it is good to be here is good to be alive on this little blue ball as it bounces around through space\nUm folks I we don't want you to believe a single word you hear because you have to be challenged to do your own research come to your own conclusions 'cause I got to tell you listening to what they considered authority that's what got us in the mess we're in today folks were in trouble\nWe can provide the basics but you have to connect the dots and satisfy yourself that what indeed is truly happening isn't happening before we can even hope to delay it if it's in biblical prophecy it cannot be stopped is my opinion I think it can be delayed but it cannot be stopped in God's time as always perfect now\nThe number here in the plush dimly lit blue water studios is to seven to nine to two and now there's been some controversy lately on this very network regarding the telephone callers\nI welcome your calls because all of us have different experiences I Believe we can all learn one from another however I find myself in a quandary because once I start reading what I feel are important things to you and the phone interrupts me it's very hard for me to get back and remain focus\nThe other reason than I'm used to be the other reason is that I'm used to being on the other hand the collar end than I Am on this in the talk show host and and I hated always happy to be put on hold for long periods of time I simply don't have the patience to hold for any length of time so I don't\nAnd I don't like to see the phone line flashing Hal I'm trying to focus on whatever it is I'm trying to focus on it bothers me so it is for these reasons that I wait until the second or maybe even a third I were to open up the phone to hope you don't feel offended by that\nYou know once I Do open them up I I feel like we're all adults so we don't need to be taught how to call in and how to speak to the host on a radio program at least I Hope that's the case\nAlso this show is very different from the others I'm different now I don't work here\nSo the colors are different just like I Am and I and I'm okay with that\nThat some of you can be long winded which is fine as long as what you bring to the table makes it worthwhile and have found that usually to be the case I only issue with callers is when someone who has it been listening calls in and asked me to go through what we've been talking about that's not fair to the other callers who had been listening and that hurts me a little bit\nIt's okay I wasted enough time on the subject\nThe last four years I've been urging all of you to have a plan in case something really catastrophic happens tonight I Want to repeat that message because the radicals in this country have now been given the stage to try their hand in overthrowing America\nAnd that goes across the whole landscape of everything not just racing but everything the moment money becomes your motivation you're immediately not as good as someone who is stimulated about passion in internal we'll\nThat's why it's so important if you're able to follow your passion in life whatever that is if you can make a living\nFulfilling your passion then you're living the real truth what's supposed to be the American dream just remember that I was lucky enough to do that and that's that's rooted in your real Cole creative spark if that was put in your prime period but they called us so it's a little bit of God that we all\nHave within us that's what the enemy wants so badly because you have no idea how powerful you are you don't have a clue who you really are\nThat is so so true okay James Madison before the president of these United States in who's also was hailed as the father of the Constitution's said\nA popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy perhaps both knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a person who remain to be their own governors must armed themselves with the power which knowledge gifts why don't you think\nThe powers that shouldn't be the six you are loose appearing psychopathic families why do you think they went to such links to obtain control of our media why do you think they did that because I mean I you know I had an epiphany the other night thinking about this\nHow do how do we find out what landed on them and how do we find out Kennedy was killed all these huge moments in the history of this country we learned it from the press oh my God they now got control and maybe they've always had control of the press do you understand how much miss direction and damage they can do\nThey can make us believe anything they want to make us believe they can make us believe they can actually set off a nuke in New York in say Russia fired a missile we're ... we're retaliating who how you're going to know the difference it's scary how much power the press has and it's pretty obvious to me that they are totally totally corrupt\n[noise] anyway [noise]\nUh sometimes people don't want to hear the truth because they don't want their illusions destroyed\nAnd that was a believe that was ... that said that never argued stupid people they would drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience and that was Samuel alone when Clemens I get a Mark Twain\nThe truth seeing the truth but still the leading the lies can you say Kim trails folks [noise] a Mel Gibson's character Nick Marshall in the movie what women want it's never too late to do the right thing\nA man\nAbsolutely correct ... as the Fonz would say an absolutely right Hi list bounce into the show notes here um [noise] well just recapping what I just said\nHow do we traditionally learn what's going on in our world the media\nI don't think we realized exactly how misled we've all been in every area ... my thing is I Love cars motorcycles I've always loved that kind of stuff so those are the areas that I feel like I'm pretty up speed on\nTechnology in those areas\nBut I don't understand is if technology in the automobile sector had followed the same a flow chart or the same graph as technology in the um\nComputing world\nWe would be drying driving flying cars that got six thousand miles a gallon so I think I think what's happening is they're holding on to all this technology this free energy all this stuff because what it's all about money\nIt is all everything is about money on this planet everything\nThey have siphoned off trillions in trillions in trillions of dollars for their secret space program\nAnd maybe I'm wrong here but I think that goes back to alternative three Eisenhower you know they were worried about deep uh overpopulation and all the resources of the planet being sucked up by too many people they worried about this in the forties folks\nSo Eisenhower commission them to come up some some ideas of how they could control the population and the third of the three ideas was settled law planet well what if they had been working on that ever since and what if they have settled a planet\nYou really have to wonder about that I mean I I Believe maybe they have\nIt is not what if it's a matter of uh\nIf a man or is it is a matter of it being confirmed\nIt and and there's the problem because when we took all those Nazis from paper clip\nWho had been in control and God the stuff they did to the Jewish people in the concentration camps\nHow we got so much knowledge from that's how entail ultra that's how they figured out how to put somewhat there's so much pain and misery that their brain compartmentalized desert splits\nThat's how this whole impales or thing that's what fuels it is all this stuff and the Nazis suddenly they have a way to use you anywhere they want to use you and you don't remember being used\nAnd the government with the with the with the advent of um ... you know going to go into an architect his butt kicked and um yeah\nAnd um and that was the deal they they let him live and send them back and and told them or um the or the mouse has told them what what they want it they weren't all there are all there are other scientists come over the United states\nAnd I'm In that way oh he's on the first the first time he went down there okay yeah well actually ... I think it was the er or was it was it was in the aftermath of the of the slaughtering that they took\nWhen they went down there gotcha okay you're talking about how ... yeah and they took they took his on the first time it would take a plane and ah and brought her name would attract or being yes now who is that he talked to then\nHe talked to the ... okay 'cause that's he said he saw what looked like Nazi site symbolism buddy couldn't place\nIt right actually these are these wars have noticed they vary from I'm from the chores constellation or from\nEr I'm okay and um and they were the ones that were happening happened Germany back in the early or one of the late thirties early forties\nI've seen pictures of that they were on the Internet or a on YouTube for a very very short time than they were scrubbed\nPretty freaky little gray looking things with Nazi uniforms on\nRight and um that's the ah the curb being you know for every uh uh for every system that's in the December quarter or the galaxy maybe you know who knows\nAnd um and there from what I from what I hear than all\nFifty two star systems that we have a a in a local group and these are bad guys are good guess uh they uh they go to the highest bidder and some of them are hours yeah some of them are a celestial horse yeah some of them or or um what was true\nOr or um or you know they they they act benevolent and there's all all\nAll according to you know whatever their their control about who's who their control but I hate that they're so are they are they real ... beans or are they like robots or uh some of them are um won't created being if you ask me all all of them if he's not ON Technology\nBut but some of them are on someone will I Bork someone will have biological and have a um\nAnd have you know technology in other words you know ... much computer chips and so on and so forth yeah that uh\nYou know that trans humanism is something that just totally scares me because if you could see what I see if you were going through what I'm going through in into stuff I'm pulling out of my body it scares me and\nI guess the advantage I have you have an advantage because what you've seen what happened to you when you were a kid that's your advantage when you have a system of belief is built upon your personal experience has all of ours is\nMine is knowing that something's coming out of me that's a ... being these fibers that are alive but the CDC says oh no no no no you're delusional these things aren't real eye that\nTherefore I Know the CDC's line I Know they are so I Know they can't be trusted so that gives me an advantage that's my basis of understanding\nThe people that are listening to us you know we're asking them to step out on faith because they have an experience will be ... what we've experienced the folks [laughter]\nYou don't want to experience what we've experienced you really don't but please please listen to us and just do a little bit of research and I think you're going to find what Washington straight with you about this stuff is really going on\nI mean it it it all come to it in for a long\nIt's coming yeah it's coming in the Bible says men will think from the year for what's come upon this er well I can guarantee you that's the case because I see them I Know they're here and they haven't been revealed everyone yet it's coming\nIn his coming I mean what else are is there such a deliberate intent to to save everyone right now\nEverywhere you look at they're just sitting there trying to distract us to Deceive Us they don't want us to be up to speed on what's about to happen\nAnd they keep us in a dark where where it was a ... you know in our in our galaxy and now you take you to India\nYou take a a all Middle Eastern countries you take Egypt and uh I mean you if you could talk to talk to somebody that's a a an adult and on and tells you to do over there in one country [noise] they'll tell you that everything that we're talking about exist you don't tell you\nWhat was it that she had another reason for them to take over the media\nMoney but I tell you something that we've been misled on in my opinion is when they talk about\nI'm going over there off the off shore and they're being attacked by these supposedly Somali pirates or whatever over there what these people are doing is because the developed countries Waco when dumped\nAll our stuff off the off the shores are old a ... mercury all the bad stuff we just dump it over there because I mean they're not they're dark skinned people who cares right\nSo now they're like wait a minute why are you using us that's why they have pirates that they're trying to stop the developed countries from using them just as a basically a landfill\nAnd I get that you would do the same thing that's kinda how I look at it you would do the same thing so that\nHillary Clinton [noise] and the most the most recent democratic presidential candidate and leader of her party and I mean part tae\nOpenly endorsed viciousness against her political opponents she said that civility can return once Democrats but Democrats craps regain some power in the house the Senate\nMeanwhile the

created by Republicans to the mid term elections\nCould lowered a you know I read a ...
