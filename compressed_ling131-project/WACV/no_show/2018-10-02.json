I don't know if he does rap stuff or not I like to ask him but that was offering Percival this'll bomb it don't sound like rapper\nWell you know uh Rodney Dangerfield bitter rat record I did I have to find it for you ask called called wrapping Rodney rapidly I guess you know if there's enough money in anything anybody will do it so\nBut he sure can rhyme yes they can and I guess there's reasons\nThat he does that well you know it's funny you should say that because the rhyme or reason you you got to have one to have the other\nPretty much I guess pretty much mhm it has to make some sense yes but the thing about the stock market mhm is it does that make a lot of sense a lot of people are saying there's\nNo rhyme or reason to what's going on right now well people have been trying\nTo predict what the stock market is going to do I don't know\nIn you know if something happens you know some catastrophe somewhere sometimes the stock market types and little by way of people's law predicted that when you know yeah right but can you tell me what's going to happen in two or three years now right nobody can't nobody can ah ...\nThere's a lot of predictors and there's a lot of ... out there the the only thing is is that what goes up comes down yeah we know that and ah but the rhyme or reason behind it is just that really solid um\nThere's reasons why it comes down after the fact I mean they'll say well just like you said we predicted that and we knew that that was going to happen because back in two thousand nine we say that in two thousand we\nWere we missed it by two or three years but we said that they would have happened in ... well you know if you look around and I'll take my yeah something's going to give give 'cause it always goes up and it always goes down and sideways and upside down and eat it does all kinds of things but the problem\nThat you should be looking is not whether it's going up or down it does that all the time and in in and when it's going up and down it does it in a way that uh\nIs usually on the upward climate until it has one of those big drops you know what I'm saying so but if you're if you're if you're buying in on it like that that's that that should be okay if you're young enough\nBut the rhyme or reason a is when you're not young at a ... is a\nThere's a lot of reason not to be doing it the same way when you're older age she did when he real you\nKnow when you're younger you do a lot of things ... issue like walking and yeah and getting up from a chase it really is going up and down staircases\nExactly uh although my mother in law really would go up the staircases wind up to just a few weeks before she died she still would go in there I could get her to stop doing that and then she gets mad at me 'cause uh we'd follow behind her should fall and should this doesn't make us or angry\n\nTo health and well show with David aren't as you can call David at three three four two seven nine seven four three one go to his Web site at retirement was Ernest dot com savings on Facebook\nAs the health and well the show was David Ernest there you'll find a link to David ... YouTube channel and it has a lot of old programs and some comedy to keep you laugh and now here's the man who knows who puts the ball and the ball ball ball it's David\nIron is [noise] they get arrested man I appreciate that again a man just glad to be here and you know if you want to call David I think\nI mentioned this earlier maybe not to seven nine seven four three one call David Ernest today and you know it's like it's almost like here in the show with David aren't just right there in front of every all kind of good information things is going to help you get a financially secure for the future\nYou know when you go and you get a sermon out there I remember some sermons that I used to in the you know the get all excited about some things ... and when you get to talk about certain topics I get kind of excited\nAbout it um because I'm concerned yeah and uh when you're talking about this rhyme or reason of the times of the times in your life\nIn other words you there's there's a there's a reason there's no rhyme to why you do the things you do when you do\nAnd you should do it um it the right times when you're acting like here sixteen years old when you're sixty five ... ... it does make a lot of sense you're not immoral\nAnd neither is a sixteen year old but sixteen year olds do have enough more time unless they get damaged\nOr to correct for mishaps yes we don't have as much time to correct for mishaps\nAnd when we're in a cyclical a economy a cyclical stock market a cyclical everything everything has cycles we were born we grow up\nWe tour mhm we get old we are\nOkay at pretty much sums it up right they said so if you're in the somewhere in the tour and get no\nSomewhere in there you're in a cycle you're in the cyclical part of it that you need to be protecting your body\nProbably more than anything which means you need to be going to the doctor you need to go into your dentist you need to be paying close attention to\nEverything that could ditch you to the older part to them so that you won't fall off the ledge so to speak to quick although we know we all virtually will fall off the ledge Rio somewhere in the world would be flat in this scenario if you do come to an end\nBush got some ... got some flat spots in it yeah but\nWhat you don't want to do is follow the pothole before you get to the I mean and fall into some kind of trap and are able to walk out I'll be able to walk down if you do that we got to do an Elvis river I Know I Know if I could allow you hang on a minute left is a law\nThere's these bans a lot of them think that the song is called called it a trap it's actually called suspicious mind and they don't they all think everybody remembers that caught the trial yeah [noise] and then what are you trying to trying to you when you're you're excuse I Need [laughter] um have several frogs mother or rent paid way\nWhen you get caught in a trap and a ... at the wrong time ... it's ... it's hard to get out you know are not ever that everybody has a Baylor mhm the bail you out well\nThat's another thing about that so and I think I've told you this before ... suspicious minds that's Elvis ... that can give you a year out on top of my head I'm losing the seventies it's got to be but the thing is they just didn't\nPlay songs on the radio they're much more than two two and a half three minutes in those days that wrong is close to five minutes long he has a long and the short version well what he did with the long version though mhm is you will hear it and you're going to probably go home and listen you'll hear it and it saves about\nThree and a half minutes it's like yeah but then it fights back up well Elvis did that yeah so that is your bail out if you're on a radio station there's not going to play that fool version to measure bailout point do you go ahead and complete the fade and go into your next record\nAnd that you know I'm Sorry oh you push the button so the computer will play the next song right and uh that that's your bailout point on the on that saw mhm and what you're talking about a bailout point for your finances\nYeah you need to have a way to fade out the bad\nGuys right man tagging run with it I like you got to have a fighter knob in other words a technological thing to say the bad at it how do you do that\nYou don't want to fall into the trap you'd need to have some kind of a ... mechanism to to pull you out and that's what we do we have programs that will still let you\nGrow in the stock market mhm grow with the stock market should I say that\nIf something goes wrong we ... we got you know you're fine you're not gonna fall in that trap you're not going to you're not going to lose your money when the crash comes\nNow there are things that go wrong so you're out cooking out if you're not barbeque in that because that's a different time but if you're a cook and ask that you guys not dogs and hamburgers over there and you leave the hotdogs all man you burn ... right when you ...\nOver here that's that's that's that's bad yeah but then you got the tap panic coming across the ocean ... hitting that iceberg and say now that I don't know I think if you look up disaster in the dictionary there should be a picture of the Titanic next to it and\nThere I don't think there's any way to prepare for that but if you're heading fruit treacherous waters there is a plan for you\nDavid you got it and he will help you figure out\nHow to navigate those dangerous waters and avoid the icebergs and not burned you're waiting common to seven nine seven four three one\nThank you [laughter] we wouldn't want to have a ... no no no no this is where I mean there's burnt than his wood is Bert\n... [laughter] as mailed to good I have a winning All right when you die when you drop it in the dirt ah but [laughter] oh\nThis was going to make it you think [laughter] and I I think we're when a ... there's the\nCycles the cyclical a part of the stock market is that it is going to correct sometimes in the wrong time mhm are you\nThat is to make as you get as you age you need to to be in this\nKind of portfolio that will adjust automatically are protect you automatically ... uh where you will fall in that hole\nAnd no you don't make as much money you can now you can make more money and the reason why is you can make more money when everybody else falls down fifty percent mhm you hadn't failed down you need you might actually made some money so uh that's fifty percent return if you think of it in reverse\nAnd a lot of people say well what in the world are you talking about returns in reverse yeah that's it if you if you're if you're in a program\nThat falls down fifty percent and we didn't go to ... per se like like the majority of people did try and you made reverse compound interest because you reverse what everybody else did you didn't fall and the whole\nAnd are you still get you do so\nIt didn't go it didn't go and you're not all upset and so so so so so I Love the term\nReverse compound interest asked one of 'em there's another there's another woman you can come talk to me about it or another one that even though the market didn't fall down we still make more money than you are pay you more money over time then you would have made\nThere's all kinds of protection mechanisms you should be looking at the general market the general investment environment is just to buy a bunch of stuff and hope it goes up yeah but there's ways to have your bats are ... you know when people go to the casino\nIf their professional casino ... uh gamblers yeah they have such a\nThere's this thing like double down on 'em there's this thing about old ... heard it before oh that person has been playing on that ah you know one arm banned it for a long time and it\nIs it going to kick off he didn't go well those\nThese bad analogies that I'm using here uh-huh but the point I'm trying to make is you need to hedge your bets right you're betting on the future which you need to hedge my always have\n... off Donald has a friend who goes to the casino a lot and ah she says the bore you bet the more likely you are to win because you know you go in and there's like these the minimum bad is I don't know fifty cents mhm sure you you might win but if you bet\nTwo three four dollars or a role or a span you're more likely to hit the jackpot so you know a lot I think a lot of people just go\nA judge it's great to talk to my friend how are you I'm fine thanks how are you I'm very well um so your your take on this reopening of the FBI investigation background check into Kavanaugh\nThere are some Republicans who say well this is a good thing because it uh gives cover to people like flake can Collins or to actually vote for cabin on in the end\nYou know this has been about I'm delighted from the get go\nAnd um I think what's most eloquent here is the treatment that this guy from from ... said well this person asked for confidentiality [noise] um [laughter]\nThis could have been investigated by the FBI honoring old requests for confidentiality from the outset if that's what they wanted and um I think everything has to be judged in light of that [noise]\nWanted it to me it seemed very obvious from the very beginning when they were interrupting the hearing and screaming and sending the protesters in and rotating protesters coming into the air and screaming at him\nThat this was going to be a farce and so it didn't really surprise me given the fact that the last ... believes the Supreme Court just another a super legislature\nAnd it's not really a chord it's more of a social policy making body to the left and for them it's all abortion and and various social issues and cabinet even though he's a Bush guy\nOr doesn't matter and he's a fifth vote and so by any means necessary judge\n[noise] well um I suppose we could have an interesting conversation about how it came to be that who gets appointed came to be so important that as one judge has started I'm putting their own gloss on what are actually fairly\nLimited a statement from the constitution that happened a long time ago\nWhen when when when when justice Douglas found a right to privacy in what he called him a nation's from ... numbers for rounding the other amendments I'm quite clear that\nSome people on the court for the were that they could make it up as they went along [noise] and so then I guess it very much batters who whose head is popping out from beneath the black Craig [noise]\nJudge there was a a woman I never heard of but she was on MSNBC over the weekend who identifies herself as a Watergate prosecutor just Jill Jill wind banks\nNow so she she she know express something that I began you you're beginning to here of course on college camps even her hearing it for years but it's actually entered the mainstream namely the race of Brett Kavanaugh has come into play let's listen\nThere is a white male privilege for infants here which is I'm entitled to this I did the hard work in high school and college and I deserve this was the end of that is not the case no one is entitled to be on the Supreme Court\nAnd no one who is behaved in high school and in college as his alleged to do and no one who performed the ways of hit it on Thursday deserves to be even an judge\nReaction to the judge\nUm it's [laughter] it's a parody of itself um this got nothing to do with race I'm like I Can't understand how that gets dragged into it [noise]\n[noise] um and the notion that somehow how one appears to be or appeared to be um in high school [noise] um determines what one can do in life is I think we're to kill us\nI mean this this is now the new standard apparently but not for liberals conservatives Republicans won't do this to the other side we had conservatives supporting Sotomayor and Kagan ... you're not going to have it play the other way but for Democrats\nYear high school I don't know why why high school when I go back to sixth grade wise just high school the limit here but it it it all reflects on your ear character and I find it interesting because they're always about you know ... letting these you know\nUseful indiscretions pass and they're all about well everyone should have redemption and but not for this if you're a conservative you can never be redeemed never\nRight or you have to do is is is have somebody claim that just stepped over the line once and that's it [noise]\nSo now they're actually they have some people on the record saying well we saw him at Yale we saw him a ... a drunk and he got belligerent a few times and so he doesn't have the temperament so the new question judges as a former federal judge yourself\nThe idea of temperament because he was fairly aggressive in responding of the questions on Capitol Hill a last week that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court after having written two hundred decisions on the DC circuit he doesn't have the temperament\nBut that's a great I'm no when proposition um if he gets upset um having been accused of um a sexual assault than he doesn't have the temperament if he doesn't get upset that he's guilty so it's you know if he loses either way [noise]\nRight well how do you think this ultimately plays out I mean that ... Democrats are of course are complaining that there's not enough I guess they interviewed that Deborah Ramirez over the weekend a hopped on that fast right or or even said FBI can has free rein that's the phrase he gave free rein a\nWell free rein to do presumably what the\nSenate requested um the Senate requested um [noise] a limited extension of the background check\nAnd background checks are are not about you know are not about criminal criminal investigations and then I ... ... counter intelligence less to get their background investigations and interview witnesses lay out what they say and presented to the sun which ultimately makes the decision to finish the not the president [noise]\nThe way and I'm On all of this so I use it you know he's weighing in on Kavanaugh saying that he's\nYeah he's loaded up the the the expectations 'em by talking about the capabilities of the FBI without discussing water background investigation as\nWell again if if high school and college drinking is now\nIs now from the free love generation this is this is a this is now yeah what we're going to be judged on I I don't know who want want these\nThese nominations I mean I don't know a lot of people frankly he didn't have something to drink in high school or college a few but not many and we all did stupid stuff and not you judge 'cause you just said\nOh heaven for fan right yeah no nothing nothing stupid\nNothing new but it all your your your him UK is what the rest of us did\nNo um [noise] I if there's anybody who um would be willing to have every day of of as you've um penned up on a wall and examined then that person I don't think as a life of that would give them any kind of experience worthy of being a judge\nOr the other issue I just wanted to quickly weigh in on this um\n[noise] the American bar association a supposedly it was it was of course it was improperly reported early on uh that the a BA had withdrawn its recommendation that a judge Kavanaugh was you know highly qualified to be in the heart and turns out it was it\nThe president of the of the APA pick up a pen and at his letterhead ah and wrote something he wasn't authorized to writes um he's not the committee and um it was simply another reflection of the fact that ... is is is generally left wing organization has been for years\nAnd he was a big supporter of Hillary Clinton uh and so\nYou know they again initial reports all over cable on friday when I was on the panel on Fox in the morning on friday and it was a BA withdraws and again headline writers and written reporters don't do their work they say oh this is ... that's really bad\nAnd now of course we find out that that's all all not true a judge thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate your insights and and we'll check back with you and you're listening to the Laura Ingraham show eight five five forty Laura Jeff Flake a lot of you from Arizona calling in chime in uh\nErie action to what he did on friday and his appearance at the global citizen festival with a\nWith his friends senator Coons and also on on his appearance on sixty minutes on Sunday he's enjoying his little waning power\nThat someone has power over you they think they have power over you they enjoy that that there are certain people that like exercising power over others and they take advantage of it I think this is his last gassed and he's enjoying every minute don't go well\nWhat are\nThe chances that we were going to be in exactly the same place a week from now\nYou know Baba Christmas there's not too far around the corner on Thanksgiving if you need some gifts for your friends and families\nWe've got those at talk pecan company don't forget about the ... to tell them where you're located\nWe're located at three fifty north McDonald street downtown among their immune\nFrom riverside Chevrolet Master control center says is W.

never would have a they never would have asked for a delay in this a confirmation about\nWell I mean [noise] yeah it is about the fifth vote but there isn't a symmetry there and that sense that\nWhen the Republicans are worried about a ... a swing vote or they don't do this I mean they didn't go after when sort of my years said I Believe that a wise Latina mixed better decisions in a white male they didn't go scholar and say you're a racist and we're going to stop your they didn't go after a lane at Kagan's so early college years\nAnd they they just don't do that I mean they disagree Merrick

has an asymmetrical response if this was a fifth liberal vote there would be very angry and they would try to go over all the liberals opinions and say you know in this case taking us down the road to

going all the people and also um you know hanging out at strip clubs by the way in South Donny Deutsch\nWell I think what's happening in the Democratic progressive movement is that\nThey've created this Frankenstein monster and the doctors who created are afraid of being the vow or you see it with Diane Feinstein here in California if you believe that how we appear Judy case who we are that is

quote unquote\nOf color and the same thing is true of Chuck Schumer and the string things through cones there's a lot of old white guys on the Democratic side Richard Blumenthal and old white guy\nBut they seem to think that that rule doesn't apply to them because they're liberal in their joining this new way but there are also doing it out of fear\nBecause they know that the logical ramifications

a\nPeople they should all be up in arms here I mean where do they get to go they go to get their own representation on boards\n[noise] yeah I think that's a coded for a lot of very affluent women in the bay area who want to be a lot of these boards on there and that's where all of the decisions are made and so they want to mandate or inclusion but again\nYou're seeing a fault line because you you hit it on the head and that is once you go down the idea that how we look\nWill be a Jew Jew to Kate who we are and we have to do it in tribal fashion and indeed in percentage fashion of the population than there are so many different tribes with claims\nOf victimization and reparation that's almost impossible to include them all so you're gonna have you're going to see a woman say well I

to\nI Can't hear it that way we're playing that version of it but he was actually on stage on SNL and wearing a make America great again hat he got food he got ... got harassed backstage he said for a for actually having the hat on and supporting Trump so the left or will not tolerate any dissent Victor\nYeah I think there's two things going on one is that this Trump idea that you close the borders to only legal immigration and then you try to get the economy up at four percent GDP low unemployment means that people who are Americans ever been over look like a lot of people in the inner city suddenly they have leverage\nAnd they have worth and that's a kind of a revolutionary messy so where else than others are starting to see and that's a lot better for interests that are people that would be patronize wide government the title of the other thing that kind of reminds us that we want to get hung up on identity politics we always have to have the after its identity politics\nWest it doesn't really matter you're black anymore because you have the wrong ideas and if you're ... you know Keith Ellison\n'em and you're charged with sexual assault well it doesn't really matter because

rigging projects that I have an light or ... per paycheck um can read about in a relief the time that I wanted to say to that I Am fortunate to have parents kind enough to let you have been like free\nSense for us okay what do you make\nUm monthly about eleven hundred\nIn is that and that's after graduating say okay what is your degree\nIt's actually call in college but um I've actually got a job with the teachers to help me find I'm a career and\nSo when we're your career kick in\n[noise] um I'm I'm actually thinking of clients now I'm On I'm going to miss money she said that my education take the call oh I'd say about another speaks like flew by year\nOkay well at eleven hundred a month we're talking about a little over Thirteen thousand dollars a year that's you're not going to you're going to make it on that in Raleigh out on your own okay you're not making enough to do that so we've got to get your income up that's why I was asking and so um yeah we need a double your income\nWell pretty quick here as fast as you can and when you can double your income and then I Would go get a you know an inexpensive apartment maybe a roommate or whatever and just get started on your own and the main thing there is make sure you have no dad do you have any debt at all\nUm they had about a hundred and down and hide twelve thousand dollar then get 'em which my parents um I signed up to 'em that they're taking care of that you can establish more credit\nWhere do you mean they're taking care of that\nSo they they came and put some money and they offered him I pay a whole not alone off yesterday\nOr the you know we don't need you to establish any more credit you don't need any bad you you don't make enough money to breathe hardly okay so when you are one hundred percent that free\nAnd then you build an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses like five thousand dollars a set aside\nFor emergencies then you would start saving towards your home and by then you are also in your first apartment and you just start saving as fast as you can and you won't put down as much as you can possibly put down how old are you you said you're twenty four\nOkay go ahead or you got a good plan so hopefully in the next twelve to Eighteen months you can see that income spike up as you start using your cosmetology degree\nAnd um because you know your Thirteen thousand when it gets you twenty six thousand we're going to regain this doubling of they're still not a lot of money but then at least get you out there and get you moving in and get your career to start to build\nSo hey thanks for the call we appreciate you listening Ian is with us a prince Edward Hi Ian how are you\nI Do thanks for taking my call sure what's up my wife and I we've got five boys five kids and we just moved into our dream on all three years ago or ten twelve acres of our through because it could turn around but the last few months which is your plan where in baby steps you know\nAnd we're just thinking um when we got thirty five thousand besides the house and we're just not sure\nIt could be that free or which is called the next ten Fifteen Years and just make it happen\nTen to Fifteen Years we maintain our house and everything\nYeah like well where were you know we have Twenty years left her mortgage mhm so what's your house you can come about Seventy to take home pay take home but All right yeah and um then what is your house payment [noise] it is around twelve hundred a month\nOkay how's payments not on the line here that's fun ... but you got a lot of kids who you're you've got a lot of kids and you're not used to living on a limited budget and you're going to start that\nWere egg yeah\nBecause you've got thirty thirty five an hour to clean up I mean you really need to clean that up it's probably going to take you year and a half two years but something like that you need you know longer than two years you need to have this debt cleaned up right what is the thirty five thousand in debt what kind of bet\nA lot or the longer parents and part of it is lamb credits twenty five on a credit and kind of grand alone from our parents\nOkay All right so just a line of credit what'd you bond with a lot of credit oh it's just been life has just been there about a piano a few years ago [noise] I'll just misleading claim\nOkay and that's over right yeah not doing that anymore right\nNo no no we were like we are just sick and tired we just want to be free\nYeah we love the place I don't think they need I don't think you need to sell the house houses now killing at twelve hundred bucks out of a fifty eight hundred dollar take home by not out of line\nYou're oh you're okay on our house but you do have to get your written budget get on every dollar you're written budget and get that going as quick as you can every dollar dot com and I'm starting to you know using the app on your phone\nAnd you guys need to squeeze every dollar so that you clear there's thirty five 'cause if you include the thirty five you're going to have pretty good room in this budget even with five kids and you can clear I did just going to take a year and a half two years just a year and a half two years or Seventeen five a year out of Seventy thousand take home that's doable\nYou can do that as a lay down and you can do that a thirty five thousand out of Seventy thousand with five kids that means one year I don't think you're going to do that so somewhere between the one in the two and that's how I'm landing on Eighteen months Richard is with us Richards in Salt Lake City Hi Richard how are you\nGoing great got how can I help [noise]\nI'm Wondering about emerging until we have a fully funded an emerging that are of the three to six months [noise] good to have about Fifteen thousand in there [laughter]\nI'm at my job offered him a chip they account on they match up to Fifteen hundred dollars a year [noise] great um should\nShould I fully fund the account and shit I count towards any lower\nEmergency fund\nHoly funded to get that match that's wonderful in the ... of course can only be used for one kind of an emergency and that's medical bills lots of other kinds of emergencies pop up and so um do you do you do both of you work in this house or as a single income\nSignaled I'm OK and what's your household income around sixty and what do you do er nurse\nA nurse okay very very stable career meaning that if you were to lose a job you can get another one in twenty minutes\nNursing is just a fabulous career field so in terms of ah accessibility even had ours anytime you want to add\nHours you can back it off you can change direction all kinds of stuff you just really and landed in a sweet spot there so very very good on that given that you've got that type of a career that's not so specialized\nBut you're six minutes um then given that that's the situation I Would back and you ... if a bond that I just say between the three to six months of expenses range I Would back down to about three months\nAgo and so that's kind of like partially leaning on the age of say as part of your emergency fund but it's certainly not we're not really counting it because I mean you can have lots of emergencies that have nothing to do with medical on your life when you\nGet your again you could lose a job you could um have the death of a relative and you had to pay for a funeral or wanted to pay for the funeral you can have all kinds of different things happen transmission blow out the car and all kinds of things that can happen let our medical and you can't use the ages for anything but medical [noise]\nSo I don't generally counted in the emergency fund but I'm looking at your career stability and the fact\nYou got a big fat I just I was a big fat match on it which is just wonderful both of them then that makes me very comfortable being almost three months side of the three to six months\n\n\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse or you have kids yes you need term

your investments around a fruit jar you'll come out better\nSo I mean literally just bury it in a coffee can in the backyard you come out better Colton is in British Columbia Hi Colton how are

twenty six children and ensure loans and argument over how much of that car\nI'm going to be known as the car because for most of it's a car okay\nA five hundred new school mhm and I wanted to use that savings that I Need to kind of put a down payment on new home but after listening to show not exactly sure how she go about it\nAnd then what's your household income\nTo five\nGood for you okay well I I Want you to get into another home I don't want you to do that with a debt so we've got two options um one is pay off everything and rent for a little while and save up a down payment and then by or two is sell the car\nGet a babysitter\nAnd use the money that you would have paid on the car is your down payment and pay off a student loan\nEither one's fine with me I'm the cars not that abusive it's just it's just the large lion's share of the problem right so the you know what kind of car is it\nIt's a twenty six teams so they mailed you like it a lot of it okay All right well I mean do you want to rent for a year in order to keep it all I'm ruins emails so sold my condo and I'm renting now you know I mean what else are you home kinds are OK with her\nOkay so if you just you know write a check can be dead free today and then pilot money really really really aggressively for a year and you've got your down payment right\nYeah and that's you know what that's what we're doing but uh that while you're moving into the home with your emergency fund in place um and your debt free which is how we always tell you to buy a house I'm open you know sometimes we you know where you're selling and buying you have to do it a little differently but in your case it's kind of cut and dried isn't it\nYeah it's pretty simple pretty simple analysis you're either going to sell the car and buy a house now or you're going to keep the car and buy a house next year so many in a year or Eighteen months or something like that how long you want to save up to do that and I I think that's what I Would do probably in your situation\nUm but yeah I think it is Karen is with us in Miami I Karen how are you\nI'm fine how are you better than I deserve what's up I'm low\nOr you know my mom lost her job in March and um everything she hasn't been able to find work and I've been really worried for her you know and along with that um her not having that much money she's not really frugal with money when she actually done it\nOnly we're proud of what we have one last one I ever talk therapy ... ban on our house mhm we probably the biggest that we put all\nThat we've had our emergency finally started finding retirement and we have time girls that are nine years old and we didn't know if we had part I'm In their college fund or if we could pay off\nOn the other congressmen on the house or the ... on\nHow much is that the ... on or about thirty five and so we use it all up it was like oh wow okay and what your interest rate on your home or on how\nTo shoot about market there and you are a hundred percent sure that thirty thousand dollars will cause the amount of be dropped\nWe populated out it'll be like thirty one valve and we have we have the money to their ...\nYeah and you can argue confirming that with the mortgage company prior to doing it obviously you're not going to send them the money\nBut they only want to make sure that the ... going away okay and the amount of costing you watch\nUh the dollars and probably put him on them and only a hundred and Ninety nine dollar the\n\nHousehold income or around roughly put a hundred thousand\nOkay here here's what here's where you are in our baby steps and you probably already know this but let's review so our other listeners are caught up you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement orange you\nCorrect yes baby step for five is kids college and six by all files are like so really the question is are we gonna put this on five or ... there's not there's not a dumb or wrong answer here either one is fine whatever makes you feel good whatever's good idea\nI'm I'm probably going to take twenty thousand of this and put ten eight and five twenty nuns for these girls\nCome you're getting your college sneaking up on you fast\nAnimals for all the other ten at the house um and then I'm gonna system and then I'm going to set up a monthly amount to add to the ten beginning at the first of the year so that they ... are kind of on auto pilot and so you're going to put you know ten thousand and plus a hundred bucks a month each or something like that while the Michael\nEm but behind them and I do want to own your own as well\nAnd then you know then we can just spread it around but however you want to do it but some but yeah I Want to put a substantial amount towards college and then you make enough to be able to just beat on this mortgage pretty rapidly but\nSix hundred dollar a year or return on a thirty one thousand dollar investment is not that great\nBut you know so I'm going to start the kids' college and then I'm going to just start paying off the house the natural result of working your baby steps Sixers you're going to get down below

remember a high note coming to the mid west and talking about swamp gas by him in the haunted him after he said that\nDidn't have or dead but but he began to change his his his mind taking more ... particularly after a ... a shock poll a I spent a full day what Heineken jak fillet at the Northwestern University in Nineteen Nineteen sixty nine\nAnd ... and by then a high and they had already decided that indeed the UFO question needed a serious scientific investigation and and ... and he was no longer I'm going to pooh pooh it as something uh you know\nWhat was it didn't change them Gordon just because something dramatic cap into more he went from being the project Blue Book consultant which was basically deny deny deny Lou all of a sudden a staunch believer\nIn UFOs even having his own organization out of Chicago uh-huh\nI mean what what was that trigger points for him that got ... I always heard it was the ... the police officer on a ...\nA great case they really did April twenty fourth Nineteen sixty four ... did a thorough investigation ... case where this police officer saw\nA um a landed craft with I think it was three occupants outside a little ma'am\nAnytime there was a you know flipped over car when he was driving directive only got there and went oh my God\nThat's right that's ... that's correct and and uh\nUh and then I think\nTook off over a dynamite check just missing it by inches and and and throw away and and and a highly was quite impressed by that by that case I think that may have been one case that\nUh that started them thinking that um maybe he should versus science took a couple more years to do it but I think maybe a shock plane had something to do with it too because uh the shock and and I'm Alan Hi Nick or a\n... a a hunting was a ... Jacques um mentors yeah that came up very close friend and a course his his book was published I think it was last year wasn't at twenty two\nAbout the uh the hunting biography and somebody actually in England now\nThat would be super I Know you should be quoted in that part because you were there\nTo make the world the I'm I'm In touch with her so cool I think I Will\nDo you think the media today is different from the media back in the sixties because it's my feeling Gordon that the media in the sixties really seem to be interested in us all cases in talking huh and took it seriously\nI mean Mike Wallace when he was on ABC in Nineteen fifty eight\nHe was interested he interviewed keyhole but they're all they're always seem to be censorship going on there but\nI Know well I I can tell you back and uh and the sixty seven are doing the flash sixty six sixty seven the media\nI mean I was up some time 'til two o'clock in the morning and night cap course wash the sea\nFielding calls from is far away as Australia while and uh Germany and I was on a ... a a speaking radio program and journey to in Germany at two o'clock in the morning and the mail man would bring in twice a day huge sex all the letters\nSo they had ... and ... and there were these huge flaps he saw them in almost every newspaper that doesn't happen much anymore\nWhere would you been in Nineteen Seventy one\n\nIn Nineteen Seventy one I was um and because the Maryland and that's why you're talking about McDonnell now right\nWe were you were you interested in UFOs and things like that then\nOf course as a matter of fact a a Jim McDonnell was on her home he's he spent a course you know what I'm saying is they McDonnell was the number one I'm advocate matter of fact he tried so hard to get time to change his mind\nAt age ... down on on next desk\nAnd and said that Hi Nicolas ... was a\nShould've come out and uh for a serious investigation but but anyhow Hi Nick you may recall if you've read and drill holes excellent\nBook knowing that are on the program yeah I'm Still in contact with her although she is Ninety two now I Know it isn't it amazing GMO and strong she's or the writing our own

polar a depression type of things\nNot the Ninety\nHated more than any other scientists back then the ring this subject\nHe really did he was a great story for us to\nA show or was he was a ... a great friend of tech laid the call and myself and my wife\nWhen I was Twenty one in Detroit or as a radio reporter my first interview was would stance in Friedman\nIs in he's still he's still going strong you slowed down a little bit but he says that the\nWhite told me about two months ago that he was gonna retire when he wished eighty five I say ones that go to the base than he says oh what a

plan it's being visited or not\nMy gut tells me after doing all the research writing this book reading mysteries of the skies measures of the guys was the first book ever written in Nineteen sixty eight that went back I'm beyond that went back before the cannot Arnold\nHa ha\nThey see and town of ships are wailing shipped captains log that actually described in his own handwriting a desk like came out of this guy went down into the water\nCame back up again and then circled the ship and then that off at a tremendous and and this was like in Eighteen forty eight or something like that at all and there was another case that I found also in the national archives\nIn the seventeenth century where I'm a some men were rafting a a a\n... or trying to paddle a raft down the muddy river\nAh in in Massachusetts when they saw this huge addicts this that came out of the sky I started drawing the raft up\nRiver against it and then it ... it lifted up out of the air for a little bit plopped it back down into the water and took off disappear how could it have a lot of those things and and a lot of that was um in my book masters of the skies UFOs in perspective\nYou know people like John

beyond the earth his website is his name and it's linked up the coast to coast am dot com some of these cases in your book Gordon just bring back just amazing memories\nOr I just remember how excited I was every time I'd read a brand new UFO story and just looking at them and flying saucers from beyond the earth to recollect all these all these stories all over again they're amazing\nYeah yeah well I I kept some good filed which I I took over three years and I've been I've been wanting for at least the last ten years to do this book and finally got around to it and hopefully it's my uh it may be on the phone but I think I Am\nDo you think the government really has not just what's going on why don't they tell us\nWhy things they're coming close with this latest program out with the Pentagon and I think it's the closest I've ever come but um I have a theory and it it it it may sound kind of\nA court case but uh I think that we have known all along where these uh uh saucers come from and that we've been actually exchanging perhaps technologies what's the name\nIt it sounds like a far out thing it's not something ... would approve of it in his heyday\nA matter of fact I was little reluctant to put out any of the occupation reports until I wrote the book strange effects from your father was in Nineteen sixty nine which was really a night cap publication but for the first time we got into the the occupation cases and uh\nAnd and and things like that but of course ... main focus was to get to ... hearings he managed to do it twice and Nineteen sixty six Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd he has some great hopes for the University of Colorado a UFO project where in fact I call my chapter on that liar liar pants on fire the University of Colorado UFO product project\nBecause we are just symptom a disagreement deserve our I'm\nOut of some of our best cases\nAnd I'm In the long run they just almost completely ignored them\nI remember when the ... report came out and kind of pooh poohed UFOs\nThat was January of Nineteen sixty nine wreck and from that time on all the funding for a night cap went out and then\nA\nA a there was not kept staff member who was also at the CIA connections and\nI think the CIA had been trying to take it over a for some time of course Roscoe, Illinois quarter who was the first chairman of the night cap board after kill took over a was the first director of the CIA\n[laughter] yeah yeah what do you see the sea I wanted to do that I can just wash it\n[noise] well I think that's part of it but at the same time I think they wanted to keep that going as long as they had control over it\nAnd um but ... didn't believe that even the call and believe that I Try to persuade him that\nThere was a a staff member named Stuart Nixon who had a who had the practically admitted to me that he was a CIA plant and but the date for some reason didn't want to believe it\nUm which which struck me kind of\nI'm off balance because ah actually that was the one that\nBefore I ever came on board I think it was sixty four maybe sixty three were to CIA agents came into the office and they went through and I kept files of thoroughly over a period of several hours and\nUm so I think they knew all along at the\nYou know but they have a certain amount of control over it but uh and and kill\n'em\nI don't know I I just don't know how much can you really knew I really believe that it was a CIA took I think he believed the CIA was willing\nTo let my cap continue um\nAs long as they to monitor\nAs long as they could monitor or right and I I think he was shocked to as I was\nNineteen sixty nine\nWho fired you are but um\nI think it was a Jews Brian he was a CIA contact the did you and I'm like I'm a ... seed CIA\nMember and the ... and and uh and Colonel Brian um\nAnd also do it for an a and a\nAnd it was hard ... see a connection to store next and it was the the the um plant in the office had CIA connections and uh I think they were just trying to see how they could eventually take it over and not make it look like it was a CIA takeover\nI mean was an independent private the organization it\nWas supposed to be yeah exactly\nWho do who who who had the authority to let you go and kill too you said\nThat's correct he who's the founder\nYeah I Know but but the thing is that the we had a board of governors\nAnd I'm In early sixty nine they appointed a keen how the president or not he was the director first they opponent and the president and they appointed me the vice president because they call at that time had left and taken a more lucrative position\nAnd uh uh but and by the end of last year it took less than a year for them to a closed down media organization but I think they had been a\nA a a\nReally monitoring off all along for we haven't even thought the Airforce and one or a key oh and I were on the phone and I can't live with the hundred miles south of Washington DC he wasn't on the office and all that often maybe once every two months or so [noise]\nUh and we were talking about a UFO case and when all of a sudden we got to click on the phone and we heard a voice has said well major what now law this is Don King who is of course had for quite know was the air force spokesman at\nThe time\nAnd then we have another ... a situation where he wanted a to ask me if I were joined with him and creating a totally false case\nAnd that happened to be a ... and so we created a case where you live oh had landed but there were occupancy and there were special effects ... electromagnetic effects aliens walking around and they actually showed up a a and one of the project boo both reports\nAnd of course back in sixty eight sixty nine I think it was we publish the ah project grudge and Blue Book or so it was the first time we were able to get those reports shaken loose from uh the Airforce or through the freedom of Information Act\nMore than ... did you ever know a ... in the late Apollo fourteen astronaut gr Mitchell\nSo no I didn't know I'm a director I Know of him of course but he had a UFOs fighting I Know\nWe are we knew him and he was a staunch believer in UFOs\nThat's what I understand knowledge was\nUm again when I was Twenty one years old I interviewed Dr Benjamin Simon if you recall that name\nI'd do better than Barney hell that psychiatrists the attorney I tried\nThe hypnotized them and that was the case and I have um investigative finally hit they had a huge trial on it but here again it was another case a key who didn't want to get out because he he\nHe you know he was trying to persuade Congress to hold hearings\nFrom Facebook MBBS painting Montgomery\nWhich I\nThink you're really\n\nGoing to turn a guy by tearing the\nMan I came in Maine and by then and now there's no\nDoubt about that day and that may be the right thing\nTo child was done by the time\nNo no\nTeacher and\n\n\nShe\nHad to say well do\nYou guys out to LA and then and then they miss any way

the secretary of state\nCan you imagine the consequences of what she did can you imagine the consequences of setting conservatism back a generation and a half\n... of allowing Republicans to get absolutely Ronald in the midterms because people are deflated and think what the hell's the point we give them a majority and I can't even get a guy on the Supreme Court\n\nCan you imagine the consequences just think about the president she said\nAny other special election if your guys not winning just move the goalposts moved the election of six months if you can move it forward you can move it back right right or or figure out who qualifies set it set at six months from now and if you need your guide to getting quickly just moving up to six weeks from now\nIt's total chaos just paying pneumonia Kay Ivey\nMay ruin it conservative movements singlehandedly\nAnd let me tell you I Am going to be so\nAlmost set an ugly two syllable word passed\nIf this vote fails I'm going to be angry with the Alabama voters Republican voters I Hope you feel really good about yourself suburban middle class voters in the fertile crescent around Birmingham who cost the Republicans this seat out you really feel good about yourself Kay Ivey\nLiberal Democrat like Walt Maddox in charge of Alabama's cut out of the same cloth as Doug Jones automatic says Doug Jones to point out I mean if you're K ivy you you point that Doug Jones this is why we can't have nice things in Alabama this is why we can't have Democrats elected in Alabama look what he's doing it when it matters when the chips are down that you can't be trusted\nThey can't be trusted\nHe's basically Doug Jones was a personality hello Atlantic ... he don't even have that great of a personality\nMeaning the nice guy but he's friendly Doug is just not friendly\nBut this is ... ... if you can see this is how you campaign noticed knew know decay ivy run your commercial right now with Doug Jones and Walt Maddox together\nAnd tell people won't Maddox is Doug Jones two point oh eight liberal on adults righted never Trump or liberal\nIn sheep's clothing trying to look like a moderate conservative\nSomeone ask Doug Jones was telling me someone asked last Maddox if he was in the United States Senate with Walt Maddox vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh and don't let them squeeze out of it by saying I and I think I haven't really looked at the whole record\nI haven't seen all the evidence I'm been campaigning I haven't really been paying attention to that no sir the chips are on the table how do you vote\nBecause one day you might have to appoint a successor to a senator just like Kay Ivey did\nOr just like Robert Bentley did read one day you might have to do that\nAnd we need to know what your philosophy is and this is a perfect time to test it a perfect time to test\n\nSo let us know let us know and if I'm Kay Ivey\n\nThat's how I approach I Am I frustrated with Kay Ivey for moving the election you're damn right I Am it may cost us a Supreme Court justice but putting putting in Walt Maddox two point oh\nIs not going to fix\nRumor is he visited a mosque and put a picture of it on Facebook\nYeah in front of a care banter Council on American Islamic Relations funded by terrorist groups\n\nI mean that that's that's what we're dealing with here that's Doug Jones pro Islamic terrorist anti Brett Kavanaugh never Trump her\nThat that is Doug Jones in a nutshell I mean they they ... the twenty twenty campaign writes itself the guy has totally destroyed his chance of getting election el elected by bucking Brett\nKavanaugh and he got to be in some kind of a liberal bubble these liberals get in a bubble and they don't realize they're killing their chance of getting elected Claire McCaskill now has\nAfter the vote ... if you only look at polls taken after the Brett Kavanaugh thing blew up Claire McCaskill is now losing by two in Missouri Menendez has only up by two in New Jersey over an unnamed Republican nobody's ever heard of\nWhile he was alleged by the Dominican government to be having sex with underage prostitutes while he was there\n[noise] oh [noise] how can you not right at ... I mean there's no this is the art of the hit these dead there's nobody right hit pieces anymore you require local talk radio to hit Doug Jones in and Walt Maddox for you is that is that where we are as in Alabama and\nWho is this other guy that song was on the committee up very partisan Democrat or a male what's his name but all of them I Know but\nHe was pretty outspoken a Blumenthal yeah yeah yeah but I don't know about women don't get a lot about serving in Vietnam um met his Fifteen year old wife when he was thirty one\nNo way to look him up look him up you are kidding I'm not kidding he's Roy Moore to find yeah yeah absolutely he was thirty one she was Fifteen they play tennis together took her to a party and I got married lighter\nMhm yeah look it up mhm\nUnbelievable Jake and he lied about serving in Vietnam a lot of knowledge well now we know why his wife didn't know where he was one who served in Vietnam she was in diapers [laughter] quite literally I mean he would have been what Eighteen Thirteen Years really should've been to\nShe'd well he ... he was thirty one but she was Fifteen\nI Know that's what I'm saying that but when he was Eighteen in the military she'd been to run her running around in a robbery with diamonds on\nAnd that's precisely ladies why you need to throw every romp in your closet or cause city 'cause a a\nSenator Blumenthal his wife was in Iran for when he was supposedly have a lot about it\nAnd he lied about a Democrat there's such a double standard case Alison right now they're you know the ... I heard the argument the other day on television you know why they're saying Keith Ellison shouldn't have to step down from the DNC chair I'm I kid you not I'm about to tell you something because there's no corroborating evidence to support the\nClaims against him I Swear to God that's what they said on television that's what they said on television\nThere was a liberal up there and they said what about the comparisons with Keith ... Keith Ellison he's got some pretty pretty gnarly accusations against him a picture of his girlfriend looking beat up floating around on the Internet what about those\nAnd this woman said there is no corroborating evidence that he didn't call the police no she actually did call the police are nine one one call there's actual corroborating evidence but in their mind and the Democrat bubble they can do no wrong this is this is George Orwell run amok\nFishes George Orwell run amok insane these people are not when I say and I've been saying that for four and a half years on these are what liberalism is an absolute mental\nDisorder is a it is is they threw in through mental disorder\nIn order to be a liberal the cognitive dissonance you have to maintain in your mind at all times is ... it's too much the average mind would buckle and become a conservative\nIt's just one\nBut the Emmy normal mind\n[laughter] heavy having someone as having a normal [laughter]\nThank you I or [noise]\nOr [noise]\nOr number seven to nine to drive forty seven minutes that's I'm not calling you I I was going to hand I was referencing the things that you didn't call me an e guard have to correct you but it's I thought they told me they were your name was they\nEvents live at home movies [laughter]\nWe talk like that is\nEvidence there will\n\n\n\n\nKnow whether you know whether you're going to work or coming home and it always bear warnings districts do mine and I have three children only an insult Ninety three point wanted them to a CD\nAuto so darn automotive was your local trusted source retires an auto repair in the river region we do it all from all changes to your insurance mission even knows Boesky chickens and laws we also ... brands retires all diminished process will stores located improbable Montgomery which are good for your convenience\nWe can also be your ... your ah element wigs and more\nWe also accept your birds don't Firestone and ... year one credit card check out our website also started a new model so darn automotive come to wear your auto saves you\nCBS tonight is action packed the new season of MCI you continue to get a dead body with an episode that just funny some echinacea or the most disgusting find an empty I Am history you're getting good men from the executive producer of law and order becomes the new grown but\nTake them out for you I was like a new episode of MCI us New Orleans CBS tonight\nIn\nTry and she'd Kim where he was with Alabama home mortgage and where we make mortgages easy if your finances are haunting you each time to call\nMortgage stylistic seven forty three that stopped six seven forty three\nI told you that the money they looking for all the time it in your home is there's no trick by reading your mortgage you might be eligible to lower your interest rate or eliminate monthly mortgage insurance would\nPer year or more to refinance may be the answer what are you waiting for\nPayment make huge screen name to\nEvent yeah you'd never style [laughter]\nMaster control centers this is W.

was a time when British people mattered there was a time when the United kingdom was a player in was not totally irrelevant on the global stage that time has passed that sounds good but are still going to go see Tony Blair\nThe age of the United states when that wasn't a popular position he did and it may cost him his career\nWell at a there's a movie out called the queen I think other all day

all is a British you mean by saving their asked twice in the last hundred years [laughter]\nThat's what I saw it had ... and yeah [laughter] yeah I think they sort of oh this is the fact that they even exists it that we let them keep a little island up in the north Atlantic I mean and we came to their aid on the Falklands two we did say couldn't even beat Argentina without us\nI mean that that that's that's something that we do owe them a great deal of gratitude to the British people that one thing for this world that was worth while that was good\nThey exported their language and their

I don't want us to get myself to that kind of situation and you say it doesn't happen all the local level I'm Sorry they're a lot of mean spirited people out there that they want to be the naysayers and\nThey want to punish should penalize anybody that wants to say hey I'm willing to put myself\nIn our wife a public service and it's not necessarily about the person it's about the family can you imagine what those two kids and what that wife has been through a man of the hill that they've been through that you can say the same thing on those that are accused of but\nThat's the reason that good people say why do I want to get into politics and you feel like your family's been subjected to some of that are in the last election year is very much so because it got very personal uh and my family got very very upset about it\nUm what what did they say it will take me through some of the Congress that not not blow by blow nothing personal obviously but what what is sort of the tone and ten or the conversations around home when it's happening\nWhen you accuse ... case the husband the father of some\nOf the things that they accused me of\nIt directly bears upon the family and some from that standpoint you know what are they going to be able to say sip put your arms around you and say hey you know dad or or whatever of you know we know it's not true of many things that the ... of\nDoing business for friends\nAnd play just just the allegations that we don't care about human rights we don't care about the black people on the west side all we want to do is take care of the east side in France is just not right\nBut those are the kinds of statements when you when you're an incumbent in my case when you're an incumbent all they can talk about is what's wrong with the city of my gummy I'm a half full glass or a cat a guy\nWe are more right than we've got wrong in my ... does that mean we don't have an issue that we have to deal with we certainly do some hiking control and some of my ...\nSo from that standpoint what politics ought to be about is the art of compromise let's get around the table and try to figure out what we can do politics should be the art of the possible not the art of the negative\nThat was actually beautiful because I Know the the ... and ... and and working in politics jak and I sometimes have to do the things that hurt people like you say\nYou develop and campaign as well like you know we try to be honest about it when when you're running is some of the record I think their record is fair game yeah now whether they had a bankruptcy or divorce Santa going to do that yeah that's that's off the table I mean what is Iran against the guy and we ran against an incumbent\nWho was who outspent our guy probably eight to one who had three really messy divorces or had been fired from a job\nWe didn't bring any of that uh we beat the hell out of my income and Gore\nAnd his slaves ... votes for common Gore and we beat them\nWith like Seventy grand and he spent four or five hundred grand and and every Republican in the state door knocking forum and noting adventure for 'em and everything else and we beat 'em on an issue totally unrelated to his personal failings I Would never even brought him up but unfortunately negative ads work\nYeah and we could have we could have done negative ads and all that other stuff but we didn't\nSo what's your what's your take on a a Walt Maddox and and a governor arrive in that are not debating uh everybody tells me I shouldn't have debated you know three three years while it's just that Judah\nWas on the novel that Shakespeare yeah we have four or five I wouldn't call them debates there was just you and I kind of kind of stuff you know you can get a hold on\nCan I can I ask because one of my favorite moments in political history happened at Shakespeare festival when you guys around ...\nOr ... whatever her name was you know what I'm Talking about yeah if you were yelling at night is the only thing I remember she came out and it's like two weeks before the election and they asked her do you have a plan to address inequality Montgomery whatever she goes I have a plan it is a seven step plan\nBut I'm not ready to tell you guys get what's in it [laughter]\nAnd I looked at my left and I looked at I write about elections to [laughter] when are you going to get around to get into it seems like it'd be a critical moment to uh go ahead and I got under ... is that had like\nAn eight point playing with their only six of them I don't know what happened to you and everybody just savaged him for it I Can't remember who it was this whole area as\nWell see if we had political consultants like you guys politics wouldn't be the art of the many blood suckers politics you know yeah yeah many but soccer is no doubt about it a long way it's kind of interesting I get a few calls now are about to inquire as to you know what's it like to be the mayor\nOh we need is somebody that doesn't want to position but most of the job ... Campbell for the right reasons yeah\nGo but not the ... and but the one ... diet that grim grocery store a liquor store still looked like you know do some work ... ... ... ... ... business Randall\nWell I mean but you got to have some kind of courage critique you can't have it looked like it was ... junkie but anyway\nWhich one you're talking about the gum showed a liquor store to store does your Georgia's or Georgia spice it ...\nIs that I thought that was really good matter of fact I knew side was put on their bat or I guess it's been seven years ago but a George ... that you tell him that you're not going to go shopping you mean more if you don't do so high dollar\nQuestion the question I got married because it is for six or eight grand because department where ... where the section eight houses like apartments or whatever\nWho they thought that would be housing authority\nOkay so that comes from the government initially\nLA so you know government housing and origami housing authority through crying out loud and even\nThough I had a plan dollar forty broke\nThank you appreciate your comment I I just by the way for ... um I saw bomb under the interstate the other day tell me up top well man on an street yeah back in the other thing was over in Milan and now they moved\nTo LA and Matt do COO over there on a Saturday morning and basically help them move\nMatch

herself yeah but\nAt least they're not actually the interstate it is a challenge you know I Know I Know\n... you're on the air the mayor\nI mourn gentleman a Jack was it uh was it Rick Perry and his list those three things that you're thinking of a minute ago\nNo one rink but I Do remember that when the uh he was talking about the three departments there should be abolished I think yeah and and one of them yeah he's head of energy you know the the\nUm the mayor mayor and I'm I'm going to be very brief in er and leave it to people who have questions for you I'm just a cold as someone who can't vote for you because uh I don't live in Montgomery\nA as a tomorrow I have worked here twenty four years I think you do a buying a job I see improvements all the time\nBut uh it wasn't until just recently that I had occasion to attend several a city council meetings\nAnd my eyes were really opened and kudos to you for the uh the great class and grace you show in taking the abuse she receives especially at the end of those meetings\nAre using your councilman general I get called every name in the book yeah and it's a shame but you handle it extremely well and I've been very impressed I told you that privately after one of their ... and I wanted to be sure and just uh say that publicly\nWell I appreciate it comes to enjoy but if we get more people like you come in and crowded out all the rest of the bone gum if we we love that but uh yeah it is a time for those citizens that want to come and voice their concerns unfortunately some of the issues they talk about our just factually incorrect\nOf or different spin a but uh they say right and uh they get three minutes to do that but I appreciate your comment um they're they're very helpful because sometimes it is very difficult just to keep your mouth shut I'm getting a\nText from a big wig how big the big wigs pretty big telling me that they may be something a foot at Honda you heard anything of course he has\nFaced tells me you've heard when I\nWas three hundred and eighty million dollar expansion now underway right now\nBecause it's a developing a new a new engine um for their product in North America\nSo that's in process right now are bent in process now for about three or four much but my statement is the same as it's always been when NFL Sunday is ready to make any investment decisions were ready willing and able to support them\nJohn you're on the ... the mayor\nFirst when I got a question um I\nActually actually observation there was a string runs behind Alabama State by the softball baseball and football spy on earth is lying about\nTheir policy you know a a legit session ball out into the street a tree bushes everything and it's turned into a one way or the other way\nThat actually that that they are so I Would just reported it to the state or is there\nIt's the traffic has er that's my question was I think he's got a great\nYou can and um will will ride by they we got to go back into town or I\nMy first instinct would be that perhaps if nothing's been done on private property but we will check that and make sure if it's on public property get it done of his own ... that's ... that's what I'm saying\nA state agency or state entity like that you could find them but they'll never have right there you know you're not going the board and when we put the people that we've noticed and we've gone out and debated and things like that state of Alabama will be a a pretty prevalent name up there because they have so much tax only so many tax liens\nOur number seven to nine to to a to seven to nine to to run you're on the air with maritime strange\nHey man worn a compliment are you on the air\nOn our police fire and rescue folks I live in a garden on subdivision here in Montgomery and the police department a couple of weeks ago handle a or no noise ordinance issue that we\nHave in our problem once and they nip it in the boat and the police officers were against squared away professional and informative and proud to be police officers you could tell well I appreciate hearing that\nAnd ah we have a lot of senior residence and our subdivision and the fire and rescue folks from time to time come to our subdivision and they're just totally a hundred percent response to isn't courteous and\nAnd all the shooting the problem but we're uh we're lucky to have a good progressive fire and police rescue a well comments I really appreciate\nYou saying that this ... this noise ordinances difficult because you have to experience it by the police officer a rest and can't come and say is noisy or whatever and then we get there and it's not you can't really do anything maybe go visit with them but if in fact\nWe can be there when the noise or is being ordinance has been violated then we can in fact do something I'm delighted to hear about that I Will be using it as an example of how you try to do a things to make our citizens last better\nI'll say this or working in a blue water we have to pick up some fair shifts 'cause we help sponsor the affair and it's a pleasure to that was fun to get up to me that we get to make listeners and I have a good time we have some games out there\nThe police have been unbelievably friendly smiling all over the place it's hot yep there in dark uniforms walking up and down and they don't get it puts shorts on and tank tops in mill around like everybody else does\nThat they've done it with professionalism in class and a smile or have stopped by the boost several of them and and

phone calls he helped raise you didn't make him away from where you are oh\nRight [laughter] and he spent a lot of time here and his daughter a burden\nWere roommates I'm In college and smoke to\nNo kidding about a nosy now learning more and more but this story yeah we were\nKids can't grade really absolutely about the ... billion best absolutely not absolutely no doubt about it not as often as I'd like yeah well that's part of the big moment she's always they're really absolutely I don't really have I don't really get college credit\nYeah heck yeah people you still keep in touch with us\nI don't know see I mean I like the people I went to college with are great people are not yeah they made a big impact on your own you know keep in touch with the most stills was going on in the world a mortgage business because the economy is absolutely ... you know just thrashing about is doing is absolutely\nMortgage business I tell ya ... businesses really picked up August was always a is always a a slower time that's what I take my vacation and\nWith my daughter and all that good stuff but uh\nThen you irrelevant to September and October everybody's back to school you know uh if you if you've moved over the summer you're already moved in\nAnd so purchases and refinance says are are doing really well which brings to mind you know I don't know if it was recent or if they've come out recently or if it's been out there and just a lot of people are acting on it but um we've had several several um\nHomeowners give us a call who have properties up on like Martin and Alabama Power has offered to sell the property instead of them leasing it as you know ... properties leashed say the power company and they've offered them um the ability to buy it\nAnd we've we've we've generated done handled about three of those ... is this a new program to him\nNow that if I was always done\nNo they haven't always done it I mean the properties uh originally was least yeah hundred year lease or what I mean on nearly so there you go\nAnd Alabama Power has sent letters out to um the the people who own property up there and offered them the ability to buy it so you know the first first place I they call\nIt Alabama home mortgage looking into cannot do it how do I do it um\nYou know what my new payment and most often the payments are are are lessen their pain now no doubt about it no doubt about it because they've on that property for a while right and as you all know the values at like Martin has\nI Want to get off for for just a moment Brett Kavanaugh and had to a couple of the pieces that are just getting absolutely\nWay late by the news cycle a butter absolutely dynamite stories you really need to ah really need to pay attention to one is as evidence that the economy is just absolutely kicking butt and taking names Amazon has up their minimum wages they pay their workers to Fifteen\nDollars an hour that is up from a about fifty percent and they were just around ten dollars I guess because Amazon owns whole foods maybe they'll dump all those people have Fifteen to I don't know how that works but\nUh so that's something to keep an eye on this is just evidence that even though Jeff Bezos hates Donald Trump's guts and it's never dropper and a global is in the corporate isn't and and hates Donald Trump's policies he still benefitting from the that's the thing about conservatism conservatism benefits liberals and uh but liberalism doesn't benefit conservatives\nI might just a fact\nConservative policies make everybody richer conservatives and liberals like the rain will fall on everybody the poor the evil the rich the good it doesn't matter\nThe rising tide lifts all boats do even an evil\nSOB like Jeff Bezos who's Washington Post absolutely obliterate Donald Trump on a daily basis is benefiting from this and his workers are benefiting from many of whom probably voted against Donald Trump\nSo that is one piece of news that uh I wanted to get out there um mostly due to the ... when ... meeting\nWith a rose rather than it has not been ... yet I don't believe okay I don't believe it's been ... yet that is uh [noise] that is a\nStill out there still out there we'll get back to that when they do say that 'cause there's a lot to talk about on that I mentioned the NAFTA loophole to got closed during the discussion with the mayor if you weren't here during the ten o'clock hour if you ever want to know\nIt was so critical Donald Trump had to be elected prison United States beginning in the late Nineteen eighties and continuing until twenty sixteen early early twenties Seventeen with Donald Trump took over\n\nAmerica was absolutely getting raided getting rated the for the last rate on American soil Santa Ana last foreign rate on American soil as Santa Ana back in the early Nineteen hundreds\nThe the the last domestic raid on America was NAFTA\nTerrible trade deals by people like George H W. Bush George W. Bush Bill Clinton and Barack Obama for the worst presidents to ever occupy the White House\nJust terrible terrible human beings generally uh and and worst presidents\nDonald Trump got in there and it's completely rework the trade deal with the United states Mexico and Canada NAFTA is dead\nNAFTA is dead I told you a year year and a half ago that was Donald Trump's number one priority was getting NAFTA reworked it is now done it took less than two years the NAFTA deal that took probably ten years to put together\nTook him less than two years it completely tear it down and create a deal that's going to help the American worker or one of them the biggest deal see here is the biggest problem with NAFTA\nThe agreed to basically free trade across borders except in a couple of industries Canada wanted to protect their dairy industry they didn't want American dairy coming across they didn't want American telecom companies coming across they didn't want American banks coming across they push hugely protection as measures on those three industries in particular other industries as well but those three in particular\nOther than that it was basically come as you are you know your trucks can come across you can truck in the United states same thing with Mexico you can bring your good then you can take your goods out that's fine and in theory\nThat is\nA decent way to do business with your neighbors goods in goods out the problem is\nThat the United states was getting raped I mean absolutely raped and pillaged by countries like China and and other Southeast Asian countries in particular but countries up and down the Central American court or in the south America\nBy\nMexico and Canada allowing people to dump their goods in Canada and Mexico\nDo one little final touch to maybe even just package it say it was made in Mexico and Senate across the border duty free\nAnd they were allowing it to do to do it on things like our commodities industries food metals\nStaples things that we need in order to produce a great military a great citizenry happy healthy fats citizenry trust me we succeeded [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nBut what they would do is they would they would use Mexico was a staging they're primarily Mexico the candidate would do it too they would use them as a staging ground\nWe would have to deal with Canada anything made in Canada could come across duty free\nAnd so Canada would\nEr tariff free or low low super low to Canada would allow in Mexico would allow good to be mostly assembled overseas shipped over to Mexico\nAnd if you would have paid on a billion dollars worth of products two hundred million dollars in tariffs to do business with the United states Mexico can then take a hundred million from you and ship it across the border for free\nAnd you just saved as a as a producer a hundred million dollars on a billion dollars worth of goods basically ten percent you're basically cut your ... and a half and the reality was they were taken leaner and leaner cuts\nAnd the result was the American\nManufacturing industry was just totally annihilated and destroyed the farming industry to some extent totally annihilated industrial\n\nThat's the reality\n\nAnd that is what Donald Trump wanted to correct because he knew that the average American worker was just getting way laid by these policies and so what they've done is they've restructured key parts of the trade agreement and they understand\nThat Mexico and Canada have a unique access to the U.S market because of this trade agreement\nAs to what Donald Trump did was he closed the big NAFTA loophole\nIn order for China or any other Asian country in order for a Central American or South American country to get goods into the United states now through Mexico and Canada\n\nUnited States will now have a veto over any trade agreements between Canada and the rest of the world and between Mexico and the rest of the world or any individual country they can come up with a trade agreement that they have to submit it to the United states in the United states gets to you\n... where are the rubber meets the road here's where we get a test the metal\n\nDonald Trump will not be part of the United states for the forever at some point he has to go constitution limits into three to two terms rather I Wish we could get that revoked the constitution limits into two terms\nAt some point a Democrat or a global is\nErnest apples met Republican or global is what I repeat myself there's no difference among them will become president United States and have control over the trade agreements\nAnd one day the president will either the future global as president who either realized the good\nThat this is doing\nAnd keep the agreements in place because he or she wants the United states to be ... great global power he or she wants to the United states citizens to be nice and wealthy\nDad access to the\nFiner amenities in life\nTo have opportunities to start their own business pass on wealth from generation to generation to be charitable friends family and the less fortunate\nOr that President will do what the last four terrible lose their presidents have done George W. Bush Bill Clinton but George W. Bush and Barack Obama which is totally got the American people again Donald Trump has given us a reprieve Donald Trump has given us a chance to keep wealth in the United states for at least the next six years while he's\nPresident United States at least six years Donald Trump has given us that opportunity we will need to keep watchful eyes a watchful eye\nOn the next president of the United states ... Mike Pence or anyone else and if you get one of these global is in there\n\nIf you get one of these Democrats in there just to understand that they don't like you they don't want you to be wealthy they don't want you to have access to a finer life and well that you can pass on\nThey\nWant you to be poor and dependent on government\nAnd they want that donors who make money off of actual trading your wealth out of the United states in other countries they want their donors would be very happy\nAnd Donald Trump right now is making a very sad [noise] which is why they're going after him so much jackets half past eleven o'clock I Can't believe it [noise]\nAnd then when you want to go out and bought you went from employing about twenty four percent of your town's population to about three percent four percent\nExactly and and we wish you know we import products now we had no choice I'm\nYou know you can't be competitive without doing it and so that people are getting back into the people who are getting paid to build brooms or no longer residence we haven't ... really haven't made him\nRoom there and then we still make moms but we haven't made up for him there and years yeah\nAh we've got the equipment but that industry has gone in the United states it is completely gone ... people that do it and they're an abomination their garages or their staples or whatever but I mean that that's it the industry so last manufacturer foreigners posed about\nMaking brings excuse me about three years ago we we put about five\nAnd what they do is now you just important to brooms back in from from where\nMexico\nAnd and do the total cost of a broom has gone down for you to produce I mean for you to to sell\nNo they'll Costa brings continue to go up even even though a they're a from Mexico what did it and that's the price of blames never ever went down because a map\nSo why did why why why out sourcing to Mexico why why not make them here is the price goes up\nAll my cost went down but it could have caused specific consent or continue to go up I mean my costs went up to\nBut we all\nThe straws grown in Mexico and it it doesn't ruin this climate and um it's a very labor intensive process that takes three months to learn how to make\nA a low in Britain and it takes a year to learn how to make a commercial ... so the skills that is going on I mean it it would be it\nEven bring back if you had to\nI couldn't bring it back at the ... went back to thirty two percent where it was or a hundred years\nSo we went from thirty to present a zero percent right yes yeah and it but it's phased out\nIt was supposed to phase out over Fifteen Years from thirty two percent to zero percent but within two years the Mexicans just started cheating\nAnd it was ... and it was it was practically gone because customs but not enforce it they didn't have and frankly we would enforce that piece that we don't have the funding or the manpower to pay the ...\nYear you're putting skin and bones on ... on an abstract problem is why I'm asking this question I Know the answer these questions can I talk to you\nUm she told me everything you just told me a ... you might have you might have a little more a little more time between that conversation and now might have a\nI guess crystallize and things to to to borrow turn of phrase there are in your business or might have crystallized some things um in in ... you you like that didn't you\nOr I figured out I find a way to get crystal worked in there somewhere [noise] um but uh I had that conversation with her and and she gave me a little too or the facility\nAnd to see a beautiful facility like that line basically dorm basically dormant and talking about all the hundreds of people who work there at one time uh\nAnd now it was just a couple of dozen two dozen people working there\nUm\nIt it it it may NAFTA real to me this is not this is not something I came\nI came to dislike because Donald Trump was running for office\nOr this is this is a very real problem this is a very a very real thing Donald Trump trying to get his hands around now nobody's standard of living nobody's nobody's income is as high as it was not not any category of people is as high as it was when NAFTA went enforced\nAnd the cost of products are not ... you\nKnow they're not but the quality is less\nAnd and the and the promises of NAFTA is free trade didn't materialized because it wasn't free trade it all we were sold a bill of goods that they were all these free trade agreements we were in an ending to even put it in the title North American free trade agreement one free at all it was a nine hundred fifty percent tariff on American dairy products going into Canada how's that free\nThere was not a nine hundred and fifty percent tariff on Canadian dairy products going back in the United states\nThere was a ten percent of going into Europe there's a twenty five or ... twenty five percent for our good go to Europe attempts that they're coming back over here how's that free we couldn't sell cars in Europe all their cars still over here\nWhen they look at the working conditions in Mexico versus what and not that we shouldn't be required to have you know good working safe working conditions or do you look at what they're able to do and the cost but they're able to God\nAnd and the and the white limits on their ... and ... you know Mexican truck come into the United states and break our white limit laws on our highway wear out or highways and they won't be on for it because that's part of NAFTA\n\nYep\nIt's a there's nothing free and fair about it there's nothing for your fair about it when you go back to a system of terrorists until everybody dropped all their barriers\nWhile and then now I only have free trade and and and I know even fast Eddie\nWould be fine competing in a completely free environment because than say these smart\nA infested he's got a business no how and and you could you could find a way to make a living in a completely free trade environment whereas businesses getting decimated under the global is control of America trade environment which was NAFTA and some of the other trade agreements garbage trade agreements we've rented in entered into the last thirty five years\nIt as well as our industry and I'm not not just me but my colleagues mocking batter on this for sure we can make the argument and actually that's not what we want to do\nThat's not what we're about I mean there were some companies that were all for it by\nSeventy five eighty percent of the companies were worse they don't want 'em family own and it was not what what what we want it and we did manage to lobby or I you know Fifteen your face and that we found out was not going to be enforced\nOr other you know we're actually valid raised\nUm\nThe ... and you're still a little bit and um I Can't think you know because like I said sitting and talking uh\nAt your facility gosh I guess that was four or five years ago now um\nAnd being brought up to speed or you you can study nap in the book you can you can read about in the magazine you can\nThink about it the existential Leon philosophically until you sit in a facility that's sitting there not being utilized with full capacity until you look around the neighborhoods and around the area around it and realized those people

S. buffets page share this we need to be calling the governor we need to be calling or representatives we need to demand change we need to demand it quickly because\nUh you know these these violent people being back on the street are just going to\nContinue to commit violent crimes I'll give you another example we had been told that another person up for parole who's in prison on his second murder times two is up for parole again\nSo he he's already committed one murder\nGone to prison got out as committed another murder and now this parole board is putting them back up or ... that if someone they shouldn't even be considering but yet here we are I mean I you know running where's the space ... what's the time difference when the point that he committed the murder\nAnd then the point that he was in jail and how long was in prison\nIf Russia or the first murder was many years ago who hey so I mean it's not like this all happened within a five year period so there is some time but it doesn't matter I mean one murder and you get out and you committed another murder you know track record we have an example of that Mario Woodward who killed officer police officer Keith out\nYou know um he he had been in prison for murder and got out and then course killed officer house so you know it's if they do their job\nWhich I Know that's asking a lot but if they would just do their job\nAnd stop a\nYou know just on a on a whim letting these folks out and if they had public safety at the head of of their thoughts and then their thought process and what they're supposed to be doing none of this would be happening but you know I'm at the point where I don't think they care about public safety I think they care about money dollars\nI was told that I don't know if it was the commissioner of deal sea but one of the high level\nMembers that deal sea was at the parole board during these ah most recent hearings that we had where this guy was let out that lets me know I mean he could have been there for something else I'm not going to say that but it does at least I'm Lynn some credibility that deal sea is pushing for this as well\nAnd hey the governor controls all this I think the governor and you know I've been in contact with the governor they assured me that they're going to address is ... and I believe that\nBut you know I think the governor needs to act in these that quickly because again we don't need anybody else losing their lives because of what these Yahoo's are doing that but the ... there's going to go to Henry Henry on board with a day do they like\nCome on and they and how you doing doing good Henry that afternoon\nYeah land they hadn't been calling on just on the call and say I think that our district attorney on my neighbor I Darrell Bailey during an outstanding job and I have caught in one hundred percent and I'll stop mom going do um when I get out of time with that at this attorney I'm a corridor governor's office\nAnd I also have an email address\nBut I just think that we can't um\nPut our police officers and more in danger we get them off the street and van that parole board is putting on back on the street\nYou know that's not right but ... mayor Montgomery a police department they're doing a great job a district attorney he's doing an outstanding job so\nWe got to do something about it but I'm a call the governor's office when I get off their land here an awesome offend the government on email but this is right there for that parole board\nTo not get these um people to serve their term and putting them right back here on in the street\nThank you for your comments or by the way down just for your knowledge this is this man has the best kept yard in the\nYard or is it is a Mac [laughter]\nBut uh he's exactly right the one thing I Would tell you go and do is it's not just police officers that are in danger you are in danger your wife is ... every body in our community is in danger when we're letting these violent type a violent offenders out you know the battle that they were in prison for killing\nTrue at all set of past comments is a good future and the\nCapsule Italy for instance what brought all this up and is is really shown to light on what's going on at the parole board is this guy who committed these multiple robberies and shot a man almost killing him\nWhen he goes to prison does ... does he take advantage of the classes as the other is education does he do what he's supposed to know\nOr he goes and attacks prison guards commits a sex offense does all these things that we should show a parole board or anybody reviewing his father hey this is not a person that needs to be back out on the streets\nAre great OK yeah\nBut how many of those people are actually a ... I think you said one hundred eighty people\nWent up five ... five hundred and fifty one\nOkay so a hundred and eighty got rolled out back and they have yes if I listed three that were really the most ...\nCriminals that aren't yet we would all agree should never ever had been granted parole and I will agree those three should not maybe we need some kind of legislative\nBut have we created such obscure such a wide variety of latitude or the parole board to be given in in station making maybe we we definitely have to restrict that\nNo doubt yeah so I grew up you know some states have been told have ah the governor actually has the authority to reverse parole board decisions um\nYou know that's a good thing yeah I'm I'm not you actually have somebody that's been elected to be held accountable I've never heard of in a lecture or any of our ... members or they're not in lower pointed candy and Alabama there's no civil or any kind of\nRetribution towards them should they\nKnow and and here's the problem here is the problem with the parole board which is which was mentioned in article is that they really don't have any government um [noise] they can pretty much do what they want to when they want to and and that's a shame the board\nSays the same amount of damage is not a good system it up\nBut now the people you hold responsible are the elected officials and our elected officials who put those parole board members on the board now\nI'm not a curious what are the qualifications to be a ... or ... million on thousand their ages as qualified as there is no qualifications and that's what's sad\nYeah now you know it's it's really a part time job to get a vehicle and they're paid over a hundred thousand dollars a year is ... it's a pretty ...\n[laughter] [laughter] um so are you gentlemen appreciate your time yeah\nThanks bye appreciate the of the board system in Alabama's of I mean whether you're talking about hair cousin Haji border you're talking about ethics commission as terrible as long as you go to Ken can work on board today Marcia\nHey Dan [noise] got a question for Mr Bailey um I'm actually looking at it from the other side of the spectrum\nI don't think it's strict enough because obviously going to prison is not a deterrent for crime anymore and I'm curious what you at the district attorney see the possibility of changing the white punishment is held out to make it an actual deterrent once again in this nation\nWell first of all we've got to do what we're ... we got to be honest about what we're doing now is a for all I mean nobody knows that the judge doesn't know the prosecutor doesn't know the victim doesn't know the defendant doesn't know defense attorney nobody knows\nWhen sentences handed down how long that person's going to serve in prison we don't even have a wild guess anymore\nI'm ... you look at the parole boards own rules which I have in front of me right now that says that on a volunteer fence that the initial parole consideration Shelby set\nAfter an inmates completion of eighty five percent of his or her total sentence or Fifteen Years which is less well we know that's not true that we know that they're not even following their own policies\nSo you know the first thing we're gonna have to do and we were promised this by our legislature and I hate to keep bringing this up but our legislature is pitiful\nYou know they promised us when we had sentencing reform that at some point in this process that we were going to have truth in sentencing so that we all knew everybody knows when someone has given us in it that is what they're saying this is going to be so all they met\nNow about the deeper issues that particular event is light heavier otherwise is deterring crime how do you as a law enforcement official had a solution to stop the crimes from happening in the first place people are scared to go to prison is what I'm getting at\nThat means nothing anymore\nThat probably depends on the person I don't necessarily disagree with you but there are some there are a lot of ...\nBack so I won't say there's not a deterrent to to everyone but you know this is obviously very complicated one of the things that we have to do and I talk about this all the time went down when I'm Alone on on the other topics is that we've got to be proactive or you know working with\nKids and parents and everybody else to keep the kids and\nA vigil are people who grew into adults out of the system to begin with if we got to reform that whole process you know our education system and\nYou know mental worrying and in all kinds of things that that we can do with that but as far as a deterrent you know once the crimes committed the only thing I Know it was prison um that's the only thing I Know can be a deterrent once someone has committed murder or solved or a robbery or something like that if you have\nBetter ideals I'd love to hear on because right now that's all I Know that we have in the criminal justice system\nIt seems a kitten dropped off there [noise]\nIt um you know of one of our favorite to law enforcement officer saying if one of the things that stops crime is keeping the criminals locked up there as soon as they are getting out of it even if they go in and doing most of the fence is they have a tendency to be to committing crimes [laughter] oh no don't go back in jail yeah\nI mean art Baylor when he was chief of police or Montgomery also or this week I mean he was famous for always saying you know it's two or three percent of the people who are committing the crime over and over and over again you know he'd hold up these rap sheets of these people there's been arrested multiple multiple multiple times\nAnd yeah I mean and I do believe that and you know obviously it's not helping matters by taking the violent offenders and putting them right back out on the street I mean what do we have\nA ... and you know vocal said it best these people down to live somewhere where they could be living next\nDoor to you and when you're sad part is they normally go back to where they came from having worked in\nHelping folks have gotten out of prison not to get back into that environment because they're saying that environment is where you learn and you had to go ... whenever I say you and your mom or with the bill type thing absolutely let's go to the phones to John and I have a question for your own way Jon welcome more today more show than we do a ...\nThat are violent how're you doing anything on doing great how are you a great

that's all I that's something you need to look into being there down in Montgomery County and the\nWell if I certainly had ended up all over a wealth of evidence of that uh I I Would but you know I think I think the the real issue is that they are getting pressure um it it does involve money but I think is the money that they are not wanting to spin\nOn attacks yeah and what what happens is these appointees don't warmer loser appointed position\nSo they are or they or you know answering to the people the politicians that have put them in power and put 'em in there's appointed positions which is happening and they want to make them happy and they want to make them happy by uh apparently in this situation by letting these prisoners out so they don't have to build more prisons\nAnd I'm not saying that the governor's doing this I I think the legislature right now is probably the more ...\nUh complicit complicit party\nBut you know were given the governor an opportunity to address this and I really think she will uh you know I talked to her legal advisor I think they're going to take this seriously\nAnd we've got um you know a few weeks to see what she'll do about\nIt saw also my understanding is I guess I mean for you if you're only what three members do bowling that's correct well like you need more members but you need them not appointed a bar or either of short term\nYeah down there yeah they don't even mention electing somebody to a prison board done ties are ... well before June would do\nIt or are you today great how about you pretty good\nThat look what's going on here in Alabama the way a theater that we hold and all these prisoners over in the county jail because of the prison system don't have room for all we got people staying in our county jails over here that he may not be big time offenders the south but they but but we don't have Ron Paul\nThough it's not just the issue here I go back ... years ago and they were doing the same thing

it's in part of the ... investigation of CBS News\nIs an inquiry and not an investigation or criminal probe the FBI cannot compel anyone to talk to them and these witnesses have no obligation to cooperate\nAnd addicts conclusion and the FBI will present an interview a summary of the interviews and corroborating materials in the White House but of course they're not going to come up with any conclusions in this case the White House is the client and they are delivering this background check product to the client\nSo some given has not going to exonerate anybody or can damn anybody even take a gathering of evidence and information how does he have the I hear about having to do\nThat listen this is another one of those case where there is dread with ...\nIn the center of a political firestorm when they don't want to let us ... exactly it's like the Russia investigation in a way for them so you know they're caught in the middle of this storm and no matter which way this goes they're not going to come out smelling like heroes and I did talk to a former assistant director\nOf the FBI Chris what or who says you know they're going to have their best agents on this case and they're going to treat it like any other background\nCheck for the FBI or and they're going to do this just like\nIt or any other case\nThat's I think and what you just said about recording that it's really an inquiry and not and I'm thinking about that is very important in early ... that no matter how it turns out a whole lot of people on one side are not going to be happening\nThere isn't that he mentioned uh just mentioned is the one that I had known as it goes from from yesterday solution let's go down and listen and Lindsey Graham talking about the timeline or investigation and McConnell

the FBI to interview the three Ford witnesses that were interviewed by the Republicans on the committee Democrats wouldn't help us us PJ I'm a nurse Leyland Leyland a plus or less friend yeah a and a mark judge\nUh let's see Lisa Murkowski said I'd like the FBI to kind of check the committee's homework and we also agreed to interview Mr Mir is the allegation not printed by then it was the New Yorker fright leak\nOr what's the FBI has done their interviews they send it back to the Senate and if they want further interviews cell Saddam was Sarah McConnell and see what we can work out the way to deal for a week\nWe limited the interviews to three people named Dr Ford and miss for ... and we'll see what the FBI fine has now been expanded out by the way it is that the the president said now that said no it's not that this is a request by the Senate\nWhere nobody asked to do miss a swim eras yeah or a marriage you know nobody asked for that and not one Democrat ask a question the senators in question did not till that was necessary is a accusation on his face that makes no sense so let me go over to get\nThe ... report witnesses Martin judge a Leland or an PJ right right and this from ... that's it do it within a week report back to the Senate and a will move forward\nOkay so he can read it at the time on there and um now he's saying that it was it was the Fort ... story is way

I got one say something stupid\nHey my name is ... oh shut up you can ... ... I like cabbage it that's a pretty good and so\nWe using to let it out folks I don't think there's enough emotion and just pride full offense being taken on both sides too many damn snowflakes and I'm not just talking about um a left\nI'm Sorry but I'm just going to say Neal that Packers game or they had the band on the field like man that ridiculous ... but they bused\nIn years past because it's\nEssentially short him for the American flag but also the state fly for centrally it's like what the color guard would carry out onto the field and they've used before and so people were immediately suspicious like [noise] and\nThat's the thing Joey I don't get all but her to live like that I don't give a flying ...\n... no ... tried to make but like habit and cabbage as it's happening cat ...\nI I really you know I mean that is a outrage some here's another one I saw and I'm picking on the right right now tonight we're Sheila Jackson Lee walked up to\nBloody Ford's lawyer or a boy and handed him the envelope and people are like all sorts of conspiracies got when we moved out of that\nIs most likely a question of what it was it was like letters of support from like her constituents well and the Democrats were doing I now I Do not believe that no but like all the Democrats were doing no it's plausible to me because that's what they were all doing when they had a chance to ask a question\nOf who you are such a champion and thank you for coming forward and I'd like to submit into the record Mr Chairman of these thousand female doctors are a bottom line is Dr Ford\nHadn't I don't buy that for a minute you know ... what do you think of his payment from Soros no I don't think it was payment it all out to eat at midnight would surely they're not that stupid I understand that liberal Democrats are ignorant\nThat they're they're just stupid but I don't think they're even that state but okay I just like it was hail asked this question or answer this question if he\nAlso got to think about Sheila Jackson Lee she's always the one up front the photo op with the hand like when the state of the unions are going on with bronco Obama's president she was always up front front and center got to get that handshake got to talk to them at the big political theater\nInvent like this is I think that's all she was doing it's like Oh hi here is like my two cents on the subject I'm not in the Senate but here are my two\nSo I I I really don't care one way or the other I think the whole deal has been just nothing but a far so and I and I really me your show you talk about what you want to but I just really am sick and tired of talking about this crap 'cause it's just it's just\nIt's it's everybody's mind is already made up nobody's mind is going to be chained rice and even when the FBI comes out tomorrow and says hey I ain't nothing to it\nThere's gonna be you know gnashing of teeth weeping and wailing from the land in the rye is going to be saying see we told Jim Wright and if it was vice versa it would be the same thing wow\nYeah I mean that's just something that's just the way it goes and I think I think a good man's name has been drove through the mud I mean ah not to excuse if he did any of that yes this is ... it's just horrible\nOh I like the most tragic I don't think this is true that is just speculating here the most tragic\nWay this story could've gone is that he did blackout he does not remember\nLike he just and because he does not remember he is acting like a man falsely accused\n'cause you know if you have no recollection of something well but no nor does she though\nI mean well actually she does it's a hundred percent certain that hundred percent certain that she got out of\nHouse and nothing physically happened to her I mean it's still wrong and you know it was somebody in a way to describe it but she got out and does not remember how she got to the party how she got home from the time I didn't want to talk about the if I'm\nGoing on in the same around okay you know let's go to something else alright ass hat All right well I Am an asset thank you yeah resemble that remark liquor that's a weird what messed up saying that\nThe news all day today and that he might have helped her is going to go out and trap\nCalling at ... okay all these problems exist in the city how is it that I've lived here for with the exception of four years of my life\nSo that's probably twenty five years I've lived here going about my day never once had a problem with any of these so called problems in Montgomery whether it's schools\nCrime or feral cats I guess I'm just oblivious I think\nSqueaky wheels is what it is ... the grand or ... that are making ingest is\nIf if there is enough money out there that people are donating to the humane shelter to actually pay someone to go out and actually trap these animals right bring a man do the surgery on them you rehabilitate I mean it's not that long above ... where do you have bill ... Haitian\nRight you know but\nTo take care of them and then to introduce them back out into the\nWild I don't get the word is like if you're going to go through all that trouble why are you just putting them back out there where where where's that money coming from is my question is why we have a big cat for a man 'cause cats they don't just listen to how it sounds like you could create a big toll fence with the cage\nLike we are able to keep like eagles and as\nWe can keep like cats curled around get but say they go about how that falls from the lips cat farm you're going to Montgomery tomorrow\nYeah make two hour drive down there around or we're going to go see the\nCat for a great idea don't you think\nWell maybe you could even generate some revenue that way you would have crazy cat ladies from all over\nFeral cat population right feral cats are bad man\nYeah they're ... they're young yeah don't get me started on chickens again and look at this question is generated calls and says oh you're on the air\n[laughter] going on I'm calling about the cats I was just saying yeah I can understand you somebody\nAs a jump from Tuscaloosa bomb show which I got more on up there\nIt was to side with we catch these cats and we ... them and we let them back out and they'll be out raising and you only get ... but trouble is that just won't work 'cause they'll probably still if you know get their their breeding with anything they say so it don't work\nRight and then they'll like feed on each other then you've got a feral cat eating one another problem it's because of this year though\nLike my cat forum idea where if they are a threat than others and the cat forum than we can keep them behind cages to make money\nYou put them in a house in our house on the [laughter]\n\nMen get out of ... tourists to come down to the house yeah\nAnd I asked him disappointed tourist in this on the customers but it will generate revenue\nMan Tony I thought this was going to be a good bachelor party but this cat it took a term for the worst [laughter]\nOne of the trunk and that was like oh my God all like the one of those were the work out\nA friendship the Gulf British changing\nAh wow look at what she started here you know the cat farm cat how will question why is this such a big deal in Montgomery I did not know they were that many feral cats wrongly Montgomery some thing do brought up\n[laughter] ass hat yeah but let's not stop making butler tried to happen Cabot shed new sock you're on there who is this a barren Erin\nHi well I think all done by bright green dollars lost ... ... ... ... ... we're not Chinese restaurant\nActually no\nLonger make you make nine my Chinese off the audience you know I have not even thought about that care and is it what are we going to get when we order sweet and sour pork what are they going to put in that now the Africa power from bottom now\nIsn't it it's not China isn't it Thailand where they actually will eat dog I I Can't remember\nWhat it actually art out yeah that might not be you're going to get our Fertig right\n[laughter] right exactly there you go yes ma'am and I'm Glad you called them out as some ding dong bringing the suck\nThat I'm just glad you don't charge us for subscription figure\n[laughter] when I got a good night oh that was ... I Know that care and as soon as I go back to the phones and install cars this year\nAnd Karen is but it Edie Edie Edie hey hey look you're asset why he want to shoot my cat [laughter] you have a feral cat\nWell I've got a couple of cats and you know up here on the lake we like to do their federal thing\nWhere we're not talking about the lake Eddie well I mean we're talking about the city of Montgomery\nI'd want to make sure that my cats are safe now you're in you're on the boat tour if I'm going to give you a boat tour St worried about you shouldn't be that\nThis is why I Would be responsible mayor unlike southern would here is trying to find to be the shadow mayor behind jak Campbell yeah one of the vice mayor advice all the vice mayor shadow about\nNo this is why I Would be better mayor or vice mayor than southern motor here because I already suggested that letting people loose with twenty two to shoot\nYou've got a twenty two problem\nNow there's no law one time and Anchorage, Alaska years ago we had so many moves in the city they had a a temporary bow hunting season for loose in the city\nBank sank you temporary okay look as bowl honey you suggested twenty two I'll go halfway with color here I Will go halfway both hunt the cats you get rid of\nTo cross though you lay on the ground that would be some entertaining honey yeah but how many people well known there probably some skill though\nVoters around here chair and there was a very long ago even her and her\nCompound boat we're in Montgomery, Alabama right around age do you think there are around any plenty I just don't want some ding dong missing the cat and shoot me in the high I I ... okay here we go I don't know I don't I don't I've got I've got I just had an epiphany so how about ... [noise]\nYou know how they do down in like Louisiana in Florida they they don't they sale tags for gators mhm and they all should them off\nAnd so you can only kill so many gators rife sale tags for the feral cats and make it a hunting sport within the city of Montgomery and imagine how much you can auction those tags all for and you get like two tags it the most\nAnd you have to get in line to go out in ... in both on it maybe I tell you have maybe genetically as a slingshot\nWhat if you had to kill them with a bow staff a staff that host that what the boat had not seen Napoleon Dynamite yes but it's been a while and well he's got crazy bow staff skills\nAnd you have it and then the cat I still like my cat farm idea\nNo killing involved unless they get on really what the visitors well\nWhat I'm worried about is Joey riding down the hair his are riding down the road is a beautiful hair blowing into breeze I was ... somebody misses a cat and enjoy it comes to work with an arrow through his but\nYeah this is I don't want this I mean hey\nYou you live in a I mean that's just part live originally take I guess that's it well you have a good night didn't do it to be as high as they uh\nYou probably not bring that back we're gonna make it happen for twenty twenty he probably have a better chance of getting shot by a stray bullet in Montgomery then somebody actually ride him pale anew with an arrow thing at a feral cat\n... yes it is this this is actually a problem you heard about earlier this it ... it it really good at ...\nI've been trouble believing the Montgomery humane shelter in and they do what are they doing a dumpster I don't know they do God's\nWork but it is banned own the ah the news blog all day to day at at the breaks that they are going to implement this program\nBut I I just thought it was ridiculous you or getting me on a topic that's been on one lately feral cats feral cats I'm thinking about getting a big cat no not like a tiger or\nBlack Panther or anything like a ... like\nA ...\nBig fat lazy cat you're looking at me\nLike that's about it well I mean good luck with that captured this weird yet I've told you about Chad ... is he ill tempered\nChad more says like half dog half cat and but she named them Chad Morris well hell that's just one of his name is but [laughter] yeah [laughter] ... he is the coolest cat he he sleeps in the band was with with Lauren and I ... ...\nWhen I get up I'm burden to slap and took he works\nActually that is a different story for different day and and but I Will tell you about\nHey actually play slap but it wasn't no damn tickled to slap and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Coosada", "day": "02"}
