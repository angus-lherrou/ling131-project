whether the husband or the wife is more likely to do it and I'll take my answer off air\nLike heroin\nFrontal alienation parental alienation ... yeah yeah you know we actually we see a lot but it is really\nReally tough to get a judge around here to really recognize it and and ...\nHold somebody accountable if I'm going with the principal alienation is is typically seen in a situation where one parent is using their parental authority over a child to just like the ... the worth of alienate the other parents so you'll see behaviors where I'm\nThe parent doesn't allow their parents to communicate with the child or they don't they don't notify them of the child's um activities um they they undermine the authority of the parent and it's really has that he would undermine the love of the parents saying things to a parent like\nWell if daddy luggage he be here eh if daddy loves he would do X Y or Z if mommy loved you she would and slowly over time you alienate the child and or the parents from from the relationship\nTo where the child than starts to cling towards the other parent [noise]\nUm and it it can cause severe adverse effects on your children we see a lot and contested divorces I'm where maybe the\nChild is living with one parent in over time that the relationship starts to deteriorate because of these purposeful actions done by the other parent to\nAlienate I mean I Can't even think of another word besides alienate the parent from the child's life [noise]\nUm yeah and and you know when we see it we see some cases that are just you know\nBad blood between parents but a lot of times when we see it it's really really blatant and it's because one parent just can't let it go and just can't get over their personal feelings as of feeling fine and uh\nWhat what is going to be you know therefore my partner and therefore spouse and\nThe the child really really suffers and you know I think some of it has to do with with our clientele the fact that that we have more more men and women but we see more and women but again it that\nSome of that has to do with the fact that women get primary physical custody probably more than men do usually more than ...\nSituation where they have they have the children um before we get involved and so it's been going on for a while\nRight but it's like you know if you if you know dad were to than like a Christmas

we talk about several things including the psycho man the him which was ...\nThe originator of the term near death experience and let us bring in Joshua pie worn right now hello there Mr Warren\n... hey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight it's Halloween the event oh I Love it\nOr we're going to dig into this extremely creepy thing it's like a man the mirrors I also have an update for you\nAbout time warps in UFOs or later on we are going to give away some free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday and there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with your\n... and the way I'm bummed 'cause I got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of me will be with you OK\nWell ... you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank you\nYou've got that aren't the cycle man the ... it's a small enclosed area set up with a chair dim lighting the mirror is angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd the number of other people in person in the Sacramento him technique um and it it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager\nBecause I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the or a local newspaper and I found again and again when I go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and said this is the most talented room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I find a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomena um there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors face each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infinite tunnel\nRight like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light as electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of light which operates has some sort of a portal [noise]\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know what consciousness is when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of the spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to cry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience Georgian and then I Want everybody to understand this I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or\nAnd it's like state known them when you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly\nWe knew perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional seemingly core portrayal figure that will appear right in front of your head to toe\nAnd this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but touch [noise]\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHot even getting rid of the spirit if you want to go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother\nThen he would take you through a period of time that could be days where he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find the reminds you of her and he pictures\nAnd he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there\nYour mind is charged with the intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through now when this becomes very scary as when you have people who experiment\nOr you know people talk about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble that sort of thing you know the people who go in there\nAnd they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude that is a danger that added to you you will well you know if you get what you ask for right\nI just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a cycle Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments where you know we'll set up a camera to see if we can record they experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in front\nOf it and I'm not that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nBloody Mary and boy you know all that kind of stuff yeah I think ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays L. E. D. left in the background\nAnd maybe some light and ... I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with a and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento him experience and I would say that a lot of people chores or is it is a lot of people you know I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody\nAnd a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and above\nThat's dramatic Josh stay with us we'll come back and talk about time warps and some UFOs here's our first emerging artists all Ruben from Santa Barbara California wants a song called winter when\nWay to\n\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and the ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia and Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between\nLas Vegas that area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the ... state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nAnd so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can capture something else\nBut in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um I mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way a very cool that you played a a a group from Asheville North\nSuppose my home town for for listeners who may not know\nAnd uh you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting to play an Ashville group [noise] but anyway Georgia Nashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context okay [noise]\nUm and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just coincidence or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that as sort of a moving slowly revealed or exposed however you want to hear it\nAnd of course I never believe in coincidence is Josh\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe and that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and\nJust doesn't make sense does it Jordan new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that the that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media but it was not it was not no I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop\nUh and this was a program that was a course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was who was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada\nTo keep that in mind uh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow up [noise] now later in the month of June to\nBe precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night\nThat I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force so here I Am next to Harry fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announces there is an underground lake on Mars\nAnd also right around the same time George Jeanette whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in a state of Nevada and a good one\nYes he is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine\nIf any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it this is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional\nIt was on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management and safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient he goes on to say even more\nAnd this is the one that really gets me associated exotic ... now that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies\nLikely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries an unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here so he said and\nThis letter which is a validated it's been verified I've independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise] he's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's why we need we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is that didn't come from them new\nSo if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic where could have possibly come from um I also wanted to just mentioned the here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to this where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project and some of these topics there's thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes in space time gravity wave communication worked drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and a ... which which July twenty fifth alright so that said\nNow we move up to August\nAugust twenty eighth team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville ... the mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry which is very similar\nTo a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb\nAnd they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beach to nail us air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore guests when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space force\nSo that said\nI Am of the impression here\nThat there is some kind of amazing technology that is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where the\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt what I'm telling you you can download this information for free if you go to Joshua ... dot com\nAnd scroll down the home page there's a place where you can it says something like you know Senator Harry Reid's PDF or whatever and you can you can download that\nNow you tell me George do you think that that is all coincidence that this stuff is lining up the way it is\nNo coincidence you know that none in the let me ask you this when the late president Ronald Reagan initiated and wanted to initiate his Star Wars program I was convinced he was more concerned about something coming from outer space that we needed to protect ourselves from\nWhen President Trump announced a space for ... do you think it was the same motives [noise]\nI think it was certainly part of it uh well for one thing there's probably

Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring a most of Japan uh easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread stories to the civilians\nThat if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and you know God Knows what else ... civilians are insulate them\nScare the living daylights on right\nAbsolutely terrified so when the Americans did invade\nThe ah civilians were would run off of cliffs and commit suicide and then you know that's a documented piece of history\nJust a terrifying uh a story but now there are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book\nIs that a group of tourists were added peace museum near those cliffs and they were walking in the field near that that museum and they heard the sound of what they considered and they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything\nAnd then they felt a wind pass them and then later heard what they described as cries and screams to that was pretty moving for me um another story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um a heartbreaking and\nHe would Jima it there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably buried alive because they were ... they were a in a tunnel system a very intricate tunnel system under the island and um\nThe the entrances caved in or or or the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels\nSo there's a story that I write about that one\nA Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland and he\nUh he he gets a knock on the door and he claims that these spirits of these soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan to those are some pretty intense stories\nThat a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not rare uh in in this volume Middle East what's interesting\nToo mad is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on\nYeah that's true and not only are they everywhere that the different one of the amazing aspects of of the world war two supernatural is that the goose don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over England\nAlmost like the flying Dutch been the ship yeah absolutely exactly people see these planes and they're really not there yeah this is a ... and I'll tell you a little story from my own family did they hear them too\nWell some do and some don't but there's one area or in the United kingdom I'm\nA it's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer\nAnd it's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um the u._k. it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I don't know why there's such activity but there have been a lot of plane crashes there about fifty planes they think of have crashed in that area\nAnd it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been what they call goes plane flaps so for example in Nineteen eighty five I'm a bunch of people a claim to seeing this huge military aircraft flying overhead\nI mean down the highway and they saw this very low flying bomber cruising over the highway and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and uh you know I think they described it as a for prop ... engine and it looked like a World War two bomber\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know either a current military plane or possibly a um\nMaybe a a bomb or going to an air show or something like that was what they want they thought yeah\nYou're right but to counter that a lot of these people that solve this first of all\nThere didn't seem to be a pattern a flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft\nDisappeared in different areas throughout that region and a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular works a\nFor a an airfield during World War two he was a I Believe I'm\nA somewhat a flight mechanic for the for the ... or or a half\nSo definitely would've known the difference between let's say a modern\nI guess like a Hercules aircraft and something like a beat twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it would be twenty four bomber so a pretty peculiar in and there have been other what they called ghost playing flaps a throughout history\nAnd I think there was even one as I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nIf the one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust like that yeah yeah like they want to do a different time warp or something right and\nThe reason I looked into the these are a goes planes stories is when I was young\nMy parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they were a starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft\nComing down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy uh\nYou'd make it sound went overhead and then just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Erie\nThat what it was my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well\nEngland was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any story similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handle hundreds of them were gonna come back and talk more about how to World War two next hour you share your questions and stories ...\n... there's no conveniently optimize ... if you're a ghost inside or you can listen to live in his shoes right on your boom just visit goes to goes to um don't come on your iPhone or Android rooms\n[noise]\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast Matthew Swain with us is website is linked up the coast to coast am dot com couple of his other books haunted rock and roll ghosts of country music more hunted rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest punch in World War two soldiers spirits ghost planes and strange synchronous cities Pearl Harbor is an inch or not\nIt's extremely haunted according to a lot of the people that go there and uh\nBut any of the people towards people who were interested in history go there uh we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're touring Pearl Harbor especially the the USS Arizona memorial which is essentially a tune a mass grave\n'em and it'll tell you would have a moving experiences and again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor and the ghost stories that\nHave been told about that a famous area or are pretty extensive there's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left is watch on the USS Arizona I'm just briefly and then\nDuring that time where he left the ship it was attacked and sunk and now there's this story of this for Lauren ...\nStanding on the edge of the the memorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona now ras or so that goes story has been told\nA quite a bit um [noise] excuse me sir there's also a story of a of all of\nOne lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course the waves in the memorial and then when she looked at it there seem to be faces\nIn them into the picture is a very uh in that went on online throughout and not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted by therapy and go stories at places like the show field barracks\nAnd hit them airbase areas that were a part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and one place in particular in heck I'm\nA there was the headquarters building that uh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it and the places so haunted they said that they moved to the sea cue desk which is usually inside the building\nThey say now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound of people running up and down steps to such a degree that are the steps the staircase itself would shake so it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nNo desert Fox rumble or the the knock the tens or tank leader had some incredible things happened to him to he died in Nineteen forty four mhm but what does he still haunts\nThat's probably the most interesting a story that I found a\nA when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially looks to see if I could find the ghosts of a lot of famous general's pat ... an hour as well as some of them the axis powers and Erwin ... has always been\nKind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to [noise] you know try to find if there were any ghost stories about him uh I I thought he might be found in North Africa which is where he gained much of his fame as the desert Fox\nMay be on the shores of Normandy he would be among those many goes that appear\nIn Normandy he was really behind a a architecture the development of the fortifications there are in the construction of the defenses along with what was considered the their Atlantic Wall\nOr maybe he would be in Germany but I actually found go stories about ... in the United states believe it or not so one of the places as mount Hebron cemetery and Winchester, Virginia\nPeople claim to see this a figure a long trench coat a cap on\nA looking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the\nThe graves or he's seen at the graves of some of patents\nA general Patton fans testers and then there's a A N in West Virginia where they claimed that raw Mohan so what's the story behind that there is a story that\nAre between the wars wrong all along with a few other German generals travel on a secret trip to America\nTo visit some of the ... the battlefields of the civil war particularly they were looking at the way the Stonewall Jackson maneuvered through the Shenandoah Valley so this is why\nOr when ... haunts these areas is is around today they think that uh he has left his spirit here because he once once visited the site now is there any historical basis for this\nI haven't been able to find any in most historians will tell you that it never had happened that the German generals never came here are people who believe these stories say it was a a secret mission and therefore there would be no historic record that was kind of the interesting one for me\nAnd what about other World War two infamous people do they still show up on\nWell there's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still haunts a subway in a\nIn a in London that once served as kind of a temporary bomb shelter and and and people have seen his spirit there I found the story that Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln in World War two\nTo be fascinating a he said that he and I hate to lay the imagery on your listeners but\nA according to Churchill he had to step down to the bathroom completely naked in what's now called the Lincoln Bedroom of the White House and he had traveled to the White House on several occasions\nTo visit with a ... FDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt as well as other uh officials from the American side\nHe steps out of the the bathroom and there's Abraham Lincoln leaning against the mantle and I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Churchill said something like ah I see you've caught me at a disadvantage Mr President and then a Lincoln fades away so that was kind of\nLincoln probably faded away quickly\nYes I I would've I would've got out there as fast as I could he's Lincoln has gone through enough he didn't need the witness\nNot I'm not a new Winston Churchill\n... so there's some other stories about Eisenhower he haunts ah what's called the bullet which is a a train that's on display at the national railroad museum I think that's in in Green Bay Wisconsin\nOr we talked a little bit about the ghosts of Gettysburg and apparently he andme Amy maybe behind some of the haunting Z in the farmhouse that they used to own their\nSo yeah there's a a lot of um a famous ghost stories from uh some of the the bigger leaders of uh the most famous leaders of World War two and\nDisease continue these haunting\nYeah they do as a matter of fact uh you know the ... the bullet a I Believe there's the story that some of the stories that I found out about that\nA war from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm a custodian who was a vacuuming the carpet in the bullet\n... uh was halfway finished and decided to take a break left to lock the door of the the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when he came back\nThe someone had completed\nThe vacuuming and he could tell because the lines of the vacuum cleaner were super straight up and down\nAnd according to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous and that's how he insisted on having his the bullet cleaned so that story probably uh not too long ago\nAnd you know as we talked about the ghost plane flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nIn back in World War two there were actually reports of UFOs they called them ... fighters and they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place that pilots\nYeah I actually did a whole section on it because they were so prevalent as you point out\nAnd and it's based on my research and my reading about that\nEssentially the whole modern UFO UFO era\nStarts in World War two with some of these sightings of these strange lights and objects that the American flyers used to just call a few fighters\nThat alone ... five to ten percent how about a three time unit for only four thousand nine hundred Ninety six dollars cat they the direct will pay you money he'd called tend to explore sixty four sixty for it and like the girl say hard\nA law out there the license number nine two to four from\nChevrolet Master control center this is W.

that's going to be part of a and part being is going to be\nBut I'm not going to vote for but it wasn't\nI'm I'm with ... and that was one of the best speeches I've heard it was masterful in a long time it was absolutely\nMasterful and and and she showed why she's good to have on the team you know you need a Susan Collins on the team and Trump price or after that I did yeah so she's up for election and twenty twenty and she decided to run again they've they've raised millions of dollars against it but you know what\nWhen you do something like that for the team they make sure you get ... damn right and Lindsey to they'll they'll spend as much money as it takes to get those guys reelected 'cause they showed that they're on the team and I'm I'm telling you Donald Trump will campaign for

the conservative tree house this morning and I thought X or\nOf ah Christine Blasey Ford uh\nEnding behind or was that Monica leave my client yeah she was there so she was there obviously are for ratings than a that was the observation and the question is since um there are so many holes and what she has had the state\nUh and the fact that uh there was a leak out of a Dianne Feinstein the office I Believe that you think that the Republicans are going to have the wave of those\nWho are really investigate this thing and and I think if they did that that would go a long way towards a clearing a\nCabin on his name but it would also help in the terms if it was they were able to show that this was a total set up as my class\nThat would be tough to do in in under thirty days I don't agree with doing it I think if you're gonna do you wait till after the election because\nYou don't want to get the Democrats who a lot of them that they have not read what we've all read him ...\nWho don't know what we know it's just kind of fire them on their demoralizing deflated ride right in and we need to keep 'em that way if we go after this woman that's just going to give them more resolved to win and we don't want that right now that's my opinion about\nFollow up and do you think they should do it after the election\nIf I don't think you can go after I don't want to make a martyr out of her um\nI think grand let her do that over the weekend he didn't want to do anything you just let her go with\nSomebody says something about dark plenty with a\nI don't know if somebody was telling

made that speech Saturday Night there was a\nStem wander um [noise] that's all he needs to do between now and November six whenever the day to the election is is travel and get people fired up that's

this United\nAnd and and to think the guy who\nWas absolutely was threatening to tear the party of part is what they were telling us that Donald Trump destroy the Republican Party's gonna tear the party limb from limb the party will never recovered the Democrats control for eighty years after Donald Trump has done with it ... this guy who's done more to unite the Republican Party because he he

supposed to be the one going I'm drunk talented died in a plane crash\nYeah so that that is so that um I I actually printed the story must have made the Clintons man to he was he was a apparently connected the vessel in the sky or the the lawyer who went to Trump Tower and supposedly said she had the dirt and all that it was when a plane crash was a helicopter crash wasn't it\n\nWell that's not surprising I just as they are but you know maybe now that this is over with 'em and still no no no tape for Mahler or Rosa or anything as sure as quiet on that front end man\nIt is I think it's going to be quiet until after the election I kind of predicted that about sixty days ago that if they didn't do something around Labor Day they probably wouldn't do it for a while\nAnd I noticed a flu shot\nCommercials are coming out and just to think probably fifty million people are about to get those those are the flu and the United states stopped very encouraging to may stay\nAway from the flu shot people and that's your medical advice from your humble talk show host stay away from the flu shot\nAnd that includes man it gets a lot I mean it's all about the money man they're making these problems\nMe tell you did you see the news the other day there's an eighty thousand people die from the flu last year that is the biggest bunch of BS lies I have ever heard there is a date for that that wall they're talking about the United states any all my guy\nIs no way eighty thousand people die from the flu because what happens if you die because you're older and farm\nThe flu or they could blame on food they they chalked it up to the flu then yeah yeah you die doesn't mean you die to the floor\nAnd now they're starting to hash or have more advertising for the aged TV a\nVirus to expand it so I'm I'm a that I'm really wary of all the vaccinations ban\nI you know it's funny I I did something today I I I read rented a lot do you ever get on rent it rent up already DDAT\nIt's like it's a great little website ah it you gotta you gotta be careful how you navigate it and there's some stuff and they probably want to see but but if you just look at the front page I started noticing months ago and I brought this to attention to kill people there's a concerted pro vaccine\nCampaign underway to look like it's grass roots\nOr to minimize and make fun of people who either delay or don't get the full doses of rounds of vaccines okay this is this is a a plastic renting every day or two you'll see some\nPro vaccination post make it all the way to the top of the front page and so I did notice and that and the one today was a um about how\nEverybody or this guy had a friend from Kazakhstan\nAnd he comes in the United states and you can't believe how morbidly obese everybody is he has to keep telling his friends stop pointing at everybody and tell them that are obese and this cosmic standing friend was like well I don't know about all the you know well somebody in the comment made a comment about well it you know at least are or were alive over here because they don't\nWell I started looking at cosmic stands vaccination schedule\nAnd then that put me on to looking at vaccination schedule around the world\nThey probably don't have one well they do they get polio\nAnd they get ... and they get um um\nSomething that we don't get vaccinated for over here like yellow fever or something like that\nYeah that too much all the get welfare you and they don't they don't mate\nThey don't get him him or they don't get chicken pox they don't get flu every year they don't get all this other stuff that are they I don't I don't believe they got hit me maybe they did get hit be\nUm but you know that's a sexually transmitted disease after as me and they're given it to our children like the ... hour they get out of the womb [noise] well I I've yet to have a child yet sexually active with our out of the womb and\nHow and seen is that is scary man and you know like I say big farmers got everybody all the government bothered that\nWe need to go back to where you know I I lost my vaccination records along the way changing schools or whatever\nAnd when I went to law school they wouldn't let me in school unless I was current on all vaccinations I had to get for someone born in Nineteen Seventy nine in India [noise] so they went on hold the Indiana schedule and I had to go through and get that whole schedule done shower\nUpsurge shots I've gotten total\nTo be completely current with what Nineteen a child born in Nineteen Seventy nine needed I got eight total shots\nGosh eight eight you know how many shots you get today in order to be current for a child born in the you're twenty eight ... an hour no Seventy\nIt's so nice thirdly written Hitler's number of shots you have to get now\nAre thinking about that I'm telling you and they're all that aside and I'll do that in our mayor jaguars into but\n[laughter] thank you around for a number to seven to nine

Laurie\nHey I missed the first party else program because I work for an animal shelter and I was right working with animals but so\nJust kind of pick up on the topic but I just wanted to say that after the Kavanaugh thing I Want to put it away from people think a lot of people think that if you voted for Trump figure racist you're ... you're homophobic here this year that\nOn your anti feminine what a ... and moving blah blah blah and now if you were pro Kavanaugh you are I'm desperately anti survivor of sexual assault and I just want to make is real clear women\nThat were the demonstrators as we can make women like me furious because I Am a survivor of sexual assault\nI'm from a little girl and um and and\nThey're here here's the deal you don't have to hate men you don't have to and and they act like like men are the devil you know and play\nAnd that bothered me really really bad because I'm like I said just getting my feet wet and politics I'm going to pay very close attention to this election coming up in November and get my information but I Know who I'm voting for what they stand for\nWhen you get that information right here on the news\nAnd I know 'cause I was going to ask you all like a tough thing but I Do want to say I don't I'm not sure what the topic was the day but\nI re seven inner city kid I'm In Tampa, Florida on and all seven of them or I'm Dominican Haitians and ... a Jamaican I'm Jewish Jewish Puerto Rican and Puerto Rican um I they called me they're white momma and um\nI don't not real sure where things were funny 'cause I didn't hear it but I couldn't be more proud of their kids and I mean I Lived on a little small town right outside of Tampa and they were the only black kids in the community and people looked at I sideways in the grocery store and I wasn't raised that way\nUm I went to predominantly black schools when I was a child because\nI mean I just wear my we were zone for\n'em and\nBut I just I don't understand it I don't think if you're a black man and woman I'm\nYoung person today in two thousand Eighteen the only thing holding you back with the yourself because I think truly even though I'm I'll leave the unnamed president unnamed who started\nA race racial divide that I thought was a you know pretty much gone for a long time uh started up again but um I just thought we were passed\nWas really good question off topic yes who work at the animal shelter is Montgomery Elmore county okay I got a dog from the shelter for a year ago but I don't know is background can deal\nDogs are brought in and they have an\nIntake card and I'm going to tell you something he sometimes he never know what the hell they banned parade um\nAnd and then that you know the hell are waiting for someone awesome like you to come in and adopt down and they you know they can come in and I got that foster children and they come with each other you know and now all I can say is alive at the end patient and just creating a new reality for them\nOver time there's there's some of them that they'll still have those little if he's\nUm but they get better three time but I mean honestly I have a slew of animals myself and all of them are rescue 'em and\nI don't even I don't know all their stories and it would probably or if I tell my story you know\nMom basically trying to figure out how ... you know ... years\nThat have um like I said well okay now now\nThat can like AT T and keeping a pocket knife and how they are\nOkay Laurie we appreciate it so much a number to seven to nine to to make random\nOr this or off color wrote about it what you're talking about the economy but because some of the about about your own kids and how the lingo is it's it's as simple because I'm not even the even kill them at this for three years I mean they're not being told oh well maybe we\nMaybe they learn they hadn't learned and lay their life and that takes a ... a little note for the person I knew from some of them one on the Cuba\nWas read these saying is that's not true they just choose not turning on and turn it off\nA marine who ... who had a tall black\nOh yeah I've heard is lower than a million times and and as a ... ... ...\nBut I'm saying they don't want to know why they get hurt in the not so much\nAnd and and I was told to dodge it about why liberal women padding in the end and doctors but you know the ... the ... the ... and and and and the key is the whole is around ... go\nOut there but on the economy I don't want to say about Selma and about the uh about the economy um my mom I work out a lot\nAnd she was one of the crazy ones the hip train and moved the whole company to Mexico and and she said the scope for a whole year training and then people do take the jobs go away but\nBut she just she ... she would lose a good thing is is that time she needed money and she thought the\nCoast guard open open and they did and that was five hundred employees and then you had the big orange shop I mean everybody wanted to the crime as you put money back and people ... the the crime is going to take a kid it's the same thing about growing up where I Am in people ... and I mean you just can't see it right I mean\nDiamonds are either lose diamonds or or diamonds in settings that you're not going to wear any more take those mothers well he can give you a price on those that's where he finds the

to have a question you pundits about the house of representatives race but at the state okay [noise] okay at the intersection of Mac or more road in the Atlanta hat way there is a poster a big one for that lady named added ... yeah and\nThat was ... I saw her Saturday Night at a ...\nRight well it says she's an independent no straight party ticket voting but she's running for Alvin home sleep isn't that right that's correct okay wow what her picture be over here on the Atlanta ally in the middle of the matrix elites those districts [noise]\nOne of a couple of things um is it like a big for by the time George\nIs a great big one was her picture looks good she looks good the letter as good as well done it's it's sad that placed on the corner was ...\nWell it probably a property owners they gave ... sign yeah but it's probably a couple of reasons is at a district one is you have an overzealous a supporter who doesn't know where the district lines are that happens a lot of second reason is that's a well traveled cornered or for all of them are going yeah\nUh and and people in and outside of that district travel in a down that court or so it's possible that she just was looking for some good name id in that area\nOkay well it it's been there for weeks and I I figured you guys might have an idea why\nThe the unfortunate ... the unfortunate problem is it's been there for weeks because right now is when you put your science out you know about a month or the election\nIf you put them out too early people forget that they're they look past and by the time election day rolls around are now is the time you know three I I'm not a big proponent of science anyway but if you're going to waste your money on science do it for weeks before the election\n[noise] All right well thank God that was pretty ...\nIn yeah if you put them out too early to use a little change some mischief sometimes they walk off yes I've seen signs actually grow feet and move\nHow ... I've lost overnight I I've watched him jumping to my car [laughter] [laughter] oh\nI've seen signs jumped into my car not because I Want to use\nRights those are actually\nHandy for more than campaigns are usually in the last couple of days of the campaign\nI might go snag one or two of them you can use them to go down hills like on a sled or there's no shortage of things you can do this for my ... what I like to do is get a little square and pillow ... some water yeah they are starting to shoot among the sign she got to be ... ...\nSquare ... got to get a good one got to get a super so ... yeah oh you didn't say super saying you can ruin a sign you can ruin a sign of bleach or gasoline [laughter] and I'm at\nAnd I'm asked her yelling fire hit it and it was a super so gr and then come back later and do that you know I was ... just like a a legal basis maybe it's a homeowners' association thing\nIf I say you know wanted to put out a big signs saying\nI Love the any the yoga and I do that legally just any out on the street they're still in my yard like political sons are yeah and it cannot buy like McDonalds yeah he yeah but somebody so knock on your door and say that's a trash each of the neighborhood taken now and the political signs are\nYeah they are um but but political speech gets a priority in this country\nOver commercial vats what's wrong with it that's what's wrong with this country political speeches by already violent political speech where we get the bully each other because I have more people on my side gets a priority as opposed to a peaceful voluntary commercial speech that's correct\nThat's why this country so full of crap\nIf you've got your own show to tough it out [laughter]\nTo make my own hours selling about\nI'm just up and somebody bleachers you're saying don't come crying to me I've ... I've already seen those signs\nAll the time though this this home being remodeled by her by that kind of stuff so you do see some of those commercials scientist says\nHere's the reality here is that you know political science don't work ... if they worked you've already name some giant corporations who would put them out Pepsi Coca Cola McDonalds right the reason you don't see those signs on the side of the road is because they don't work if they work they would put them out\nNow let me take him let me differ with you know many\nPeople that are not politically aware who will go vote but they a lotta times don't know who they're voting on because if you're running for auditor you're not going to raise enough money to have a TV ad okay so so if you're driving down the highway and you see Jones auditor\nYou might when you go vote for auditor you may only know the name Jones and you'll vote because you've seen that sign but in races that are a little more high profile they don't work\nSo I don't think they work in a row whatever banned by pissed off of the best part of the eyes of the best part of science is Tyrone sales in dollars it shuts up your client\nYour candidate will shut up you know keep them occupied he'll run all over the district putting up signs he doesn't call you he doesn't ask you questions they just put up signs in a case of occupy now he's wasting his time and he's lessening the chance of winning\nBecause if you end up losing by say three hundred votes and you spent twenty hours putting up signs you could have gone and met three hundred people in twenty hours and ... and you don't have to be three hundred it's meant to hundred and fifty and change if you could have met and twenty hours you're going to conversations with a hundred and fifty but I just met him\nAt actual conversations in the door in their place of business and they want to and then you but but then they put up you know and not only that they spent like six grand on these size ten grand twenty grand some of these campaigns and they said that that could have been a TV spot that could have been radio that could have been real things that actually work\nSo if you if you insist on signs if you insist on science I say to\nGrand blow it on all the little stupid dinky stuff that doesn't work\nAnd give it to an overzealous supporters were insisting on this dinky stuff that doesn't work and let them deal with it and you go out and meet people and when I'm just among the first moment a candidate himself is actually putting a sign on the ground he's already admitted defeat he just sitting around waiting to see the results election night\nOr no I'm just making sure the legality of things like say we got signs that said listen to news interviews from nine to noon or listen to the Joe ... why do we get business cards up through yet about Seinfeld\nBut just got people who are fans who is there's going to put them up in their yard now I'm back chew some homeowners association if not there's already a municipal code which say you can't do that\nBut you can add on my home and I drive a property Mars why homeowners' association is not let me put a political campaigns on the ... which part of any political stuff\nYou know let them and you know what I tell you own your product is what I tell candidates all the time I voluntarily sign up for them yeah you're gonna get signs\nYou need to find one person and not your cell and that is their whole job is to keep up with who want science and making sure those people get science and when they get tone up make sure those sounds get replaced but don't you do the first\nTime the candidate is out there wasting a Saturday putting science center wasted valuable afternoon but ... they've already lost the race and you can you can tell your candidate is all day long\nThey will inevitably be out there punching signs at some point they will I mean it's just inevitable they will do it you will tell them you're going to lose this was a waste of money this is just just stopped doing it and get out of there and do something else go meet somebody and they will not listen they just won't listen how much do those signs cost\nAbout three three and bugs person yeah\nYeah 'cause now they got those yesterday to know you got to get everything and\nUm let's do this a cornerstone managing general agency Greg rent and his team over there over a hundred and eighty years in business a hundred and eighty years in excuse me not business they just opened a few months ago hundred eighty years of experience\nGet them at your place three five ... she'll get the number right actually I don't want to give you the wrong number or make sure you get cornerstone M.

I left handed pitcher throat or writing it it it is designed to for Kavanaugh to put things out of the park\nYou know he's expected to make a big difference in terms of this switch votes from Kennedy on criminal cases environmental cases executive power cases environment no these are all on the docket\nAn actor Oscar to see people moving abortion cases affirmative action cases quickly through the system\nThat's going to be the case is that the stuff that's already there it's the stuff that's going to get there there's going to have to go through the uh the appellate process\nAnd I think the way that they're going to test this as they go into states are going to be doing well saying that\nYou cannot have a an abortion at a certain time for him say X number of weeks because science has changed so much in the in the world the medicine that you can detect fetal heartbeat soon it movement and the three day the sun and grammar or\nPretty impressive they didn't have that with my two children coming on but I've seen them and they're very very impressive so does the tour to kind of comes over the intuition viewpoint and it's changing the court from nine to Nineteen\nBecause you've got nine justices you can't ever have a tie however you have written about a proposal where because the number of justices on the Supreme Court is not mandated by the U.S constitution you would like to see this Supreme Court has nine teen explain that\nWell I I did a study many years ago that really concluded that nine as possibly one of the worst numbers you can have we've the smallest court of any large nation by the fact that we have nine justices is really an accident and we used to add a justice when we added a circuit\nAnd we ended up with nine but ever since we did that we've had the problem of a divide chord with one swing justice\nNineteen members would dilute the power of these justices and every time we have a confirmation the whole republic wouldn't seem to be resting and the balance we might be able to have a confirmation\nThat looks on someone's credentials and they're just prudential views how do you measure it wasn't a change in Congress could change the constitution does not set the number and they can increase is under my plan would occur over many years\nOr so that no justice would have all of those seats but he was finally have a court about the size of other nations\nAnd these justices would not hold so much concentrated power\nAre you suggesting Nineteen thinking that maybe you would be on the list [laughter]\nWhy you think we have come about Nineteen hundred before they reach a point on the west but yeah\nThat's an interesting concept to add Dan ... when you do look at it the Supreme Court's in a lot of countries such as you may have a much larger body\nHave so much gravity towards one area I don't think and then it would be who would be in charge and you would have to do it in twos until you got to unite tea and maybe do it break it up or every eight years something like that that well yeah because\nThere was the whole FDR ... were saying she don't want one president ... gone to\nHis international policy type things but he has seemed to have found himself and have become the new Lindsey Graham assistant in\nSenator hesitate to get into as after that conversation with but from kind of I think a view generally as happy political warrior but I gotta say over the last couple of weeks and you have seemed angry and I guess I'm\nI'm questioning what has gotten so much on New Year's I wanted to take a look at and Lindsey Graham over the last couple of weeks here you are\nThis is the ... and the ethical\nSince I've been in politics I thought she was handled\n[noise] I have an al was treated like crap\nWhy are you well now you're seeing happening but why are you will ever have you been on the happy warrior these couple of weeks I'm happy because the effort to nearly eight and railroad a man I've known for Twenty years and it's never been banned from ...\nI'm happy that those who tried to destroy his life fell short\nI'm Glad those who tried to overturn the rule of law and replace it with ... last I've never been more tests than my life I voted for so tomorrow and Kagan our never done this to them this character assassination [laughter] this is warning power too much to the extent that I came to the age of this good man\nAnd help the fate this debacle I'm happy\nAs a class [noise] different that's a different Lindsey Graham and what do you do is he's taking that humor and he's adding kind of forced fullness and authority to\nAgree I didn't expect based on the conversation wherever before this clip of him to go and I'd a man I've known for Tony gears who's never been banned from a mall and more though it was like whoa whoa\nWhoa they're Lindsay and he's he's got this edge to work that's very happy to through witty here um I I don't know how new Lindsey is in terms of policy but in terms of how he's presenting himself as defending the Republican boarded defending the president very Lindsey to board up\nReally I mean I I\nI think is great and as we progress through this uh these clips I think the audience was so you're too now I I kinda went back and he he really found instead of doing this coming over here he's probably going to be the chair a judicial\nCommittee which I think will be a great place for him to be you know they could bring some grab a ties to that as a little different than Grassley I think he's going to be much more\nActive versus more conciliatory which is ... he was doing and I think he's going to I'm trying to meet with the Democrats and and um and get them kind of ... different things but he did say something in here\nThat it kind of surprised me he's going to go out and campaigned against some of his colleagues assistant in\n... ad tell you something that may not make you happier bring it up\nBecause it appears the cabinet confirmation is not going to end us fight that democratic congressman Gerry ... at\nA New York who would if the Democrats take the house but come the house judiciary chairman has already talked about launching an investigation into alleged misconduct by Kavanaugh Nancy Pelosi says she wants to see the FBI\nInterviews and the second background check it it doesn't sound like this is going to ask well\nIs a while now and November at that makes sense I Hope everybody running for the house and these purple districts all asked will be asked a question do sport in teaching judge Kavanaugh based on five allegations that none of which could be cooperated [noise] do you want an outcome so badly that she would basically turned the law upside down\nA all I can say is that this is going to the strength at the ballot box or I'm going to have I'm never campaigned against a colleague in my life that's about to change I'm gonna go throughout this country and let people on these fat you know purple states are red states where Trump won\nNot what I thought you know what I think about this process\nThat's a that's big and Lindsey because he has kind of gotten this celebrity status when this this speech city did\nI think he is going to be very affected so imagine him an Indian talking to that good I think he would Montana North Dakota doesn't need to go there he didn't he probably won't go to West Virginia 'cause mentioned voted for\nKevin Oh how about Missouri\nAnd then go into Texas to really put up a Ted Cruz which I don't think they just popping up but in this kind of a Democrat wish\nList I'm I'm starting to think politically here is Lindsey Graham's was late fifties early sixties oh look at it but I think that's correct\nTrump's going to be running again but even as long as he stays in the Senate\nBut gets in the conversation of overeating make a great secretary his day care he would\nPump aim needs to do other things now we're talking about I have a ... how bout attorney general attorney general yes he gets even if he doesn't get one of those positions he gets in those conversations he becomes even me he's already a national figure but now he's kind of changed his tune\nI think Lindsey Graham wants to be president and you've got to think about these things long term I think he wants to be president let's go to the bones are going to Cooper Cooper was on board today Moshe\nHey Dan oh he's sixteen to rely on about ... ...\n... Lindsey Graham is sixty three\nOh oh the young yet [laughter] so I'm an older than sixty do as a um [noise] I'm going to go on a limb here you go to\nA doctor for ... for in a pressure or other group plan to change or does the morning when\nAll and I think there's going to be a lot more research on this I think she's going to turn out to be the mastermind of ... but\nThat who's going to be the mastermind\nThe the ... FBI and the poor coach how to take a lie detector is that they were together when the letter was written in\nModeling yes ... yeah okay the female okay yeah I think she's going to be the one who cooked up this\n... this Robin and I I don't I don't think the event that happened of course all politicians are scared to death for you that you know you might believe that they say it so\nWell I Hope they get to the polygraph thing number one hopes somebody will you know going from baritone or something like that [noise] goes in and talks to Ford and she kind of ... somethings who\nYou know what happens is if if he has a pass said is liberal leaning that will come out [noise] [noise] oh I think a lot\nAbout um I I think a lot more is going to come out ... I I think they're I think they maybe don't really it would not be necessary for this letter to ever come out because she said I Want to keep it private and all that\nThey might have thought you know we can get him out of contention without even having never go public with it and it may be it blew up in their face but I I think ... McLean is going to be deeply involved in the\nCity I think the opposite of that I think they wanted it to be publicized I think the whole point was trying to ... to ... back to go to make Kevin Oh look bad and under the ... and here's the key\nIf she could pass a law detector test then she was believable so that's all she knew she didn't have to have anything else we her boyfriend said yeah she tone McClain who she was when they were hoping to me\nHow to do this for her and be a thing and so you notice she says the letter and then why before she's going home she goes and takes a lot of detector test at a hotel and a Baltimore\nYeah well I'll tell you one I think it's going to happen\nI think there's going to be a lot of people that haven't been her from now that the confirmation there's over we're I think some more people are gonna start spilling the beans mopping\nNo no I I think something's gonna happen too and it's like I said friday ... and I hate to say this but\nIn the second door on the wider tractor and things like that yeah so it's going to because they're so specter this out there and if we get down to the bottom of the truth comes out then Kevin to regain credibility\nYeah and I think a lot of people they were afraid\nBring up things like you know are mostly on the Internet it knows what's true on the Internet but that this ... model of her house was done years before she met with the\nA psychologist or whatever who brought these memories out and so you all this stuff's gonna come out then it was ... I think there were afraid to say anything about it before the confirmation because no one wanted to look like they heaven forbid\nDidn't believe her yeah I think we will\nYou're a woman hater or gay rights as if you don't believe this\n\nDannemora show [noise]\n[noise]\n\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center says is W.

newest justice of the Supreme Court is that all talk or is there some substance there\nWell that's the question when the fight was going they said that if Kavanaugh confirmed they would continue their investigation into these allegations of teen age drinking and sexual misconduct and the question is where they just venting where they just caught up emotionally at the time\nOr do they really intend to do this but what they have to do to do that would be to win one house of Congress at least a next month the polls don't look right for them and the Senate but they do look good for them to win

politically apolitical\nIs a change for Swiss [noise]\nDon't know what really caused that but\nIt was that is on your little she lose your mouth shut and she said\nThat um that but I burn terrifies assistant into a chose gr talking about a\nMineral lessons have publicly voice my political opinions they feel very differently about that now as much as I have in the past and we'd like to continue voting for women in office I cannot support Marsha Blackburn she's a Republican her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me why do you think Taylor Swift out of nowhere\nDecided to get pulled over I I this is where I used to love about Taylor Swift she stayed away from politics is all about music all about you know female empowerment look she says the more I learn about Marsha Blackburn is record in Congress I Can't support it was maybe she should actually learn about her record in Congress\nBeing a co sponsor of bills that stopped human trafficking sponsoring bills that was stopped the flow of drugs and opioids in the state of Tennessee against domestic abuse stone and so forth it's it's rather edited and clear that\nI don't I don't want to accuser this but I don't think she was the only one that wrote that posted on Instagram she probably got some very bad information and then look is part of this narrative where celebrities that want to do good in the world I Would give her the benefit of good intentions are being told that people like Marsha Blackburn are horrible people and nothing could be further from the truth in the final thing is\nWhen he was governor huge allegations of covering up you know sexual misconduct in his administration when he was governor of ... a reporter by the Associated Press\nSomeone who was the kind of effect is has ... fans does this matter to you because she's been she really has been a political and she's when you're talking country music ... and that base particularly the Nashville kind of do that that's a different mindset\nI I Know I tried to make the ever when say it's a ... musician I like er a comedian I like if they pose something that I disagree with politically I tried to just go well what the hell like I you know whatever as long as it's not always in my face I tried to just separate those world\nUm but I think with Taylor especially given where she came from and she got her start in country music as you said\nA she this is why she's been a political like during the presidential race she was very quiet right\nBecause we're fine fan base is basically come support well and somebody who is from the country music tradition of did this and did a very well is Dolly Parton she's constantly been asked I think he was even as the last presidential elections like I'm not getting into that honey\nNot getting into that I don't do that I'm trying to make everybody happy\nAnd you know it's I think it's up to each artists each actor musician whatever it's you're famous here celebrities do with\nWhat you wish but uh I think the best strategy if you wanted to make most people happy as just give your give people what they want while you're pop it in the first place which is great music ... music and I just\nProducing that Tennessee environment is like you know you don't need to tell us what to do an ad for example the country music awards when they started getting a little political ... out there they were they got some serious blow back on that serious but\nI think we make a mistake because their their argument is somebody like Taylor Swift has such a huge platform there is a moral responsibility to speak up for what you believe that but I think we make a mistake sometimes when whether it's a Senate election or what not to quite voting for somebody with like\nSome moral principles so if you voted for Kavanaugh you're a rape apologist or something like that and I think that as long as you're in your motives huge mistake or is it even that you are you don't want a woman's right to to Susan Collins does Susan Collins made whole speech on the floor\nI think it's just it's more complicated than bumper sticker and hashtags campaigns and for that is what Taylor Swift should know if she's going to be political just know that for complicated and do you really feel this wife so they're celebrities\nYeah I mean how long you can do whatever you want is just a question isn't going to have some type of blowback particularly when you say there's somebody in particular is terrified versus are you looking at the political consequences of that we're a Democrat that was hitting that said what were terrified of you about the Democrats or anything\nYou know and what exactly is terrified\nRight like I don't know\nIt's going to get so much information from Twitter\nAbsolutely amazing it is I'm\nThat way seems to be doing pretty well and I I Will be curious to see because of polling data that just came out and that was from last week was a second to the fifth and had the wayside at five percent from the CBS\nThough that is ... and their new tourists lay off they're notoriously low on the Republican numbers because when you look at the ... of it they outweigh Democrats two Republicans and they basically equal way independence nests\nWe're Republicans are a little bit\nAh tore it just a little bit ahead of the Democrats in that's those are the facts that are there in anybody's looking at that because that's what it but why couldn't you research was so affected protected in getting the intention level so stay with Tony Curtis um tennis Web hit her political move here\nOn the very latest Fox News poll shows that are um Blackburn is actually a hand of at least before the Taylor Swift endorsement by five points but I Wonder\nCharlie if telescope realizes that she is endorsing a Phil Bredesen who endorsed Brett\nKavanaugh correct right I don't think she's able to draw that distinction look tendency to become a deep red state\nAnd the other thing is President Trump is why it's so popular in Tennessee he just did another rally there which I think is going to only grow you know the margin even further and the final thing is this women under the Trump Administration are doing better than ever the lowest unemployment for women and sixty years wages are going up\nBusiness startups for young women are at record high so look Taylor Swift I Love your music\nPersonally Kanye West I'm a bigger fan of his I Wish you would have not done this way with politics and you know at the very end of her Instagram post she talked about how tomorrow\nIs going to be the deadline for registering it looks like it's an effort to get out the vote but the big question is are the people\nWho do vote on the at the midterms well anybody be impacted by what tell us when I was at that will be interesting look she has an amazing amount of cultural caught without a doubt an unbelievable falling in well deserved by the way\nI I just wish there would have been some some form of neutrality when she went about this where she said just register to vote make an informed decision that would have been the proper way to go about this instead she said Marsha Blackburn is against el GDP Marsha Blackburn balance right oh well let me give me a break that is ridiculous\nAnd anyone who knows congresswoman Blackburn has worked with her like I have no that is so far from the truth she will be a wonderful United States senator from Tennessee you know protecting the country and are supporting the president's agenda\nNuts it the professors and that's where we're having a when whenever I hear this talk generated\nIs from people who do not understand the foundation and the formation\nOf our country and the importance of US Senators to the equation of representation for the state we had the discussion that's why they talking about it used to be that the house and Senate of legislature which led US Senators and um then we went to direct vote\nAnd that had some good things to it as the bad things have it has more participation and such but um\nIt's certainly changed the equation without a doubt\nAnd I think there are a lot of people who've really bought into the mists of democracy is always good and what more democratic the better little D Democrat where\nEverybody gets to vote and I think I mean I agree with writers one of my favorite lines is democracy theoretically kills the thing that loves\nLiberty because you often get majorities in in their whims of the moment or power hungry desires they get rid of people's liberties those are the minority the smallest minority being out of the individual\nAnd the founders understood that so you need some democracies others some say so things don't get picked up with an elite running everything\nBut you do need the and that's exactly what the Senate was presented as the house can be this you know\nFor all let's habit where the state legislatures are picking centers again and then let's have a house of representatives that actually\nRepresents the populations so district\nThere was no increase the number wasn't there a limit on how many people could be in the house where you know just expand that make it a crazy free for all going for ... and I tend to the Supreme Court yeah exactly know what happens if you need a ... with a thousand people in the house of representatives fine\nAnd the Senate where the real is it gets done\nWell then if you do if you expand the house than you I think he would have more representation I think the same because of quote Jeremiah injury and death I think it gets to play but here's the thing about it on that purpose as that you would never have had a senator Jeremiah Denton elected in Nineteen Ninety\n... election Nineteen eighty because one of the way I can carry a distaste so strongly that it carried over and got Jeremiah Denton to become US Senator same thing with I'm madly in Georgia\nGeorgia was a democratic state would not have had him he would not have had Hawkins from Florida because Florida was a democratic state\nState legislature wise but Reagan carrot is so strong that carried Hawkins ... Hawkins and to the U.S Senate and so those were tore that she would not elected somebody before there was a Republican and boom you're headed with the Democrat\nHouse and Senate seats and they are because you remember ... published didn't take charge and two two thousand and twelve wrote it go to those ... I'm Sorry\nIt was the post Obama in ...\nAnd that's when you had the majority of Republicans ... ... so it it changes the dynamics but we're\nIf somebody is now representing the state as much as they represent in their view point a to point to John McCain present he's representing his the military industrial complex type ... things who maybe are becoming\nMore elitist older I get the more older I get the more I watch like politics and the less I'm very skeptical of democracy that would be on the side of\nWould be careful how much we put up for a vote doesn't necessarily mean something's true are good because a lot of them either where the public has voted yes just because something is popular doesn't mean it's right in\nGood ... and [noise] and they they've citizens are winning with such little information is is my problem but you also and we said on the show launched you also have a lot of legislators\nThat have ... or ... and they just they're just not smart enough and we've had several of them on the on the show\nEighty four handy for how you doing brother\nHey I'm doing good how are you doing really well\nGood good I I I liked it scares in your happened because people don't understand the way that the the country was actually founded and added ... that the founding fathers were smarter than we are now\nI I Wish we would go back to the states nominating senator because what what that would do is if the states were taken our senators and if you try and like Jay was they had I think it was originally thirty five every thirty five thousand people had a congressman\n... what happens is the state but the standards are up there nothing gets done in the house because everybody's fight\nI Will then your personal state congressman which is only thirty five thousand people\nThere that you can go to them and ... if not you go back to your state legislature it's a lot easier for me to talk to reading room\nOr they breed biker and say hey why did you put this Yahoo we end up there's a you know as our state senator and if I don't like it is easier for me to vote him out\nYeah it wouldn't have the other side of the ... when you look at their Jeremiah Denton discussion is wondering would have done as it were made this staged legislature look more like you vote on presidential elections\nWell in but see it's the ... I've got a different I've got a different opinion of that uh you like the Jeremiah Denton got voted in because you're a Republican and which\nYou know I I have a bad as whale however if if you had voted Democrat and you didn't want the Yahoo that they put up there and you say hey man I'm not voting for you next time you're more responsible when it's somebody you have to look at a uh\nWhere where this one I was saying the same thing I I'm I'm saying when where you have a big impact and turn it back in Nineteen sixty four when you go water sweep of the sudden change\nI mean he won he won Alabama bigtime boat in three members of Congress within wow\nI mean that was shown almost part of the U.S senator with it oh so so when it did as if he was in time that Senate see ... to ... that President and party wanted he will soon have changed Democrat is a lot earlier than you did\nIn the state legislature\nAnd I still think we should go back to know how it was originally written up I was I I I learned a great lesson in elementary school ... podunk little up or a cat and may not even one of the quote on quote real prob them out\nOut there but we had a teacher I was either but wants her fifth right\nShe gave us a little chance she got a pop quiz does she does okay we're going to have a boat or it it is is Warner to all the boys get off frame or all the girls get operate every body boat\nAnd it come down as he or she went through the whole process nearby she goes okay all the girls get asked her I Know the boys do\nAnd it's like well that's not fair to the ... democracy is not fair that's why we don't live in a new democracy we live in a representative republic ha explained it to us and and you understand that there has to be that representation and for this crazy warm up there to get rid\nOf the electoral college is that that's just ask them that they're really that is just I mean it's it's it's ... yeah I guess if you live in New York City sure\nYou would like to get rid of it because then you can run the whole country one spot but then the whole country can go to crap hey what's the biggest bank than California the whole country and go just this into a big pile of grab the California they\nYeah and there'll be leading the way I was like the concept of democracy is when a too will soon as she decide what's for dinner ...\nBags act like a way out of the good work and don't ask about the ball game Diane\nI didn't I didn't say I was feeling you paint a buddy\nI I heard yeah I I heard your girl [laughter]\nAh middle income and don't ask you about the ball game oh my lord oh my lord you know you don't keep up the good work thanks for hours down dressed in pushing your friendship just don't enjoy doing one they're more show will be back right after this\n[noise] see all\nThis [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nAnd we are\nIn Dannemora show [noise]\nTurn on the news\nTalk Ninety three point wanted found [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nChevrolet Master control centers says is W.

there is a growing mystery surrounding the disappearance of a Saudi journalist who's been critical of Saudi Arabia is powerful crown prince Washington Post contributor democracy Yogi vanished in

Arabia denies that it mud or abducted has shown vi and officials even allow journalists inside the consulate in an attempt to prove that he is not too bad\nNow Jamal has shown he had spoken out against the Saudi Government and its powerful crown prince Mohammed bin and fell non condemning a lack of free speech and the ultraconservative Islamic state onto the crown prince Saudi Arabia has

congressman Devin even as he is chairman of the house intelligence committee and this will now Brett Kavanaugh will start his new job the eyes were pretty soon next week out on the Supreme Court reaction to what is taking place this weekend will\nTell you it really shows the divide between what you have in Washington DC and New York city and that whole beltway and all the big cities in America\nBuying into this mob mentality of opposing Supreme Court justice nominees for apparently no reason in contrast Maria I've been out here in in the rural part of California in my district for the last week\nAnd I cannot go anywhere to any coffee shop any grocery store\nAnywhere without somebody bringing up judge Kavanaugh and how upset they are not only by what they're doing to him and his family but also by the behavior of politicians and it looks like total chaos in Washington DC when really the opposite is true we've never had it so good in this country\nAnd I wanted to echo that it was amazing the amount of the conversation and we'll cabinet churches today\nAnd I know a couple of federal judges and their comments to me about this we're really something very pleased that Kevin O's on the bench but the attorneys have then I Know within the church\nThey were just appalled by the way Kevin O's being treated and what does it come to this kind of went to the point was\nAnd they feel even though we don't have anything to stay here but I think we were just going to get a boat just sort of just to kind of 'cause they go live some steam and put some action on this and the question is would they be doing that in Texas and Florida and\nTennessee and places like that at the end to the sea level that we're really hoping for\nOkay so new news is going to go on who's gonna be talking about the protests and what they're getting out of it\nWhen you look at the outcome is that the president has had a they'd been very positive from economic to see the uh the judge naming sell you get cells as\nWell as well as obviously the Supreme Court but didn't they just seem to hate coming from the laugh I mean Susan Collins loaded obviously very important to get her vote to confirm Kavanaugh she's been flooded with abusive Twain op threatening\nViolence to Susan Collins we we've seen the protesters continuing when\nThings go from here congressman given the level of have an upset on her lap and shaming tactics\nTill I think this is what you've been seeing for the last two years it's been it's been done to the president of United States who got a bunch of billionaires working with the fake news media and the Democratic party to bring up\nHoaxes fake news stories they rile up their base and they and now you have a whole bunch of Americans out there who believe things that just aren't true\nWith what you've seen with all these crazy protests a new one actually act what are you protesting about\nThey can't answer the question\nRight and you cover this every day on your show uh the economy's doing well the military is being rebuilt trade agreements are ... are getting done\nWhat do you see in the ... what are they protesting nobody understands that's why out in the real America paper like what what the heck is going on there and and that's why I say what what you saw happen\nReally awesome down to this\nComing home uh for November So really been the strategy that that they are Democrats employed or has backfired so I\nDon't see any way that they have another thing that's going to stretch out for another four weeks\nAnd well because it's hard to keep that at that level of intensity up there and it was if you look at it and it really was the protesters and people watching the protesters and watching the actions of the Democrats that in their\nStates sitting in the in the living room watching that on television they considered the sofa and get outraged you didn't take any energy or they they just got out and that basically it was happening\nBut there's nothing in there for them to go that way because I was going to kind of banish enlisted stupidly will go out and really start trying to and here's the pitcher\nYou saw them scratching at the doors and pony that the doors of the Supreme Court have you ever been to the Supreme Court those doors are these like thirty foot high metal door loser is ludicrous where they were trying to do\nBut if you get more of that you get more people saying you know says it brings a court that are gearing a cabinet oh\nThen I think that's going to get him back onto the purpose of the Senate is to advise and consent and there's was that she can destroy and then there's a legitimate argument is out there\nBut then as we're going to get into a little bit extra in the show then we've got some other things are going to be happy\nAnd that may put him over the top there's going to the phones to go to David David with us today more ship\nOh Dave I'm Sorry yeah state yeah how are you I'm doing good David new\nGoing just fine love your program always love your program will thank you talk about this whole thing going on to me it it really seems fairly obvious to a point that\nThat's all that's going on about the counting our hearings in the in the obvious ... actions that some of the Democrats don't you think it's just a diversion of against the whole concept of the deep state that that's going on\nYou know or the other investigations and having to do with the department of justice than the last ... minutes ration and all that\nYou were saying that the Democrats are doing this as a tack to to get to that\nYeah I think to to take the fall off because it's just I blocked it that that so many of these things are are coming up in and out the protesters and paid protesters an agitator and the mob rule it just seems like it's too much with NATO\nAnd the and I think that that very simple one but go ahead and take the focus off the whole state issue that's really going on that\nThat's really trying to be hidden and and now I'm just really concerned for this whole country\nWell we were to get into that part of the equation but I I think it is what it is and that is they were trying to do everything they could to do well Kevin Oh because they're not going to do well the uh the department of justice and the inspector general's report and I think we're going to see a piece of that this week\nI think there's going to be some information if there's going to come out there's going to get it out there and paper and go oh my gosh\nBut it would probably lead or part of this week managed letter part of the week\nBut my it'll be great that'll be great here I hadn't heard that before the uh there was something in pending that come on and I don't\nKnow you and I hear justice being done here you you heard it first word\nWhy thank you very much appreciate it again great program\nThanks Dave appreciate you took them go nukem words others continue on with the Democrats action against Kevin Oh and Trump postings were the backbone of\nInteresting because we have a poll looking at intensity and interest in the midterms Democrats in July were already pretty high or anti Trump Seventy percent\nIn October that's gone up a little bit after Kavanaugh but for the Republicans a bigger spreads July sixty percent interested in the midterms October it's now up to eighty percent as you can see even more intense than the Democratic side what does that tell you about what came out of the Kavanaugh nomination fight\nThat tells me that Senator Feinstein and Schumer really really screwed up friday they had an opportunity to continue with the wind and ... a ... a towards victory and and November and they and they blew it they absolutely ...\nWell the Democrats\nLot of Democrats look at the president said he's not presidential\nKeep in mind he was not a politician before but many of them consider having a child how\nDid they continuously undermining underestimate that's private and look at the economy yeah [noise]\nWell I'll tell you when the person from past or or announced a new NAFTA the U.S embassy a church that really\nWas tremendous thing for a lot of Democrats to look at because what he basically did is he ...

denied it I think he might be out next Monday to one so ... what the last time I get into a review of that movie a little bit but are joining me tonight and there's that southern border\nAnd in half how do you get into the whole thing do what you you\nI think I Do a decent job no I don't I don't get very many\n... generally if somebody gets pissed off about something I say it's because I said it on purpose and they didn't know I was joking about it and that really just really just ... me up when I hear that I'm like yes it was convincing\nBut just be yourself in don't over analyze if you want to call and say something call and say it\nYet ... mayor sounds stupid sure it might where I've said lots has all but the thing I was ... and\nI just said stupid crap few minutes ago\nBut you just keep doing it and but the biggest key is just be yourself right and if if your yourself is like what a\nDog down I was trying to think of his ... he said he said if you've never tell a lie you've never have to remember what you say it ... it just be yourself you don't have to act in a different just say what you mean and sometimes you know what sometimes people are going to disagree with\nHim at all you need to get it out and you know even after you're saying that maybe I shouldn't of but actually I should of just think out loud I needed to say that to get that off my chest so it could be corrected or could be refined and a certain way and there's one thing I wanted to really get at here\nMy trouble these days because I have I listened back last week the week before and I feel like at times I'm all over the place because at the end of the day I often the biggest thing I'm always fighting\nWhat I'm trying to present a show or just go through daily life is boredom\nLike maybe it runs in the family or something I'm On I think my mom was like there is not so much with the boredom but with boredom disappointment like things don't live up to the expectations in your mind\nSo like when I'm watching the cabinet live as we speak as being ceremony only a ceremonial that he's being sworn in things that the White House right now speaking right whatever [noise]\nBut it's like okay I knew the stay was going to come\nGo when that first statement from Diane Feinstein came out to\nYou know so we have a letter and this person is Iran confidential but the FBI will investigate I knew as soon as I saw that all the actors all persons name and identity will be late to the media won't remain confidential and I have a feeling it's gonna be something like a sexual assault delegation because it's you know me too era\nLike I kind of ... and then I was sad and disappointed\nBecause this Kavanaugh thing has struck a nerve of the nation as a shock does like shock therapy that lit up\nPolitically minded people and people that aren't even that politically minded to have a position on this and yet in the midst of this storm the shock therapy and fight over Kavanaugh and whether or not you believe cabin or you believe ... do you believe both of them in a way or\nYou think those things the circus I'm sitting there going blind mice so bored\nWhy is it that I knew this was gonna happen\nWhite and I wish I could be surprised\nBy the drama of it by people's reactions and get them like oh maybe I've been doing this too long and my ... no because I really do care\nSo it's like what what can actually get you through the day to make you feel surprised and here's what I've learned is if you keep trudging through the Monday through what you expect\nAnd you even maybe to a fault are constantly disappointed if you keep trudging through that boredom and disappointment the end of the day something does actually surprise you then you wake up one morning you check the news you know\nWhat I'm seeing that before yeah for instance you've heard of Banksy\nRight Banksy street artist\nI don't know if I have no ... is world renowned for his street art but also that he is a\nIs an anonymous fellow\nNobody knows he's so well known like his artwork is very well know\nWhere it's clever sometimes it's politically charged sometimes sometimes it's just a joke\nLike it's very well done and very clever well one of his will pieces of art\nWas sold at auction\nAs this sort of thing that surprises me and pulling up the article now\nAs they get anything he had all off now maybe he's all over the place man he's known for his pranks kind of performance art and like high brow pranks that make it go oh\nWell his latest print cost somebody over a million bucks\nYou as a prank okay\nThere's a ... version of banks these girl with a blue it's a beautiful image actually it's pretty iconic when you see it\nWell it was on the auction block friday night in one I always I\nI did hear about the way it goes through and after it somebody cast the winning bed of one point four million dollars and ... with in the paintings sounded and the campus began to pass through a shredder a paper shredder hidden in the frame\n[laughter]\nWe have talked with the successful purchaser who was surprised by the story we're in the discussion is about the next steps of the auction house Banksy himself captured the moment of shredding on Instagram with a photo caption going going gone [laughter]\nAll in out of the picture frame being shred\nCame all the way out and looked at it stay within it\nYou can see it in detail is coming out of the bottom of it in ... you know the difference livers\nWell see now that's that's just another piece of art now you've not just got the piece of art right you've got distributed piece and they come and just stick them back up\nThere then he posted a video to of how he hid the shredder within the frame and how we knew when to set it off\nIn case it was ever put up for auction how he put this whole thing together and that's I Love stuff like that is why I like ... with the ocean's eleven movies like work certain people are so intelligent they take every day convince them boredom and they just surprise you to know when\nYeah it's not just for ... years thinking three ... you're going way farther and when he constructed that whole thing he built it that way I\nI Love it when you know and to the point you just made a second ago it's worth more now it's part of our history whoever keeps those your shredded you know the different flavors of the painting will keep them together probably could be sold for\nSo now I'm part of history and when I saw that story I was like ... ever seen that before now you know I also watch a lot of ah ... yeah ... Ted Turner used to call it which some thought Ted Turner was dead\nNah me ... very much alive alive hey hey layers look bad for like the last twenty five years\nAnd I'm like what happened man he was just this driven entrepreneur and I guess he got bought out I guess the corporate world kind of true to a man he was like to hell with the ... smart move of getting out do enjoy your life enjoy your money joys of wealth you built but\nI'm pulling up and I just saw it on Instagram\nA\nWeird camera shot of this USC fight\nAnd so I watch a lot of wrestling at the last I think you see one of the big championship fights Daniel Cormier wins block listener who at the time was the WWE universal champion\nGoes into the ring and start shoving Korea a core me with jet fighter ... was was are they both kill you with their bare hands\nBut that was obviously a work as they call them the business Dana why\nAnd Vince McMahon blocked was ... I don't know if Korea was that on it or not but ... on his own do's and just getting to a U.S the cage without some of the big wigs knowing it and it really builds up anticipation that listeners may be going to come back and then a year or two\nAnd it's a smart move\nAnd a lot of people who are down on wrestling it's needs to be treated like this Banksy thing\nLike his performance art like ... Mohammed Ali did he got a lot of that from the original nature boy buddy Rogers there's wrestling is a brilliant at promotion and getting buzz and ice on what the actual prize is which is entertainment\nAnd and that would be my question about that fiasco that went over ... ... last night I don't think it's a book or is it ...

going to shift gears a little bit [noise]\nNo one's a serious thing\nNo it it has to do is what today is Columbus Day now some people want to call it indigenous peoples that half whatever my good friend um over the dance Sanchez uh-huh ah he wrote a play or wrote a piece and it's something I think he's been thinking about for a while\nUh he's really fall in love with the the comic book Superman\nLike the true I\nDidn't look Superman character or the ones like this guy there's this famous\nA comic ah edition of Superman I Can't remember where it's from a Troy sent it to me a dance and jazz and send it to me where\nIt's a young boy at the top of er of about to commit suicide is about to Joe and Superman kind of talks about a dozen ... to swoop in and catch him\nAnd the brilliance of it is with all super ... powers he doesn't force the kid and not the job and wanted him make that decision and talks to and and while I'm literally talks them down from uh the edge\nAnd Dan Sandra's point is you know Columbus\nLet's be clear folks\nColumbus if you look at the history no I was taught in school new fourteen Ninety to Columbus sale the ocean blue blah blah blah blah blah [noise] if it's fine to be critical of like so called heroes are icons eyes like especially like a guy who\nWasn't just the Columbus was slavery like\nHelped make the slave trade\nHappen across the Atlantic like his role in that is fairly hate hate shorted the path ... is at a bare minimum a very pivotal and there's a lot of history there but\nIf that's the point of that is to go ... the the West is worth anything and I think we're missing the point I'm more than happy to say like George Washington\nDid tell lies occasionally you know John Adams was had did have authoritarian tendencies to much Thomas Jefferson did was the strings and full of contradictions e brought about not wanting slavery but he expanded the nation in a way that he knew would have\nAll sorts slavery he would be against John Adams building up the navy but when it gets that navy he goes and uses the numbers off\nIn like the the Barbary pirates so I'm all for like looking back especially in history that's over a century old and going okay this was bad this was good these are complex interesting people doesn't have to be a propaganda fight all the time\nBut Dan Sanchez gets into its we shouldn't get caught up arguing over was Columbus scooter bedroom what should we called Columbus Day or indigenous people's day\nHe actually once why don't we just have a Superman day\nUh you may object or I'd stand Sanchez but Columbus was real and ...\nSnyder the more recent like Superman was in ... the darker kind of Superman that Superman is more realistic dealing with like all sorts of like the trauma of collateral damage it accidently killing innocent people and war ... that's more of a realistic Superman than the iconic super ram\nAll those objections your questions is so\nSo ... heroes you don't need to be real or even realistic to perform their psychological function they don't even need to offer human humanly attainable standards of virtue and excellence they only need to present ideals of
