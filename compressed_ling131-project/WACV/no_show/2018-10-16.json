I Know you\n... it's like a sub basement or somebody telling you you can go underground you just buy them that you're talking about Mr conservative right here in these storms that are ruining the stock market ... scare me even more\nAnd if you ain't a chicken in the storm right now they something wrong when you you wouldn't even big high risk grow high rollers as a friend of mine have you with high roller I'm I'm not going to be high rolling in you know the only thing that goes high and the storm is something to get blown away man that bone ...\nYou know if it goes wrong uh-huh it it's it's not the right song is is bad debt you know this last big storm was Michael uh-huh and I wonder\nWhen it came in when he he oh\nAm I Am I [laughter] I don't know it could as far as I'm concerned they can do a ... loan out of here not among walked out of their seriously though a lot of folks a lot of folks a lot of a lot of damage down and say I think there were a couple of vitality so that's that's the saddest part when I had a\nIt's bad enough when the chickens get their heads all chopped off a hunting but you know\nA [noise] there's all kinds of stone for us to you know a now\nYes I'm a very conservative guy and I believe in conservative politics here but I've got a science background I'm and I'm not trying to get anybody angry at me are mad at me or anything like that but it's obvious to me that the storms are getting stronger is obvious to me the earth is heating up is obvious to me\nThat ah there's things going on do you think it's more global warming or climate change because you know throughout history the climate has changed from time to I mean I mean this area right here was once like you know ice and stuff\nAnd good use yeah if you remember the little ... in the they the problem are what they said calls ...\nWas that the sun itself became a little dimmer our little cold or what are you going to happen some of these things happen that's true for some became a Democrat is that what you're saying for NARAL Pro\n[laughter] a Democrat okay or get it is that the sun has a lot that that that's what's called natural phenomena of yes we don't know what the actual is going on but we have heard I've read in the race it leave that the sun is going\nSet the carbon that say oh two in the air we are rising up all its CEO to and it does cause cause the earth to heat up a\nWe know this it doesn't work for for for industry tapped to here's the problem with it\nIf we get laid down so much that we over spin on trying to protect ourselves and our economy crashed mhm see is a delicate balance and I don't really want to say which way is right or wrong\nButton to say that is not happening are couldn't happen to me as kind of foolish into over span and make it where you can't even do anything is also foolish words has got to be a happy balance\nHonest no you know as soon as he was out of the White House our goer starts this thing and it and the man's got no credentials than ours on a ... and he he's he's making money hand over fist always made a lot of money off and it just it just ... some people will just about believe anything you tell them\nRight and they they sometimes they would be the uh they be the most vocal people's if you know what I'm saying what you\nGot to understand is that in the uh socialistic kind of government yeah is that you know when they do research\nI had a friend of mine he's a scientist to he said look where the money is coming from money's coming from the universities are coming from the government to study climate change course they're going to be pro climate change okay I understand that influence\nBut I also know when you see storms getting stronger ... you can call it natural phenomena are the kind of scares the which outta me if in the year twenty fifty or we say oh we wish we had done something maybe we would I don't know but I probably won't be here to see it but somebody will be\nWell you know they said that uh the the stone that just a here recently Michael yeah that uh they had not had a storm like that in I don't know what forty fifty\nYears because they say the strongest storm that ever hit that area right but it could have just recycling back through and then they ease off I don't know it was a fast hit the storm lemon lemon\nOr if it hadn't been going so fast maybe would have been much more damage there was bad damage but\nUh well from the old song the chickens in the pan out I don't understand what that actually means but\nAh he's he's over there and ah he's he's just kind of he's got some of those French fry tighter shrimp Carl out all always on our porch\nBy the way it's kind of spooky when you come up and Karl's as they are yeah yeah and he's a he likes he likes he likes fried chicken or working alone more when I saw him a minute ago Mm [noise] but uh they're they're all out front we're in here we're we're safe yeah and you know that's something you we all need is a safe place\nAnd and and a lot of times you're not just going to find that you have to get somebody to help you put together a safe place and that's where you need to have your portfolio in a safe place and I'll tell you the guy who can help you with that\nAnd that's David ... Thirty years in the business called him up to seven ... seven for three one he will help you out he will not let the the storms gets you he'll he'll not let the chickens ... stuff he'll he'll take good care of you to seven nine seven four three one big it's a safe\nPlace ... you know these folks and I got one I got several of them you know guns yeah you got to put them in a safe place here I put mine in a safe and lock it up that's my safe place ... ah because you never know when these young chickens well young against youngsters might get a hold of ... you know\nAnd uh so you've got to be careful so any kind of thing that could happen you accidents if you want to call the market drop in an accident you know you will call wrecking your car and acts thing is is probability there's probably be able to say that if you drive a car Seventy five years\nOr longer yeah a year ago and be in an accident that could cause a fatality now my brother was in one of the Nineteen Ninety seven Mm they and they was several fatalities ... luckily everyone in his car\nSurvived ... but the others in the big big big big all huge gigantic vehicle uh they did not who is was his his uh his fault or the other people it was the other people I pulled out in front of him while\nHe was a huge huge truck pulled right out in front of me knocked backs off of it they turned over and burned a while but\nWhat's the chances of that hand you you're driving around in a ... as a small SUV and you'd think that this big truck when you hit it just goes to be smashed you know what happened that vehicle\nWas so does that and for safety when met disaster happened mhm it came apart the way a vehicle that would be safe would come are just like the condo there I have down in Panama City\nThat kinda was built under new specs new laws okay and when the storm came ... there's the that that roof next door the pineapple whether the release calm mhm you know and there's roofs there was another condo complex right next to you is Ruth get heavy damage\nI don't know how much damage we got on the roof but uh you know we're we're still assessing that but he does it seem like it's anywhere near our if any true damage\nSo the thing is if you have a portfolio\nYou're for protection of you will be damaged as much if any\nIf they're storm hits ... that's what you want to do in people say how do you do that how do you put a portfolio into that specific safe zone but that can still make money listen that condo down there is still makes lots of money people random out like crazy they buy into it\nBut when the storm didn't blow away all these other people around here where there are other condos ran their bona way they're going to be hurting their ... their income went down their portfolio went down so you got to be prepared\nFor portfolio erosion are crashing\nEither one portfolios grow mhm but sometimes they run out or do you know you ever seen do rise in the oven OU\nBut eventually quit rising mhm and then if you keep on cooking is going to collapse and in turn into something looks terrible just flat thing yeah overcooked ... so when the portfolio starts getting overcooked you got to take it out of the oven and let it kind of cool down a little bit and put it in a safe place where he won't burn up\nAnd you don't want your portfolio to be gone with the wind no my friend do you want to anchor it down the best you can write and angry with a professional that would be David artist\nSo we were talking about just a few days ago a few weeks ago there are a lot of experts were saying is the stock market's going to get his his top heavy look what it did look what he's doing mhm is it is it going to correct\nWho knows is going to keep going up who knows but do you want to be in a in a vehicle or an airplane or whatever it is that it's got butter and going oh are you rather be down on the ground where you're safe again\nAh let me see [noise] yeah I think down on the ground where you have to be safe you know you get up in that airplane you here's butter and that ain't a good\nFeeling no I don't want to be on some kind of buttering type of vehicle or ... you know in ... your portfolio is a vehicle kind of thing 'cause it gets you where you need to go in your in your retirement\nAnd uh he's just like trying to get some place you want to get there are you getting a good car if it's safe to like my brother's car kept him from losing their life ... you get into a good portfolio we get to retirement keeps you from Lewis\nRetirement I have people coming all the time and I must tell you this guy came in and he gave me permission to the values and his name but I'm going to use his terminology there you go I showed him how we do everything mhm he said you know what\nI get it and said do you do he said\nYour portfolio is sort of like bonds on steroids and I said can I use I coined the phrase and I'm I'm using the yeah bonds you know a ...\nThere's these are insurance products that utilize bonds corporate bonds and the interest that they kick out they buy options with strategies and things like that and so these things are guaranteed the principles guaranteed a everything is guaranteed in the interest that goes back in is guaranteed\nIn anything that you make that goes into it is guaranteed to never go away mhm so since the insurance companies using bonds to drive that and options to drive it\nYeah I think about it is bonds on steroids ... bonds normally don't make a lot of money they just make whatever right their bike ride but if you give if you give a a a racehorse a bunch of steroids\nFro for about a year that's a horse can run pretty fast and then he probably going to drop dead yeah keep feeding him steroids yeah that won't be good\nReid said he would get a new ... uh we get an a so called New Hampshire you trade in your own horse for a new that's what the insurance companies that do they get a new and they keep you of fresh brand new horse you ever heard it only westerns that come flying\nIn and they gave me a phrase shoulders Pony Express you know yeah sure yeah we these insurance companies give you a ...\nA fresh auction every year on your what they call strategies\nAnd so what happens is\nYou're always fresh you're always running strong and they find in this thing with bond so you're a gap bonds on steroids every year you get a fresh horse and it gets on steroids and we just keep on going I asked for a fresh shores and they gave me one he says Hi sailor\n[laughter] in a\nMan you got the wrong ... weird horse that was the wrong west or do\nYou yeah [laughter] I Can't imagine [laughter] ah yeah that's weird true grit and you know [laughter] I'm just\nGoing through all these things I could say that would get a second off is out there that are on trying not I'm not saying we need to stay on our ours is yes we should yes\nSo that's it you will to stay on your horse or you don't want to get bumped off\nA ... I used to ride horses when I was a kid and a lot and uh I got bucked off quite a bit but I learned some tricks about staying on horse you gotta learn some tricks about staying in your ... your portfolio staying owned horse in other words you can put your ... your portfolio on a bucking horse\nIs a good chance you can get bumped off yeah which is you put your portfolio on a horse that just Gallup strong and tries to keep you on the back and if something goes wrong that horse evens out that ride for you and then when you get to the end of that year or two you get a fresh or she keep running again with it\nThen your portfolio just keeps on going you look over to the side and maybe somebody else had that bucking horse in the portfolio is scattered all over the ground he's laying over there all broke up and everything and and he broke his crown there's just not a good thing when you get yeah off the horse\nSo that's it the the storms of life um [noise]\nNo I'm not all negative I'm all about using the market with these ... these programs used the markets my friend the thing is we use the markets in a smart way we use the markets where we can't lose today tomorrow no way we can't lose money in\nThe principal's guaranteed by insurance companies people say well I don't look insurance companies will you know what nobody really lives the insurance companies but I have ways\nThen I was not only the denial oh it was a very rooms in Iowa so we will stretch it all out we'll get to the bottom of it\nSo much for him not being in the north\nKoreans are all very well relationships are very good I think a lot of good things will happen in the head and you know we've done it for months there's nobody in the years\nBut I think North Korea coming along very well be ... that I\nLove standing out there holding his umbrella and walk into the walking to the\nHelicopter good for him for a second I thought he was had a ... a good good she's\nSmiling yes ... is smiling oh hold on his ... hold on to hear the great\nJob and ... and the other night\nBut I Do do better than what you did a great job of dollars if I ever could\nAll right you're listening to the Laura Ingraham show eight five five forty Laura ... we're joined now by Pat Buchanan I ... I Would never put Pat Buchanan offer anyone except the president and I know he understands that have\nBeen put off by presidents before [laughter]\nAll right in the interview I guess he's been talking to a king or Saudi Arabia\nYeah I mean we have to get into this show again a situation I I again he walks into a a a its consulate in Turkey and he doesn't come out okay so looks like something happen got chopped up or something I\nWe we don't know what happened but of course he he ... he wrote a column in Saudi on Arab newspaper that was canceled\nYou know the guys you know marriage was collapsing at one point and now he now he's he's an Islamic even though the New York times today said look the guys in Islam asked but also has been a path royal service now doesn't mean it should be obviously should be killed but there are people out there seem to want us to go to war\nOver a person you know like the person being killed or snuffed out in someone else's conflict I mean how is\nHow does that make any sense path\nWhere really this is a classic case of course ... interests are crucial I mean for everything we know for sure he went in there they brought in our friends or to experts from Saudi Arabia where the bone saw\nHe didn't come out in your head Fifteen guys going on to point injured come out the same guy yeah and the trouble a lot of tapes in videos claiming we've got some information\nTo Saudi Arabia for some but not for some purpose so but the key thing here today is you've got the prince of Saudi Arabia's crown prince and the king put the credibility of Saudi Arabia on the line that they did not do this and so you've got to America's checking it out\nAnd the same time as this looks like a real atrocity in a moral atrocity at the same time they're very serious state interests in us relations with Saudi Arabia so you've got to balance those things out\nYou know I remember you know Richard Nixon there were over there and try to toast and Mao tse dong at the same time they're going through the massacres of the great for a little tour and cultural revolution because we needed to deal with the Chinese against the Russians in the Cold War it's a real conflict here between morality and state interest\nAnd it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out\nBut it's undeniable that Donald Trump believes he is acting in the best interest cold national interests of the United states\nMarco Rubio a someone who\nNow it's much more of a neoconservative ... Russia\nAh on occasion with other Republican vilify Mitt just acts like Russia's been sometimes be a bigger threat than it is even though he's been fantastic actually lately on China Ruben has been great this is when he sent about Saudi Arabia yesterday\nWe've already asked for a magnet the investigation which means individuals responsible for that decision would be sanctioned beyond now there are other options that we can take I said that's something that needs to be thought through carefully but it needs to be very strong and meaningful can be symbolic it can't just be worth\n... that\nI Do agree with mark ... excuse me Senator Rubio to this extent [noise] uh you can't just brush this well if if the investigation points to the crown prince and the crown prince\nI don't know how you make the future leader of Saudi Arabia persona non grata and impose sanctions on him personally say he can't come to the United states and seizes bank accounts or something like that so you got a real conundrum here so I think what's going to happen\nIs eating at the Saudis are now working with the Turks and the Turks a lot of countries over there in the middle east to have a real vested interest in not having a breach between Saudi Arabia and the United states so gentle are you're going to see these\nInterests of ours against the sort of a moral decision you gotta take which is this is an outrage it can't be allowed to happen and it's got to be punished by sanctions at least against the individual someone suggested that to the solution is going to be the inevitable road agents went and did something they weren't supposed to do\nNow and they wanted to give the crown prince viability right\nI mean this is ... and ... ... exactly and over again you know when I was running against her considering running against George W. Bush remembers the Tiananmen Massacre\nAnd can't um and square was just a couple of months later that Scowcroft Eagleburger over their toes to them\nSo you know you had the state interest in the relations with China at the same time you could not condone\nWhat they had done to a democratic uprising and ... square I mean we've gone down through history one after another after another is and again it's a conflict between the state and between ... and the state and morality\nWell and just another fact then we'll move on pat ... we talked about this are touched on this last week was an acquaintance bin Laden's I'm going back decades and that was the problem is there\nA big family in Saudi Arabia yeah\nSo that somebody you know claim to fame and he on Twitter and other as well yeah exactly and after his uh\nIn the ... game basically mourn his death while saying I'm basically using his nickname on Twitter and Sam and I'm I collapsed crying awhile ago\nHeartbroken for you ... which was a nickname for bin Laden and he said you were beautiful and brave in those days and Afghanistan before you surrendered to hatred and passion it's I mean somewhat\nDiminished the grief over ... death to promote all that stuff gets out and that'll be another part of this whole the whole thing I Would say is the is a study demonization of ... that may be may be painting a realistic picture of what the Saudis are dealing with\nThat doesn't justify murder but does mitigate hostility of the Saudi crown prince of Saudi regime ... out here is going to divide us Arctic right you take the journalist immediately pulled out of this conference this week whereas\nTrump is left so far out of the treasury secretary my nutrition has gone to the conference [noise]\nYeah that's a future investment initiative hum of\nOcean the desert right [laughter] what that fond of the original Davos\nAre are kind of people Pat Pat bloated that we're going to take a break and then bring it back over after the commercial break so we can have a little bit more time with you about the president rudely took I took up some of our time with Pat Buchanan will take a break it out very quickly here be right back hold it there the Laura Ingraham show\n\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity dead management is\nMy story begins with that a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're inducted and you need help cold trinity at one eight hundred seven nine for ... for three seven\nWhen I first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I looked at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical debt\nThat was in my life would go way could he will consolidate your accounts to do one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands would I Would tell other people please pick up the phone and call trinity just let them put together a program\nAnd see how affordable and easy it is to pay off your debt\nCold trinity a one eight hundred seven nine for ... for three something that's one eight hundred seven nine for oh four three seven [noise]\nOne of those countries in the world wars boss but one of those jobs don't you just do jobs like looking for anyone with a both will just call him a\nGold current corporate ...

thousand twenty fourth Native American they just put that correction on the Boston Globe store\n[noise] yeah I mean I'll tell you one thing she is a hundred percent not qualified\nUh and it's

and they were glad my wife and I on a on a clear path to a much better situation not that we were in a really rough spot but it feels a lot better be where we are now I'm In um [noise] we are a very quickly approaching the end of baby step three in January will be\nSix months plus and so my uh my focus now is four or five and six and reading your book and go into the class was actually more than once and um\nWhen I'm really faced with is our house we moved in and two thousand six and a we pay two fifty to a according to the low and you know casual conversation we're not we're not at the two fifty two so after you know twelve plus years were not back to our original soap or you know purchase price [noise]\nUm that's weird\nYeah it no you know Phoenix got hit really hard by the thousand bowl and we ... really hard\nI'm Sorry a lot of people even across the street or are you know to double the price of the house they bought a couple of years after we [noise] we bought on the right side on the downside of the top but we're still not back there even you know I guess maybe it's our neighborhood worse than others\nThe approach four or five and six steps for five and six I'm you know I have two teenage sons were going to be faced with college here soon I'm very excited to get back into our retirement planning which we put on hold back at the beginning and so now I'm just trying to figure out if we just\nForget the house and not put anything\nWhen they're lying down or in order of priority for five six but done simultaneously so the way that might sound would be you start with Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement that's by reason of war period unless you're in an emergency situation you do that now\nI'm ... and then you move on to kids college you've got college looking down you're looking down the barrel gun on college and so that's probably going to take everything above and beyond your Fifteen Percent going into retirement and your rights house would probably on hold for a little while when you got two teenagers and no college funds you got some catching up today right\nIs or you know so you're going to probably that's ... five is probably going to suck up all your extra money right now because of the situation you're in the age of the kids\nUm before you get to six so you're just gonna keep paying your house payment for now and get these kids through school and as quick as you get school quote unquote taken care of\nAnd my question is I'm just immigrated to the United states and I've lived a frugal life um like say my money ... ... ... but since I've arrived in the United states um about a ... some of my clients was telling me I'm that you'll frugal living will make your social loud cost ya if you don't buy into the wars and expensive cars and all the states\nUs and I'm trying to understand what would be your take on that\n[laughter] oh I Love it or\nDid your emigrated from a United Kingdom United Kingdom okay and where did you grow up um I was born in India I immigrated to the u._k. when I was Seventeen okay and you're how old a twenty nine okay and how long does you're living in ... eleven years were you a social outcasts there um no [laughter]\nWell ah where did you live in the u._k. a for the call off right pretty good size city it is it's it's a nice it's a very legitimate so they can and you weren't a social outcasts there for being frugal\nNow but um I was like what do you live in the United states um I live in San Diego\nThere to [laughter]\nYou might be as ... as they are now I'm getting a gay their people and certainly in\nSan Diego that have common sense as well so um I don't know what crowd you're running with there but um it's different than the one you ran with an India or the one you ran with an baths for sure [noise] um because they have been bitten by the bug of consumerism but plenty of Americans um\nIn any city um will or not consider us social outcasts for having good common sense values now\nOr that's assuming you're you know you if your clothes are not necessarily expensive but they are at least clean mhm and your watch um I'm I'm I'm more good well over\nTen million dollars is buildings worth ... million that you're standing in is paid for and that's my watch pretty on assuming I'm like it costs about a hundred and fifty bucks\nA problem is I don't care what you think and if you think I feel like I'm cool because I have a watch I don't really think you're cool so um you know that's the thing you got to decide who you want to influence you\nUm and where you want to end up so what brought you to the United states why did you come here\nIt was um a childhood dream that I had mhm um I read somewhere that um\nBecause this country guarantees freedoms to all people to Supreme Court ruled that no one can be false to a re signed the pledge of allegiance and that just got hold of me I was about twelve years old and I tried to apply that in my school in India or get a naive I was um didn't realize the American constitution doesn't apply in India\nAnd uh and I got 'em ... me out and got in trouble yeah I did I listen to the principal and the fact that the principal one day when I make it to the United states you wouldn't be able to do that to me anymore\nSo freedom that is correct freedom okay and now people are trying to take your freedom from you with a forcing you to conform\nTo something using a social pressure but not all okay and so I Would treat it exactly the same way as hard as you have fought\nThrough you know twenty nine years of your life to get to be standing here um I wouldn't surrender my freedom that have tried to stuff\nNot all in the name of someone being impressed generally speaking a here's a good rule of thumb people who are impressed by things that you have or aware are not impressive people\nWhen you get inside of their hearts and inside of their minds are what we would call shallow and so um the very people you might attract by having some bling by having some jewelry or some watches or the proper\nClothing are the people that you really don't want influencing your future and your character in your life you've paid a huge price to get to be here and enjoy the freedom and so you're a man of character\nUm the uh ... and the the\nThey want 'em to be influencing me I might want to influence them and try to help them but if I were in your shoes I Would say that doesn't need to be your inner circle that are teaching you how to live mentor and you decide billing you and so forth um and so\nYou know check out a folks that have a little more depth of character and aren't judging you based on what you drive now again it needs to be if you drive an old car um that's a while you're trying to achieve a financial go or something one of these big lane\nAnd maintained you don't take good care of it but um it doesn't it doesn't need to be dirty and doesn't need to be missing the same thing with your clothing or your hair or whatever else you take care of the things that you have and and managed them but most wealthy people or do not by\nA expensive things to impress other people\nAre a few do but most don't that's how they became wealthy now they do by some expensive things that I buy some expensive things but there for me\nAnd for my family and for my wife and that kind of thing and they're not for what someone thinks I'm I'm I've got a really nice home but I didn't buy it for somebody else a we live there you know and what you think about are good or bad doesn't really matter to me and so I\nI don't know is that helpful is that a hopeful part of this year is that what you were looking answer I think I needed to hear that that'll come what are you doing for a living and I look an ID in IT of and what do you do a developer you're developing okay All right well you probably need to come to Nashville work rush [laughter]\nSaudis in order to meet you sir it's quite a story brother quite a story Well Don thanks for stopping by and just open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five ... this is the Dave Ramsey show D is with us in Atlanta Hi Dee how are you\nI Am well thank you for asking sure what's up [noise]\nUm I wanted to ask if I should say my tax from here and she reported off information um on our Seventeen taxes and as a result we're being charged that ten thousand dollars\nYou're being charge ten thousand dollars in penalties\nYeah uh-huh not taxes\nI Want to pay their taxes and penalties yeah okay I mean it sounds like a percentage on the information mhm and well that the ...\nFalse information she lied intentionally and you\nGet who've that yeah why would you do as\nI guess it it back more money I don't know like Frank fishy claim that we have a business that we don't own she claimed that we're paying a car that we don't own she point claimed that we're paying 'em from mileage for their business again and we don't own\nThat's weird but then when does your husband have something to do with this when he doesn't have heat that we could see where no I mean they just randomly\nOut of thin air she'd dreamed up a business that you don't have an cars you don't have\nA knowledge that you don't have\nRight now we have a charge which you know churches down okay talk so there was no there is nothing in the um the documentation that mentioned anything about that charge you know they use are a number of either five but when the number of jazz there's random\nAre you are you doing a work outside the five oh one ... see three as a venture lists that you're being paid uh outside of the church\nNo\nYou're not you know they're speaking engagements and get paid for that on the side\nNow everything's through the church or a hundred percent\nAnd you know for the charge me don't make any money for the church has his own anti we both work independently room\n... okay yeah okay um well I\nI think if there are I I don't know you need to see an attorney is the answer the question 'cause I don't know whether you have grounds to sue someone or not this is a very bizarre thing as someone would do this just out of the blue eye is not a mirror mistake I mean it's a complete fabrication\nAnd so um I mean this is off it sounds like fraudulent activity on your behalf now you sign the tax returns though didn't you\nKnow and I think they don't you know but you had to see the tax returns\nYou you you didn't allow someone to send in tax returns are due to the ... and I said you may have trouble I don't know you need to see an attorney and asked them\nHow much gas is the most you can help to get back will be the penalties and the taxes you already oh and you still owe the penalties are do them not being paid on time due to this um and I think that's the most you might get\nSome attorney and\n\nDid you know that if you combined the data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American has had their personal info compromised or act\nOver fifty percent of our listeners and viewers tell us that they or someone in their family has been a victim and Seventy percent of those folks have had\nIt happen more than once to this is unbelievable once you get your info the risk never goes away and they can use it whenever and however they choose it truly has become an issue of\nNot if but when that is why they only plan I've ever recommended histories and her insurance I actually sat down with them and we put together a plan that I felt provided the best protection but

wondering what they would do would you put the fifty grand down on a new home or\nThe one thousand dollar car loan and ... so\nI Would sell the car [laughter] it's older car okay [laughter] I thought that's what you might say I'm okay what's your hustle into a one hundred and bought a hundred and sixty five thousand\nRight so let me let me let me kind of walk into the equation of how went there so clearly okay let's say that we pay off the car with this money and then we just twenty thousand dollars to put down on our house\nAnd if you had the exact same house you're talking about buying earlier I'm a centrally you have financed your car\nOn your home mortgage would you agree with that\nYou are correct\nAnd um that would take a dump car purchase and make it even worse okay\nThat's where that's how I got there so quickly because okay basically we're financing a Cornell over Fifteen Years\nWhich I'm not going to ever obviously what ... what are refinance my house in order to buy a thirty thousand dollar car\nNot a million years [laughter] you know and it's basically the same equation were just saying it in different ways as we continue in our conversation here and sometimes if you just look at it through a different different stand over on the other side of it and look at it from the left rather than from the right you see oh my God that really is done you know and so it's not as\nIt's not as a you know it's not just Dave says sell the car it's do you really want to finance this car over Fifteen Years\n[noise] you know what I Want to do that so and as a car I Can't

thousand to good old Sallie Mae that wow\nHow long have you guys been married three years three years and so shortly after marriage the two of you look at this pile of debt and something happened tell me what about your story\nBut we were just kind of doing a normal thing um we were actually started out on the the ten year for given this program and I actually heard you come across the radio um\nI was driving around in my work truck and uh just was always interested in finances but really never knew\nUm where to start or where to begin and we picked up on your program and within a few weeks I purchased a total moneymaker over read the book I talk or and I said we got to get on this I said we're doing it all wrong and we started it out and uh she just kind of followed my lead on it a while which was allowed out yeah yeah\nIt was it was I mean she's a follower and she\nWas really I have some leadership [laughter]\n\nShe is in our words he didn't read the book really at all um and then eventually after\nI don't know about a year into the program she was starting to get mad at me because of the program and everything I said we just need to um instead of yelling at me we need to go to the financial peace and then you can hear from the source right from days and then you\nCan ... it takes on my back and\nYou know with the video guy yeah very cool okay so you got in there then and you saw it for yourself rather than just go on oh the engineer knows the numbers because I kind of how it started right yeah the engineer guy he's going to do the numbers I'm the\nMedical personnel let him do the numbers and then you get in there and you see for yourself so what happened when you went to the glass coordinator gave you a emotional ownership really in this thing\nHere I think it made it very tangible for me something that I could see in that the leaders of our class they were very open about their debt and how they had beat it and that was something motivating for me\nFor me it felt like it was this constant uphill battle and I had this crazy burden because it was all mine yeah it's a little bit of a guilt trip yeah ... and so that class honestly made me feel a little more supported and just give us the opportunity to\nTruly jumping and know that actually getting out of debt was realistic\nWhen you first start Jim how did you do it's a ... a lot of debt and twenty I ... it was a long\nYeah it was hard we started the\nThe very beginning of January in two thousand and sixteen now and uh it was it it it was hard made\nTwo years and four months running and yeah and that's that is a long long time but it's a hundred and forty three thousand dollars and you killed at all if yeah how old are you too I'm ... and you're not even Thirty years old so some of these

Thirty years old you know what I mean payments in the world in life is pretty good yeah that's awesome so who are your biggest cheerleaders I think it was kind of each other and the very beginning we we didn't talk about it a whole lot um\nAnd we kind of had some friends and families that were saying like what what are you doing\nI think after we got rolling through the process and we were getting some traction paying off quite a bit of money are quite a bit of dead people started to come around then when you look at somebody go Barney put all of a hundred thousand dollars or shut them up you know absolutely yeah\nYeah it's like you don't have to shut up it just says it is good yeah that's great very cool you guys very very well done which the key to getting out of debt\nFor us I think it was doing it together first of all the also being willing to work very hard I work three jobs and worked overtime and also never really strengthen the path I feel like once we decided to jump into the plan\nWe did not strength from that and honestly whenever I Would buy something like if I spent too much on groceries I Would feel bad\nBecause that was money that would be knocking out my land out\nThere I gave you gave your boundaries process yeah what about you oh I think the the the [noise]\n\nIt it was it was it was good I mean we we were it was a key for him for you what was the main thing that got you out of debt you know work extra Everest or if you raise your income over fifty thousand dollars Courtney finished residency program that is huge for her\nShe got a big raising them you know I Would I Would say call 'em and and the dispatch at the utility company and just uh the extra income any chance you could get extra overtime home do it you know it it really helps the

income or capital gains also aren't capital gains tax much lower than earned income\nUh that is not considered earn income it is considered investment income\nAnd it depends on what the money's invested in as to whether there'll be capital tax capital gains rate or taxed on an ordinary income right\nIf the investment is paying off on something that is less than a year old it will be at ordinary income if it's coming out of a traditional i._r._a. or it's never yet been taxed it'll be on an ordinary income if it's coming out of a four O. one K. traditional not raw\nIt will be taxed at ordinary income as it comes out\nAll of the money will be a hundred percent not just the returns because none of it the growth has never been ... or the money you put in has never been to act on a traditional so you'll pay ordinary income on those if you have investments simply invested in the piece of real estate you don't pay any taxes\nUntil your salad and then you pay taxes on capital gains

couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys\nGeorge it was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know Mike Nesmith who was one of the members of the monkeys I said no\nIt's a digital Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no and he said did you know he was a Christian Scientists which is a a a a healing and and mentally based um a form of spirituality I said no he said well we'd like you to\nIn a a review Nesmith a memoir for the Washington Post that you interested and I said of course I'm interested and I told him this story of how months before without any for thought about any of this I started getting into the monkeys\nAnd I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post to its credit included this material that was just the weirdest thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way whereas if I was loose from linear time this is why I'm saying that time\nFor that opportunity because for reasons that no one could understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason seem to be off in the future so to speak but my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once which is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkey started plane was there a long long time ago and if I remember one of the members was Mickey ... that's right who played circus boy on television right that's\nRight and and still touring still touring\n... yeah there's still going that's giant at absolutely that's I Love them [laughter] and do you know the name Joe ... gallon burger by any chance I don't ... I wrote a couple of books one called liquid luck oh of course her I I Know the book I Know K he he would conduct experiments still does in Las Vegas\nWith groups of people ... ... ... ... trying to prove that positive thinking and the mind has a lot to do with influencing things that happen that's Ryan and he is totally convinced that he's convinced me too\nThat if you go into a situation like Las Vegas upbeat and you know just you know positive about things the odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is that outlook is been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. rind pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties JPEG is now deceased\nAnd one of the things that Jay be found that he just bury this in the foot notable book but it's monumental\nThat when his subject in the ESP lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were positive their scores bike when they were bored when they were down cast\nWhen they were fatigue their scores death and it was inevitable ... bike followed mood it's the same thing that he says and the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't happen to be Las Vegas down in ... you know putting a black cloud over your head for whatever reason you know he's not going to happen for you\nIt's not going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is\nAnd again this one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it you must really wanted you must really want it if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning in Vegas or the lottery or money or whatever\nIt's not going to work it has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to truly identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power there\nBecause the power comes from an emotionally charged thought\nWe're talking with Mitch Horwitz his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we are going to tell you how you can get a membership in the miracle of a little bit later on in the program his website is his name all linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com it's amazing how well how did you\nDecide to write this kind of a book\nYou know it was funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize\nEvery chapter that I wrote every person who I talked about in the book I was using their methods I was road testing these things myself\nAnd I thought to myself look if I'm experimenting with these methods myself and if that's what's driving my historical research why am I right about the methods why did I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques and it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves\nAs believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share with\nReaders the actual hands on things I Do in my own life how powerful is\nRation is only coming to understand look\nWe are realizing that things work out there like placebo surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George\nAnd lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated in clinical experiments today\nI think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't mean that we don't live under many laws and forces but if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs that the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments that the thoughts change the brain\nYour sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter sort of thought\nThe brain and fall has to be something that's extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nBut we're human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't ... if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel project one of the things that I read about in the book\nIs that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws and forces belong mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind is the same way circumstances are\nGoing to intrude upon how we experience of these things so we're ordinance\nThat we experiment very clearly and very carefully\nMisery are going to come back and talk more about your work the miracle club next hour and we'll take phone calls questions and miracle stories\nDo forget to watch a TV show beyond belief

about his latest book which is called the miracle club ... thoughts become reality will take your calls and your stories\nNext hour as well how does he is pie fit into this mess you were talking about it briefly but ah I I tend to think there's a very deep rooted tie in here\nYou know there is without question you know ... we've experienced in this country about eighty years of serious\nPsychological research serious experiments and the ESP creek technician telepathy and George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing in the S P lab is that the mind possesses extra physical qualities there are ways\nThat we receive and get and give information that go beyond that five senses once we've come to grips with the fact that the mind is extra physical but the mind has an existence\nOutside the same fate body and open the door to all kinds of possibilities we realize we are not just material beings and it helps confirmed to us that\nOur thoughts make a difference in the world we may be like sending and receiving stations we're always looking for people to help us with projects to give us a hand to meet us\nHalfway and as I was mentioning in the last segment J. B. right and the grade ESP researcher found that\nESP result spike in the laboratory based on the enthusiasm of the subject so that gives you a different perspective on how important your thoughts are what actually happens to you may be based on your emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nAnd you believe that you can just change your entire life this way get a better job maybe find the relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff\nI Do believe that but here's the key thing and this is really the magic key if there is one behind all of our\nSelf help systems you must wanted with everything and you you must want it with passionate intensity and we often tell ourselves that we want things without scrutinizing\nAnd examining our convictions do we really wanted for example we say we want a job when what we really want is security we say we want a new relationship when what we really want\nMaybe is is is something else you know to move\nTo somehow rearrange the furniture of our lives it's very important that we get down to the essentials of what we really want before we put a label on it because I Would contend that what\nYou want over time you're going to get do people know what they want\nThat is really the key thing we tell ourselves well we want you know we say gee I Want a better job I Want romance I Want to live you know in this city versus that city but my\nUrging people might urging to people and this was something ... can do right now is to sit down with a pencil and paper and for a mature stained sustained period of time really write down your deepest desires your deepest once\nThink about this dwell on this be private about this don't talk to anybody about it being intimate\nAnd see if they channel in one direction discover what you want star because sometimes we repeat things to ourselves by rote and they don't represent are really passionate heartfelt desires get in touch with your desires you may think you have but I Would contend that few of us actually have\nMitch how close you echoed the secret that story or a different\nI ... it's different in some ways I have a lot of respect for run to burn and the secret but I rarely use the term lava traction because\nI don't believe we live under one mental super law I Believe that given the circumstances we live under we experienced many different laws and forces like the law of gravity as I was saying in the previous\nSegment and so I think it's a mistake to think that our minds and our thoughts are the only game in town so to speak they are part of the game they are part of the game and that's important enough that's essential enough\nYou write about how people travel back into time to help other current life yeah but can't that also be dangerous\nYes it can and it's a very interesting prospect this is why I tell people be careful of what you're thinking about be careful of what you're doing because you know we like to play games with ourselves and we'd like to say gee you know if I could travel back into time and give advice to my Fifteen year old self what would I say well my contention is\nYou may be doing that all the time that may be happening all the time linear time is very likely a very powerful illusion that we use to organize our lives but what we've discovered\nIn hard sciences as well as over the course of testimony from centuries is that\nLife is intimate everything is happening now there is in ... the two of events occurring at once and we select among them so it could be that we are selecting among events past president future all the time and yet these things feel very real to a story set in concrete to us\nBut I Would contend that when you think about going back and giving advice to a younger self you may actually be doing that so be careful be careful we are granted perspective we are granted some perspective but use your mind use your thoughts carefully because things that you may think of as a novelty may actually be concretely we'll\nPut it all into Apple's stock that's where they come back well [laughter]\nWell who knows George you know who knows the guy who owns Apple's stock right now you know he may have just had that fought based on what you said and he's experiencing that his concrete reality whereas there might have been another reality operative and his wife a few minutes ago\nMitch what is the third day mental challenge\nThirty day mental challenge is something that I invite everybody to join van it's very very simple\nAnd any coastal is there who emails me I Will send them a little instruction sheet you basically right out a pledge that for the next thirty days you were going to dedicate your mind to everything that as productive progressive forwarding you're not going to think of negative events\nPossibilities of the future you're going to think that every reasonable ambition is within your grass\nIt make up a grid of thirty days you do this for thirty days it's your private experiment just see what happens see what happens it sounds easy but it's not it's very difficult\nAnd if you fall off the horse you don't have to restart the thirty days you just get back on the horse the ideas to just try to direct your mind in the direction of that which is positive and productive for thirty days\nSee what happens when you give thirty days of the possibility of experiencing a whole different life and I will do it with you I Will do it with you and if you're having a hard time you can write to me you can email me and say you know I really fell off the wagon last night and uh I'm there in the trenches with you\nA couple of years ago I started the coast prayer club and you know what that is Mitch has on Fridays\nPeople will neutralize a list of people who have written in is who are on the prayer list for whatever they need a willing or it's a new job in a selection\nSomething people even right in and said please pray for my cats you know you sick and stuff like that anyway how powerful do you believe and and I will say I believe this works cause I've gotten emails back\nAfter the fact and people say you know so and so's thing was cured and this like that but how powerful de believe prayer is\nI really do believe prayers powerful and it's for this reason I don't think Mother Nature plays cruel tricks on us there are instances and there are times in life where somebody is feeling so depressed and facing such difficulty that they can't do the things that I'm prescribing they can't\nDirect their minds in a positive way they are all kinds of methods and techniques I can give them but let's face it there are times in line for we feel crushed by circumstance ... that's when ... comes in\nThat's when ... comes in prayer is an escape hatch from the difficulties of our own psyche from the difficulties of life circumstances when we can do nothing else\nWe can pray and there's no wrong or right right way to pray it's an escape hatch\nFrom our own psyche so again I don't think we've been putting too cosmic framework\nThe tricks us I think we've been given away out when we can't use our minds and the way I'm describing and there are times where people are suffering from addiction from depression from Greek and they can't do the things I'm saying there were times I Can't do the things I'm saying that's where ... comes in and I devote a special section to prayer in the mirror clubs\nIs no one as powerful as many when you are dealing with miracles\nThat's a fascinating question and a lot of people have said that if you get a group of people doing something it can amp up the energy and I believe that's true I absolutely believe that's true I Believe if you get ten people meditating in a room\nAnd it's a place where everybody knows

I'm Sorry ... they can size\n... well I actually had an ... time around when the issue at ... event I went up and share came North Carolina and and there was a chief time that I actually knew when I was a little girl please go up there every every year for vacation my family\nAnd that cheap son had just lost his father a cheap crazy hair had just passed away what\nShe's crazy here I Am I going to store I've got to interrupt your story ... ... when when I ... my wife and I went out to the ... the whole nation for a little while uh\nIn Arizona and there was a guy there um gosh what was that I Can't remember his name but anyway he lived out there on the on the reservation and I mean we were like\nTwo hours from civilization I mean it was the middle of nowhere and we got there at night and I actually got a little spooked because I had never seen a sky with that many stars and then it all wow it's kind of disorienting when you're that way for many lights\nAnd I mean we are on the middle of never who we were if anyone familiar with opinion Arizona a kind of in the middle of nowhere so anyway I I'm up there um\nAnd we meet a guy ... was his name bill ... was his name he lived down on the on the reservation I'm and we're sitting in there or were next to where he lived and I wake up in the morning my hair's nuts I mean it's all crazy well the the Navajo word for white man was Billy Guyana and so he called me Billy gone\nCrazy here [laughter]\nBarely got crazy\nBecause every morning when I woke up and it happened the whole time I was there like every morning when I wake up my hair would be nuts exhibiting on a cruise\nYou here [laughter] [laughter] oh my God that anyway so when you said there's a cheap crazy here I feel like a distant Ken\nI understand [laughter] well anyway um I was I talking to him and I wished I could remember his name actor and he was relating to me that\nStay in power or the Cherokee or concern hate believe if his opinion data Cherokee could not be considered a chair and I knew at Cherokee language so that really really\nI'm Crying at home and on their heritage\nAnd I I read a great article over the weekend ... great call by the way a great call 'cause it it it it allows us to jump off on a very poignant story hey thank you for your call I read I read an article over the weekend\nAnd this was in advance of Elizabeth Warren's test results coming out yesterday I don't know does she did she release him over the weekend around thinking was yesterday okay I read an article on why do so many white people claimed to have Cherokee heritage is a great article out to try to find them posted on Facebook because it's it's it's incredibly telling have you ever noticed that\nThey ... if you ask your average wipers now claimed to have a lot of them claim that Cherokee heritage they don't claim you know Choctaw heritage they don't claim seminal heritage they don't claim sue heritage they don't claim you know a crow heritage or or or\nUtah Jon haired they claimed Cherokee heritage\nAnd and and there's this there's this miss those that has arisen around people with Cherokee blood as a result of so many people claiming over the\nYears Cherokee\nHeritage\nIt turns out there's a reason so many people claimed Cherokee heritage\nAs the settlers were moving south and west the Cherokee Nation was one of the first nations I sort of bumped into\nAnd they weren't particularly hostile obviously you know all the native tribes were little hostile but they weren't the most hostile they came into a you won't find a lot of people for example claiming I'm\nCommand she heritage right the ... [laughter] a little more violent most Savage people that ever lived a you won't see a lot of people claiming that whole heritage because the ... didn't put much put up with the white man in order to come and she's a there's a great story called empire of the\nSummer ... moon I think it was called anyway the the life story of quantum Parker Q. U. A. N. A. H. Parker quantum Parker look up that book empire I think it's empire the summer moon or in part of the summer sun something like that but it's quantum Parker he was the last great\n... a command she warrior the last great command chief\nOr before they finally broke the command cheese and brought 'em in and everything and and quantum Parker was actually such a great and well respected chief even when they went on the new reservations Teddy Roosevelt actually went out to Nebraska to meet with ... in his home\nIs the first I mean unbelievable sign of respect quantum Parker traveled to Washington DC and met with dignitaries there and and everything else ah it's a great great story it's a really cool story but the ... if you read the story\nYou will and it's a very fast reader reads like a work of fiction but the fact is just extremely detailed are in short quantum Parker was half white\nHis mother was kidnapped out of an early Texas settlement by the command she's taken up to Nebraska where she was raised from a young girl as a command she she birth corner Parker her name was I think it's a\nCash Sarah Parker Elizabeth part or something like that but she burst corner who became known as quantum Parker and are actually later in life they they recaptured his mother the the white folks founder and recaptured her and she wouldn't leave the command she's to come back to civilization\nShe's like I'm not leaving my son I'm not leave 'cause she was treated pretty well I mean after being beaten and raped and everything else she was she was ... she was treated pretty well and didn't want to\nAnd she'd taken up the command she language and forgotten English there was a it's a really fascinating story everybody ought to read it if you have any interest whatsoever in Indian stories um\nI Wish I knew the exact name of it but but I think it's in part of the summer months or in part of the summers on something like that on a park or if you look that up you find it up but anyway as the white folks were president west the Cherokees actually I think saw what was happening\nAnd said okay well we'll do is we'll accept some of them into our group and we'll put some of our girls into their group and that way it'll be like a peace offering and they won't be so ... means with us and and kill us and shooters and everything else [noise] uh and maybe we can we can all get along well that didn't work out but\nUh in short there were a lot of people at the time\nWho sort of took Cherokee women into their groups\nAnd and it and it over time it became almost romanticized and it became almost romanticized where you know\nPeople a couple of generations later their stories started mixing you know this wasn't a time when we had television and photographs and then all of this stuff in in genealogy was a little suspect and you might not\nYou know people died young you might not remember who your great grandmother was\nAnd so people would say oh no no no my great grandmother she was a Cherokee princess it was all it was almost always a Cherokee princess she was a chair they didn't even have princes by what she was a Cherokee princess\nAnd that's why that's why we moved around and that's why we were kind of not accepted by these groups and that's why we were poor that's why we're the because we had Cherokee blood and it became almost like a a sign of honor ... so much so\nThat if you it's kind of like Woodstock if you took all the people who claimed they were what stuck to be like twenty five million people Woodstock if you claim to all the people who claimed that they had a Cherokee princess or some sort of Cherokee blood and it's almost always a woman\n... it would be astronomical number of people would be actually Cherokees [laughter] you know there would be almost no white people in this country I think that's probably what happened to Elizabeth Warren she probably did genuinely believe she had Cherokee blood now I think she probably exploited that for the sake of\nYou know what it's like to battle over three hours mainly multi how life is ... when when [laughter]\nThen you've got to go make small talk with someone you barely know it's tough I like it when people come up and say hello I Love when people come up and say hello I just don't want to engage and just if I get back to my rigatoni bowl a day is going to be offended you know that's it ah our number two seven to nine to twenty minutes till ten o'clock rebels\nI grow quicker than we are we going to fix the second rule\nAnd no you know what I mean keep it ... your your dignity I said you can go as long as you went\nNow I'm a big ... will never go back okay so I have a quick and why I think the Republican in the Senate to come up with a new law that if you all one one thousand of anything you can register as a minority and call it the Warner\nI like this idea and and it would be great if someone would proposed is in state legislatures and in the in the Congress\n... yes yes do it right now and say if you are one one thousand anything\nYou're entitled to affirmative action you are and I went to a college admissions on on a on the same basis as anyone else in ... and ... and you don't even have to take a DNA test you just got to consult with the DNA of with a with a biologist that's it 'cause that's all she did actually\nBecause in the business world you could register at the mill ask him out and get all the work up front ... have a\nAlone when we're talking about federal grant some federal grant\nYet to be to to be a female of Indian descent\nAs as a tremendous advantage tremendous advantage so why would start yeah yes yes right by this is why you need to run for Congress my friend [laughter] okay so you're not out there\nBut I have I been despite what I'm thinking\nWell working for Trump it's working for Trump to raise a problem with proposed in something like that in my bag [laughter] I was fine with me that's how long\nIt will pass in a heartbeat and then he will be up it looks like an idiot\nEverybody should be entitled to what he did yeah because and they call the Elizabeth Warren act and then the whereas like you say whereas Elizabeth Warren of unproven and at most one one thousand twenty fours Indian heritage is listed on the Harvard faculty as a person of color\nUm there's this same privilege I mean you talk about the beneficiary of white privilege she is oh yeah no I mean that that should be a very er everybody\nThey said it was good enough for her good enough for me and you know what here's a here's the thing I don't care I mean do you have any ancestors in the United states that go back to the Seventeen hundreds or even the sixteen hundreds and I've got a host of them I I I'm big on that genealogy stuff I Love digging around on it when I have spare time I've got\nCousins of ancestors going back to the sixteen hundreds in this country the first one I found in this country was sixteen thirty or by sixteen eighty three there I think I had like two dozen\nYou can't tell me that some point between then and now somebody didn't didn't fool around with some Indian girl somewhere you know ... ... happened so I probably am as much as American indian and she is where where's my Harvard faculty appointment\nThat's what I'm saying I work out a call um\nWell it back or media with your elected official or just packs\nNo I'm not I quit oh I didn't realize how didn't run again or you weren't elected official we're we've never had always been a ... year yeah I was done a rental car women and I spoke to a you're a sucker I [laughter] I have a great thanks I tried to seven to nine to do it if you want to get into this\nAnd that the spark he's on the phone hey buddy going on\nYou know you go to a\nAnyway I take exception to what Jack said the other day about Elizabeth Warren age you know she's an engine for Pete's sake she sleeps in it keep the company has been a good night's sleep in her life you've got to scrounge around for food to buffalo it's not easy being in Indian\nTo buffalo so that makes it tough enough to be president is what you're saying you\nKnow she's she's a moron [laughter] yeah really [laughter] anyway that's all I did I Try to get you yesterday but I I was busy working in a well everybody has to work and I tried to stay on and um but anyway keep up the good work sales and I do I\nOwe knocked it out in the bar is a plus go there you go okay thanks littering there were two of them on the line so\n\nThat was a great call that was a great great call our number two seven to nine two to eight if you want to get into seven to nine two to eight\n\nTotal crumb they could have just had a coded Krohn\nBack in the sixteen hundreds of catch Elizabeth Warren's [noise]\nAlleged uh [noise] I'm going to take one of these tests jak I I've been I've been resisting I didn't want to see I have my DNA but you know what if they want your

you know camp I I don't know if it this way in your business do you ever try to improve the quality of stuff around the office and you get pushed back\nAll the time okay we're experiencing that here on news and you just change its change they don't like to change but we were reluctant to change but you never grow if you don't change and here's what I say our callers are the best\nIn the business period and a story and because of it I Know that they will rise to the gym in general I Know that because the color seminars now over three weeks old\nAnd they're doing better than they ever have\nThey're doing better than they ever had it's working yeah I'm In in the ratings continue to grow so if if someone wants to turn it off below zero don't care she's apparently not listening anymore so right hell with it right on\nWell I get a lot of feedback or I'm not talking about Debbie by the way I loved it because nothing right go ahead ... an hour zone there than it is [laughter]\nBut uh well I you know I kind of came in at the tail end of their\nBacks okay I'm Glad you're here because you're going to tell us and and I I Know we do this every year this is the time

not going through 'cause I don't want to make a woman feeling worse and she feels probably a but let's just say that people our listeners are loving the new color seminar\nThey're loving it um and they listen you know hey\nWell they must not hate it because I don't get any text well none zero will just fine this is\nWhat I'm saying though I mean people want a good program that they can turn into at nine o'clock in the morning and they could listen to for three hours while they work or they go about their life while they do whatever they want\nAnd callers need to add to the program not take away from the program I instituted the new color seminar because I went back and listen to some shows one weekend\nAnd I thought our callers are just getting a little too rambling unwind and windy or windy I guess you'd say\nIt it just got to the point where you know if you take twenty five calls a day and only the average show will take twenty or twenty five calls Sunday's will take forty let's say it's a day we take forty calls and everybody in that call takes Fifteen seconds to ask our doing\nAll right forty times Fifteen the body can do a little mental Methodist six hundred right six bats that ten minutes ten yeah that ten minutes is a third of an hour of talk time that's gone back and how we're doing you know we've we've wasted a segment and a half\nAsking how we're doing I I think people would rather do a segment avenues and informative insight from callers and and uh at witty banter and that's fine and if you don't like the way we're enforcing the new color rules and you're going to threaten to turn it off fine I can assure you something I can assure you one thing the woman who made the complaint is listening as we speak\nShe's losing energy she can't logic to complain about the way of treating her\nBecause then she'll betray the fact that she's listening but I guarantee you she's listening why jak gamble because who listens air body including people who\nOh well she called us worse than that and she brought you in on it you had nothing to do with it I Know that's the that's the part that angered me the most well no no you know what I mean amongst she misspelled my name I probably would have done well ours yeah I probably would have done any of this and she's about well I didn't know her name to ours runs with Baron\nOr number to live and to nine two to eight who's this\nIs James James what's going on\nThat day you mentioned I'm by myself I wished that started by a as calling\nYes yes you are right in ... I don't know about famous I mentioned people on this program [laughter]\nOf one of 'em that I'm Glad you mentioned but uh as best I hated it as a call in and then a ... a saying in a cast and then eventually a failing house yeah was a Sean Hannity\nOh yeah that is true you know Jim Rome said he started out that way too and I know a on a on a ... and I'm given props because he runs a good show a John lung chores started out that way as well he called in he started as a call in and was asked eventually to come in and hosts the show so I I think it's a a a very common way James for people to get into the radio because who knows James\nYou may be up here one day oh now I'm too old and a song talking\n[laughter] I Wish you up it's a skill [laughter] we can get you there is a pretty sad that you know\nMuch certainly tiny shame say you know what I Love ... I Do too he's a great call her a great addition is the ... baseball fanatic yes yes and he he likes ... and I know a lot about sports um\nBut now that the ... I guess he's bringing that up because I brought it up last time in the context of\nThat's one reason why you want to be a good color you never know what is going to lead to plus she went over who all the hosts were on this station and I think almost most of them not all of them but but a lot a lot of them started out scholars Joey did and he started out as the\nInternet and then sort of worked his way you're talking about joy ... there were Clark has a distinctive style and they and they made it work you made it works his style on that are on almost a podcast 'cause it's a podcast styles are very distinctive style from a government talk radio\nBut they don't go into the six o'clock hour with the topic in mind or\nYou just you're asked to be on the program and then you kinda go wherever Joe he wants to go and it may or may not have anything to do with your field of expertise on what you do for a living\nIt may be you know ... it's a great change that it's random there's randomness to there's no doubt about it it's a very distinctive style and I like I think it works I guess it's I think it's the future of talk radio you know just\nNot necessarily news covering as much night hyperbolic like we are\n... never been so hurt in my life [laughter] you haven't 'cause I hit the nail on the head who's this\nBarren great here hey buddy how are you\nGo ahead oh I don't want to get off topic but no there's not right but I really would like your jak opinion on this thing the thing you know ... last night about just what three hundred three ... al ... white law\nNow are is on voters about them that are like ...\nI really like no you're fine don't hang up\nHold on I don't have any insight on me and I do okay go ahead Jacqueline Jacqueline left that you think there's like a thousand Hondurans who are making\nTheir way up through Mexico to come into the United states and Trump said this morning you do that you come up here no more aid for two or\nDoes that what he says he did good I thought this was I thought this happened in the spring that they had the big train coming up well it was but it wasn't Hondurans are saying there's a great\nIt it's a documentary about people migrating from Central America through Mexico to the United states is a fantastic movie not sympathetic to the plight of the immigrant obviously it's on Netflix or\nIt's it's kind of anti us immigration policy and all that but it does give you some keen insight into what these people are facing in their home countries some of them are coming for economic reasons because their desks to do some of them are coming for political reasons frankly cause they they're not destitute where they're from they actually have a pretty good life but they want a a different life they want to\nBut it's a it's an interesting documentary I should find the name of it I bet if you just looked up you know I think the cover of the documentary had a bunch of people sitting on top of the train and a lot of it a lot of the documentary takes place on the top of these\nFreight train mhm\nBecause a lot of people use those freight trains to cover great distances in Mexico that they otherwise would have to reverse by foot\nAnd they ride on the top of the ... and it's not just one or two people were talking thousands of people on each train\nAnd they fall off and some people die and you know people get sick along the way and they have to get abandoned or some people just abandon their journey halfway through because they're tired of it and they want to you know they don't like the groups are with whatever it is a really really cool documentary\nAnd I and I'm a big fan of this I talked to a liberal yesterday who would not click on a link accent\nBecause the claim was that the source was biased okay yeah that's true the socialist buys all sources are biased left or right there's no central source there's no median stores even places that claimed to be a median source ended up by us she might as well declare your biased and just to understand going in that the ... right\nBut I like watching documentaries that lean left I like watching Michael Moore documentaries I like watching documentaries about the plight of immigrants that lean lend announcing I'm and document the dance Eagleman documentary lane done\nYeah didn't lean left or right wing Don ah but I liked it\nBecause you know up front that it's not balanced and you're not trying to figure out halfway through it wait a minute which side of these people on what what do they try to get me to believe you know they're trying to convince you\nIt's like a courtroom and maybe that's it maybe it's because of the the legal training legal background but I like knowing that each side is presenting a biased argument\nYou don't hire a lawyer to try to be unbiased no you hire a lawyer to go in there and convince the judge and the jury you're right so that you can go home at the end of the day and after prison or you can win a bunch of money and not not end up you know in a wheelchair with no compensation\nSo I like the adversarial system I liked the adversarial system and a half ago that we were talking about Honduras oh yeah oh yeah yeah the documents so there are people traipsing this way and I'm I'm Glad he said that yeah [noise]\nStop stop abusing America a stop abusing American foreign aid All right

to do to do it this way way up there all day and and\nDoing it in a good friend Notre Dame is orange Middle East expert hair coaches orange wasn't worth a damn worship thanks for having me again I really appreciate you are calling it I'm Sorry we're running or winning a little like maybe ... a portion of a piece for you to give you the latest update or\nThink of the moment the two very different tracks were saying the investigation ... what's going on in the culture that behind me and that must be a diplomatic push which has highlighted by text you pump payers trip to Saudi Arabia and that is the one\nThat is growing and speed very quickly there is a real ... now the talk in Saudi Arabia as well as the U.S speaking to find a way forward through this without causing too much disruption\nPeople pay arrived in with math in Riyadh by the Saudi foreign minister to bat need an enemy thing with ... ... he met with the powerful crown prince Mohammed build and sell them and\nThat's actually ... thank you both of them for that commitment since the whole thing I found some time in the investigation of du Jamal ... says the parents and then they had a private meeting and no doubt that would have been some tough talking that because they don't want to find a way through the night there was a breakthrough yesterday when the report suggesting Saudi Arabia was going to accept\nResponsibility for the matter of getting the calls that behind me they were going to say it was an interrogation gone wrong carried out by rogue agents with no responsibility for amount of time and time and we haven't heard those reports yet but that apparently is what may be walked outside and look how many hours a day to sell out new developments for the investigation in as simple\nJust an hour twenty minutes where receiving reports I may pay you to suggest package will doctors are saying they now have evidence from inside the closest off they carried out that touch the show he was in the\nMud inside that and not investigation came to the days off the show you went missing this house has long been required the access to the consulate died again late that night yesterday went on for about four and a half hours all around the nine out ten about full time in the morning and it does indicate that was a real extensive search going on\nIs written I've always said they knew exactly where I could show he was killed in the building and from what John said the outside that UV light\nYou know folks and plans Saudi Arabia the secretary of state heading over there now to try to get some answers about what happened to the Saudi embassy inside turkey\nYou know if what happened who's to blame well I Know there's nothing happens in Saudi Arabia was out in the U.S knowing it who's MD I have the thirty three year old ... suggested them over other people he founded the existing team\nAnd I think he's on a on a bad track\nI can never do business with Saudi Arabia again until we get this behind this right and what does that mean that means I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia as long as there's guys in charge you're selling the crown prince has to leave this up to them but I'm not going to end their biggest offender on the floor of the United States Senate this guy is a wrecking ball\nInteresting they let's talk about what they can do to us and what we can do to them in in a situation where they need us more than we need them\nOr is it is it is Jill ... is\nThere a key player in Middle East diplomacy for us correct\n[noise] well they aren't they aren't uh they were before uh they\nUh badly strained Gulf Cooperation council um and uh uh remove cutter from it or not actually literally but the sanctions against hotter\nOr how how we can chatty rabies hand among the Sunni Arab countries\nUm and also with the United states there's been some real violence about whether or not this was really a good idea given the cutter is a huge military base where the United states where um\nThe other thing that's interesting is we used to rely on Saudi Arabia for oil an interesting ten years ago we imported fourteen thousand barrels of oil a day from ...\nA hundred thousand that's a very small amount\nAnd most of it comes in to a single shot he raped and who run a oil refinery in Louisiana so we are almost independent from Saudi Arabia and if I had to regroup where just side to cut off that eight hundred thousand barrels a day we could ramp up production or buy it from someplace else fairly quickly\nOn the other hand um Saudi Arabia buys almost all of its weapons from the United states\nThey have um possibly a hundred billion dollars of weapons on order what um what they have done is signed kind of letters of interest that doesn't mean they're actually going to buy them they\nAre contracted now for about eight billion dollars of weapons now the president has said that they could buy those weapons from Russia or China that's not really correct um they are set up\nClaimed a and maintain to operate American weapons so if the United states were to say okay until\nThe crown prince steps down and tell you a knowledge what happened to uh\nTo uh uh ... we're going to suspend those arms sales I think that would put a lot of pressure on chatty rabid they really don't want to buy weapons other than ours they did by British again I I met with the current king many years ago\nCan you looked at me and said we'd much rather buy American weapons we don't go to like the British weapons [laughter] why didn't address to send a message to the Americans that we want to buy your weapon stop putting these restrictions on\nSo I think that if the United states were to to say seriously if Senator Graham were to say seriously if you don't make good on this and acknowledge that show was murdered it's there aren't serious repercussions for the people responsible for doing it\nWe will suspend arms sales I think Saudi Arabia would have to respond to a they\nWill not turn to Rochefort China they really don't want to buy those left and the only Chinese weapons they bought were\nSome long range ballistic missiles they bought back in Nineteen eighty nine they realized they really aren't very good uh and I think that's pretty much the end of the idea of buying Chinese or Russian weapons by Saudi Arabia\nWhen I was a is a situation with compatibility admitted that they find a model aircraft and then trying to substitute that with the Chinese model that doesn't that network\nThat does not work out some of the way it does not work all their pilots are trained in the United states all of their maintenance facility is who really operated by American contractors to a six and a modernized they're they're active deans\nUm they're buying a new set of a modern ... a F. fifteens have sixty and um they operate a lot of American equipment they operated American Ground landed American tanks\nSending that the American ... tanks those your state of the art tanks they have no intention of buying Russian tanks which really aren't as good and they're just not set up to to run them they're not they they have a crane for them\nThey have a set up to maintain them so\nI think that ah there's very little chance they will by anybody it's weapons other than weapons from the United states here you go ahead ... one more thing they have they been very clever and spending their defense contractor run the United states and that's one limitation\nThey've got the bench contracts in Montana Arizona in St Louis Alabama and other places in congressional district where they do create if your job so\nThere is some political support for selling Saudi Arabia what\nDid you understand you that the highest model do they go to and fighters\nThe

at the top part of belief yeah\nSound there's just so many questions about it and that's one of the main reasons that the secretary of state Mike Pompeo is of course on his way to Saudi Arabia to try and figure out first hand what exactly happened so that's one story that we're watching tonight and then the other one is of course Senator Elizabeth Warren who's receiving just a lot of pushback\nFor these that releasing those DNA test results providing at least some evidence of her Native American lineage anywhere from one sixty fourth to one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American to be exact\nTonight the Cherokee Nation is accusing her of making a mockery out of DNA tests and it's legitimate uses will also dishonor ring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens while President Obama is twenty twelve campaign manager says quote argue to something you want\nBut why twenty two days before a critical election where we must win the house and Senate and save America why didn't Senator Warren half the new her announcement now why can't dance ever stay focused so it's pretty much erases any doubt that Senator Warren has her eye on twenty twenty and then the other story that were monitoring what we were talking about\nIs of course these reports that Saudi Arabia is preparing to admit that they accidentally killed Saleem journalists to ... that it was an unauthorized interrogation gone wrong now Fox cannot confirmed these reports but the president\nHas been briefed about them his secretary of state Mike Pompeo has now on his way to Saudi Arabia to meet the king

was assumed that because there were really were immigrants\nThat documented in going into Ellis Island from Italy to New York so you'd think quarter million well once he got his DNA results but not quite the case and those people that were in Italy weren't quite Italian so were they come from the ... is he is he's more of a British than the average British citizen\nMy roommate really so why would they depart from Italy versus what do you mean from what he's trying to figure out\nIs a there there's all sorts of pay he's in his weaving in and out he's going through her old records and trying to put together all these family trees and there are other people actually there in Italy ladies and communication whether it's complicated and we don't know quite the whole story it does not

... things were hanging on for me I appreciate it you wanted to know about the midterms and here's how it kind of sizes are\nRight now I think we can pick up the U.S Senate say they will keep Arizona ... will definitely Cape Tennessee I think we have I Will pick up north Dakota no matter what I think will pick up a Indiana Missouri and possibly Florida\nA possibly Montana but you could see anywhere from ... to eight fifty five US Senators fifty four would be a strong\nNumber yeah and but now I don't really understand\nOh and that we have such a great possibility that it the but the house things to think about all reports it's jeopardy\nThat's a great question and here's kind of this simple answer those seeds that I mention or and basically red states\nAnd so the the leaning goes towards the uh go show is a Republican the other thing is the cabin a boat basically solidified those boats and because it's a U.S Senate and US Senators come from and I'm a judges and so\nThat is very important to people in those areas so when you look at where do you like dislike about Claire McCaskill her boat\nOr no vote on Kavanaugh is really weighing in on her same thing with Don clearly the same thing with a high camp and I think it's the same thing a Nelson but now since he got some other issues that are there but this was driving that then you get to a ... a congressional district\nIn congressional district has got this kind of suburban feel to it\nAnd we're Trump does not do well is in suburban in states like California even in orange county which is typically very very very Republican but where we have to hope is that the Dems do show up there but you could be anywhere from losing\nFifteen cities in the house to losing forty states in the house\nWhile that's incredible uh you know I Hope it doesn't turn out that way I can hold onto it and I got to say that you know get a lot of people are now or the price\nThat that ...\nYou know go ahead and mitigate a summer of ... kind of opposite races all of the terms that mitigate a lot of the a Democrat but for the house race\nBecause I don't think they got a split there but uh I don't see how you know they got some ... in a boat or a real conservative senator would go in it but a vote or I you know level are louder\nThey yeah and the problem isn't in the um\nIsn't in the red states and the congressional seat\nIs in the state said or purple or or deep blue that's that's the problem is kind of phone you're being you're basically none house seats\nThat are in jeopardy they're ... four of them are probably going to be laws you've got Minnesota we were we might pick up one but Pennsylvania we could lose to their Florida we can pick up to\nOur gotcha okay\nWell then so that I appreciate your

by the deputy director Andrew McCabe about President Trump and ... and we don't know anything more than that\nWe know that they list a mic came as a witness in the investigation not a subject uh but

I think this is the question everybody wants to talk about and as a young man um emotionally single young man it's complicated\nI ah I don't think I'd miss that they're rich they're fine but I don't think I Would a mess around with that because it seemed like everybody mess around with the car Daschle and goes a little nuts in their own unique way\nYeah where are you Rob a chance I think she Rob and maybe it's just that maybe I'm being a sex this year but he was just a women and the guard ... maybe ... does that now include Bruce ... is a biological man but he's real woman he's all women\nAnd this is what I mean like Bruce Jenner\nBruce Jenner is you was in the like ooh we're like the alpha ... male\nAnd now after you know hanging out with the ... the pit of me a woman have you seen her new boyfriend Caitlin new boyfriend yeah Caitlin has a boyfriend ... chocolate wow good for\nOr drinks usually for two years to taxpayer here\nAnd you don't get punished for that six years later and so you already in a way had changed like you're already growing and building a life is and I mean did you have any worry that that would ever come up or did it come out of nowhere [noise]\nHonestly I I just felt like he came out of nowhere and I had left that company but ... years in a\nAnd and but you knew that was something yeah I I I didn't know that you know right now that there was some things that you know we shouldn't have been doing and\nThese were sentenced to Eighteen months ... who's ... did you have to do the whole ... thing\nBut I did a year in federal prison is a federal camp in Mariana okay um and I did eight months in a halfway house and that eight months three months or what about three and four months at a halfway house and remain on monster okay\nNow what is it like in the the federal prison what is life like there\nYou know just being honest it wasn't bad ... you know watching TV in hearing stories you think you're going to get gang raped or beat up and things like that you know so um [noise]\nIt was actually like\nCanada being at home just without your kid\nRhyme one is is you have this new group of people here\nA year that you don't know and you have rules you have to abide by their rules so hey you go to sleep when we say go to sleep you get up let me say it up so okay\nSo it's not like it ... the experience itself for them and beyond August you're in prison you're missing your children uh you're missing your life that you've already been building but at the the actual day to day life in prison wasn't some crazy horrified traumatizing thing we're like give I think about me going to prison\nI'm going to have a very rough times are tough here just to ... they are and not\nKnow this this is my question um during this time or who was your kids with\nTheir dad that her\nWas able to talk to you or were you able to call them at this time yeah we're going back and forth letter and stuff like that\nYeah we're able to talk on the phone okay yeah 'cause I Know that\nThere's something so is there\nAs you are I'm sure the halfway house helps but is there a big transition where it's like now trying to find a job trying to do when you have a lot more ... you have to mark down I imagine on job applications that I've done this or that I went through this that's\nAlways a struggle for anyone who has been\nConvicted of a misdemeanor or a felony is it's always a struggle trying to find employment so um [noise]\nI sympathize with those you know because they they want to get their last back on track you know run they they they want to do right but I notice that with some of them they fall victim back to what they know because nobody wants to give them a chance\nWell and yeah you fall back into the same pattern and the this is why you see people ... yeah yeah and it I mean look what I mean this getting your I think your story's pretty unique in the sense that\nYou'd already moved on from that active yeah so when you get out do what is your first step as you're getting out\nUm I moved in with my parents um my parents have always been supportive of myself and my siblings and I had my first job it O'Reilly's ... Thomas bank you're doing Thomas [laughter]\nUm he gave me a second chance and I work Monday through friday even though I was still like ... or even when I came home from prison just to get back to where I was I Can't work we can't I can do Monday through friday you know like a morning shift so he gave me an eight to morning shift at all rallies and\nI worked making four hundred dollars every two weeks\nDamn\nWell but I mean it's something yeah and then start from there and that's the thing we always talk about it and you know there's got to be more to life than making money and consume and things but there's some that would be said about having paid employment it gives you some schedule it gives you\nSome structure in life and I know the the worst most miserable times in my life is when I wasn't working when I was just kind of laying around like there's something to be said about if you don't have to necessarily be like paid work like a a morning show yeah\nBut if you have some things that gives you some sort of purpose\nAnd structure it really can help and helps you from falling into a worst habits are and also it was there a major you've answer to this but the relationship with your children after you get out was there any major differences are\nUm I think I noticed a major difference in both of my kids I'm with my daughter there wasn't really that mommy attachment anymore it was that daddy attachment bladder she ... she's always been a daddy's girl but\nIt's like she's asleep with me every night and when I came home I couldn't give it to sleep with me like why that couldn't happen that once people but you know how ... it with my son\nUm I think he battled with the fact that I wasn't here for that crucial year that he needed me because the plans were for him to go out in the military college he didn't do neither\nUm he's a good kid he works um right now for rings but um he feels like you know I can and let them down and I feel the same way too\nI have you been ... I'm sure you've been working to amend that\nYou say that he never went off to college or Brian ... to military you know the plants that we we had\n... plans I mean it's a ... it's tough though I like to joke a lot to talk about you know there are things in my life that in the series is that I really do regret things yeah I mean of course that happen outside of your control\nUm in some within but I Love this idea that you are trying to create now medium where people can share their stories you already have organization to reach out and say this\nIsn't the end of your life it it will change your life will it will most definitely do that but it's not the end of the world is really not we just have to work a little harder\nA lot harder ... um to to get what we want and what we feel like we did well in my ... I think sometimes in a ... there's an over emphasis Russia and non violent crimes there was an over emphasis on punishment\nWhich it can serve people are out of Seattle because they get a punishment that correct their lives and works\nBut I'm thinking of especially non violent crimes of okay you literally pay your debt so just steal two thousand dollars pay them back that money plus some yeah\nAnd I shouldn't make victims whole um make whoever you wrong whole plus some is should be more of the the sense of justice in that situation that's just my comment sense there how you'd work that was legal reforms that's all I'm Talking about tonight or well you can ask Kemp K. that a good look\nDon't bring the car Daschle ... well I'm having a serious\nDesign but I'm but I'm just saying she went to the White House and somehow convince Trump that hey we do need prison reform and don't don't don't don't know I\nDon't know the messenger and you know I Know it was okay I I had a messenger\nRight well and that's the that's where it's funny that only made like Trump is a character or ride but uh he seems for all the the things he says it's like okay if you can sit down with somebody I think you can convince some certain things I think he I think Trump could go either way to\nBe on as long as it helps when Trump and do it yeah of course of course but one of the questions I have to Utah to like as far as this duck you series a documentary do you think it's going to change the narrative\nOf like when ... when women get out will make\nLocal businesses more susceptible to hiring I feel like ... and stuff like that\nGetting to know the individual instead of\nLooking at what someone put on a piece of paper will actually let you know you know that person and um you guys know me and you're only in my life not McEwan narrow your amazing girl he would've never thought the million years\nThat I went out to ... to federal people and it's ...\nLike that word choice to press like I'm interested in will why exactly what was the story and\nWell I I think so like orange is the new black it's kind of given prison a certain narrative that when you hear you know that this person was in front of the you have this idea of what it was like and and what she said like she just described by federal prison is nothing like that you know\nIt wasn't all I'm not trying to go back to that oh of course it wasn't all summer camp well I mean from I take it in a version of oranges and invite there's a lot of lesbians blow for some that's in both and that's not federal prison either\n\nMom and I got to get this on line [noise]\nCrazy questions and\nNew album came out well\nNew release\nIn Nineteen eighty three people that are the bald after he died found a little tape\nButterfly golfing cocaine\nAnd it actually turned out to be thirty minutes straight into the\nPiano playing music\nOr any sort of stopping and starting and what's the\nOf the microphone\nWhole coffee and go to the the soldiers got married ...\nThe old things pretty chill\nAnd just let alone and the piano recorded on the cassette who they found that cause a ...\nPut it out you know bottom end of September\nIntimate kind of\nSpike Lee to use this in the\nWhich I don't even see in\nBrand than you are saying all fairly new one or two a couple of partial to see that oh yeah\nOh I was wondering um\nLike as far as the doctor said he was like well you'll be covering like the families like how it affected them that their parents or cheese or cousins were out of the household and stuff like that\nYeah I can we will be touching on a lot with the ... theory hum I didn't want to mention that the casting call this Saturday um October twenty eight\nOkay okay that's a that's a ... now has this been something like a labor of love some you've just been totally with for a long time you know I've\nBeen working on these poor people you know I you know to throw you out there and I have I mean we've we've had\nConversations about this and I just thought it was um do you know especially because it's something that you went through yeah so a lot of the best art to me is self reflection personal growth and stuff like that like it'll be that type of thing\nYeah it most definitely will um and and that's what we want to do we just want to show\nThat you know\nWere labeled as buildings and and and at times is harsh\nThere you know but um\nWe're just normal people who just want a second chance to show that we don't get it right you know\nAnd you know what I also thought that this duck you series it'd be something good maybe you could show local young ladies at high school level middle school level who's thinking about trying to make the easy buckets them and then you know it may detour yeah I think it'd be something good like that like a a ghetto scared straight or something [laughter] [laughter]\nHey but it is now the light of all because if somebody that you see every day yeah somebody in your community that they went through this and that can tell you what's going on but it\nSounds like though is not going to be like we've I've even seen scared straight stuff and\nI mean some of it's it's like well damn yeah I was thinking about doing that here [laughter] um it doesn't sound like you're trying to scare people know where where in most definitely not trying to share me scare people we just want to just you know show\nOur side yeah our story where people are not just the label our struggles apparently still struggle oh you know things aren't all peaches and cream over here okay [laughter] um layers of course\nI Wish every night ... inches in great health force\nAnother thing I Hope you show is like a lot of your success as as you've you've come a
