programing\nSomething we try to do on the show for many years is to get us to laugh at the everyday things in life you\nSorry are suffering for Nineteen we've been having some fun in the San Francisco or in fact now that the weather's starting to get cooler in the upper levels of the atmosphere a chilling we're seeing now we've seen some things in the sky and I thought\nI was going to take Terry temperature because there was a trail grid in the western sky and he says\nLook at the numbers down and it's one thing if you see one thing in the sky\nThat reminds you or looks like something but this was a stack of trails\nIn the western sky and at one point and the stack under the southern end of the stack of trails yeah [noise]\nI'm not making this up you could see very clearly a three five and eight seven and a one\nHonest to God it looked like it was stamped and do the blue\nNow one thing you can say on that just you know coincidence that was just plain freaky that was for so there was no need to take your temperature because I saw two\nMetric stupid me I meant to mention what we came back up [noise]\nAnd then the other thing that we love to do when the when it cools off and we get the paper trails for correctional flights Terry told me about this app for your phone called flight radar twenty four [noise] it's only a few bucks at the store\nAnd basically what it does is just display here location that one I like to do the gang for us as as we were sitting outside checking traveling couple of minutes ago traffic is fine so we looked in the heavens and we saw two vapor trails not next to each other woman was behind the other\nAnd I like to guess where they're going you're good at it to ... you know facing or they said that looks like Chicago to Miami\nAnd maybe one well\nI was wrong on the origin nation both flights to taking off from Memphis woman's going in Miami was going to Tampa 'cause you gotta figure emphasis on one of them went directly over us\nAnd\nYou gotta figure if they're out they're creating a trail which has to be well above thirty thousand feet they're not going to Atlanta certainly he lived to be much lower to land there unless you wanted to free the passengers\n[laughter] I'm wrong about the study of origin but you're correct that both flights came from the same city yeah and\nIt was Memphis they were FedEx flight ... that's interesting that they are going to go up at the same time hasn't for basically Florida [laughter] but ah bringing this up not doing pressure was by geography guessing skills it's just a fun thing to do because\nOf the positioning yourself and make sure you're facing do northwest Easter whatever north always makes the most sense if you look over head I think my greatest we saw\nBack in the spring and I could tell that the plane that was creating it was huge because that's all four engines that's from the ground yet so I knew it was like seven eighty seven or one of those who jumbo jets\nAnd I said that looks like it's going to Mexico or someplace and sure enough Mexico City Mexico City was the destination that flight so you just you seem a little plane icon that matches where you are and where the the trailers and it'll tell you a little spray the information but what's weird [noise]\nAh there was a flight on there was a plane leaving a trail [noise]\nAnd there's all kinds of trails up there today you better just hanging you're not evaporating there's tang and they don't do that kind of sanction doesn't do that it shouldn't the ugly I play mostly when I kept the aircraft I kind of on the screen for that no information available military man [noise]\nYeah what was the law the the commercial flights have to put the trans ponder has to be picked up right by law that happen a couple of years ago so if it was civilians they would be something there [noise]\nI just thought it was it is interesting mighty interesting but you really good at this this usually you get the the

fifty years for the full story to emerge from behind and official wall of secrecy and blame\nTo remarkable journalists have worked for years to tell the whole story\nI was totally blown away by their

but he returns to the program coming up and just a few minutes and in a sense he is returning to his roots\nYou know the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe it was ten years ago to discuss his first book the ... project\nWas a typical day polite as boots on the ground investigation this time of the big butt legend David spent two years among the ... tribe to hear their tails legends and to apply police in forensic methods to figure out what was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest\nAs it turns out a course similar sightings have been reported all over the world and wild ... better known these days for his investigations of missing people\nHe's never stopped thinking about or working on the big foot mystery and tonight he's back with a book that's a great resource for anyone interested in this subject it traces the sasquatch story through newspaper reports and historical records that name big what has been around as we know since Nineteen fifty eight\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the ... police police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders\nAnd this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big story in Hooper that live miles away who someone coming into town I started to think about my police days and I used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and he would sit down with a witness be\nAble to draw the sketch from just the witness statements and the results were amazing but I wanted something that a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond unbelievable look\nWas assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for\nThe state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person and a Harvey and I met in right away we just cook like brothers\nAnd wouldn't Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and draw the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due the sketch of the suspect that is how accurate this man is\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes\nThey immediately accept and\nArmy and I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends we did two books that Hooper project and then we did to follow a book called tribal big foot or he went outside of hoop and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd I'm kind of how it started\nAh you said you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps and the big world right\nOh bingo a certain I started the most vocal the most audacious\nThe most vulgar\nAre probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause\nSince they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kinda went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of a background or\nAre they still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around who put Andrew the sketches Harvey myself in Harvey's wife Gina ... also an agent for in Oklahoma we were set in stone disbelief\nBecause the sketches or very human like yeah they were huge out I had hair all over the body there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss\nAnd they didn't look like apes they didn't have that\nApe characteristics that you would think of in a face an a chest et cetera and it was just shocking and when the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady and to a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that if the exactly what you look like\nAnd when you talk about the older they would consistently say this is another tribal people is on animals is their people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with them at least at college distance right\n[noise] yeah it in the tribal area I met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nSo one thing about the ... areas the trinity river great salmon and steal headed area\nA has just so much wildlife\nAnd if you drive through Hooper from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains than I've ever seen anywhere in the world\nAnd there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seeing eating it\nAnd you don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law a man as a former law man at the state of the evidence about this whether you'd say there is that there is there sufficient evidence that something is real here or that we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a a PHD name Melba catch them Dr catch him\nWas one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blood cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America the test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many of them were were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA and then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva\nAnd all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA and what the showed was that the ... went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the females side\nTo the Arab region to ah Jerusalem to a Jordan ended that part of the world and this is when I was sent to a gym bank and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in this\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her write a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab a completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could've been compromised\nYet as the paper was written before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce smell but two of their ... brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\nShe listen to some of this but she didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you ... ... all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science which people don't and\nThey read news brief here and there and think it's true the reality is when you're\nWith a scientist who reads that science find the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten samples so tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big bought wild bent and giants use Harry noon and night night I mean big but ... air took us into the break\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that they'll but did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now is that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her\nThat people are saying going to say well how do you know that's big for their well the ... looks different than any other mammal here in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell a physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hires in North America and when you look at a big but here it's an entirely different so if it if the\nBut if you pay attention and all of these DNA experts are not using her hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts\nHave figured out the formula that number did to extract this DNA and to get the results and there's a lotta there's a lot of attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together\nIt almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like a UFO world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to different levels\nOf ... to the point of raw Gillette\nMaterial um and ah will stab people in the back end will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence\n... at a minimum of\nPeople were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's humid but it's not all human\nYou know and that's that's the part\nBut the second says it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with a human ... and when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that the\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kinda surmise that\nThe a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appears that a big foot was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe it blend on it well we got the DNA off that other times it linked to a game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big for look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this that people haven't read the study they've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia that data and read the report because it's available online and see that the\nHurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit to Melba she's a genius scientists that figure this out [noise] um it's unfortunate\nUh yeah because it got down to a thrown under the under the bus\nAs she did as well um ... you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or are they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it\n...\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I made a lot of times these descriptions and there were some amazing working here there's some really\nNickels or from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading it off and making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories the having the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eighty how did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed to make that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as a description twenty four used ape gorilla or monkey Ninety used giants and forty is something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U.S sixteen even Canada three in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it\nOr we're Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana live in New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six\nAnd then the numbers keep going down from there but\nAgain it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on the front page along with a\nNew article in the missing but I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants and big foot\n[noise] and one of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius is a lot of people say oh you know if you're overly this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the fame\nAnd he puts up a map of like big foot ... there's a appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes down like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything because you know what this map of because it was a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated the same location the the big fight\n[laughter] and\nBut it was his statement about a giant that were found in past centuries in mountains and in a excavations that really kinda got me thinking or these giant\nThe big for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories here in Nevada you know the pirates and shown to you have legends and stories about a big foot bones or a giant bones that were\nStashed and they came up in northern Nevada and are you ask what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\nWell why did these articles pointed to um some universities would get 'em at the the more likely candidate were all these went and it said in the articles was the Smithsonian yet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nLook back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book it's from the Maryland gives that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an account or a witness sees this on the cell for governor rubber an animal between twelve and fifty feet high\n... the head with it which is an equal proportions of the body the feet are two feet long and Harry uh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the descriptions semi modern descriptions of big\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds and I was stunned because nobody talks about it\nBut when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being except the head which is like you said an equal proportion to the body so I'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and\nNobody nowadays is ever brought this stuff up\nSo one of the articles I put in the tribal big foot book that nobody wants to talk about\nWas in Nineteen thirty four there was a series of trail site incidents in Washington where hikers and hunters and things were getting rocks thrown at them and they saw this figure that looked like a big foot well then they went and told the sure the share of who's going to get a policy together to go kill this thing\nTo visit our website at our home mortgage dot com

and this story this tragedy really touches a nerve in ways that I think we will explore over the next few hours for anyone who is not a student of naval history\nYou know the first time most of us probably heard of what little we know about the USS Indianapolis it can be traced to\nOne of the best scenes in the history of American movies is from blockbuster Spielberg movie jaws Robert Charles

she was hit by kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent her on the fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as\nThe victorious flagship of the world war two specific theaters um victorious that are now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nWhen general Leslie grows and the other leaders of Manhattan Project including President Truman\nDecided that they wanted to send the components of the atomic bomb little boy which would later ... to head to the forward areas\nAnd trim and did this a lot of uh a lot of people don't know that trim and did this before he even knew that he would use the bomb because at that time uh everyone thought that there would be\nAn invasion of mainland Japan so\nIndianapolis was elected to transport these novels components of the bombs she did that a native record breaking run to a Pearl Harbor\nAnd then pushed on to penny an island where she dropped off the components of the atomic bomb and then two days after that on July twenty eighth Nineteen forty five\nShe set out on what was going to be a routine voyage across those can see from Islam to the facility and an almost three west down shot\nAnd right when she was in the middle of the specific or Stevie middle of the Philippines these on July thirty is Nineteen forty five just a few minutes after midnight\nOr she intersected course with a Japanese submarine called I fifty eight commanded by lieutenant commander much Sara how she might have plush amount of fire exposed for he does it Indianapolis with two of them\nThe first one almost completely blew the fell off the shift Indianapolis with heavy cruiser\nThe second one hit her image shifts the vessel went down and twelve minutes and you know we've been talking longer than wealth than it it was very very ...\nThat's a a little under nine hundred made it into the water alive and when they made it into the water and those who survived their ruins were very optimistic if they were going to the rest and\nBut uh they weren't and they've spent five nights and four days in the water struggling to survive and died as you mentioned earlier they've they fought madness they've gotten hydration they've a shark or eventually they fought each other because of the madness\nAnd that is the story that most people know that Indianapolis\nShe was spotted completely by accident on the about mid day on the fourth the fourth day after five nights for days and the water and only three hundred and sixty men survive\nSarah secrecy place such an important part in this at every step of the way and it leads to tragedy threatened with tragic tragic results because of the secrecy of the what they were carrying and they continue to sort of continued over after they drop it off\nOr wanted to share with us the how secrecy or a ... which obviously was necessary military necessity or lead to tragedy and how you probably you interfered with your ability to get at the core of the story\nAbsolutely I mean there were multiple areas that held secrecy and the story that led to the demise of Indianapolis and ultimately the men being lost at sea for five days\nAnd you know first of which being how messages were transmitted across the Pacific during the war you know there\nWas a level of coding that had to be taken into consideration and you know one of the ships that\nIndianapolis was to report to when it arrived in the Philippines was unreal McCormack and the message he received was garbled\nAnd so you know protocol said that oh it didn't you know didn't come through clearly and no one asked for a repeat so they didn't even know Indian Indianapolis was supposed to be reporting to them you know that was one of the first thing\nI'm so when she didn't show up they didn't know she was supposed to show up\nYou know um aside from that there was\nProtocol that noncombatants shit arrivals didn't have to be reported and so when she didn't arrive lieutenant thought while I guess I don't have to report that either and so\nHe took it upon himself not to say anything even though he knew the ship was in there and these were all put in place you know to protect our vessels during wartime but the secrecy of that and the protocols ultimately lead to her not being found you know and then beyond that\nYou know we had broken the Japanese code at this time and there were a message trafficking going across the Pacific and the Philippines the reporting you know various subs in the area well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't want anyone to know that the codes had been broken and that we were using that and so\nYou know he should not have been there without an escort he should have had and taking a step back Indianapolis was not you know made really for combat it was made to get to a scene or to a battle quickly and\nHave guns and so she should've had something you know first of all the sonar and second of all that had\nAny calmer ability armored two and a former\nI mean she was part of the treaty cruisers so or armor was exceptionally sin compared to many of the newer shifts and so that was one of the reasons why she's saying so quickly uh you know so all of these things\nAnd so much of that played into the secrecy of the mission and why she was out there and why this information wasn't passed along to the captain who may have made different decisions knowing that there was a direct threat in its path\nTo me this was a difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I I Know there's been so many wrong stories in wrong conclusions made about what happened there then I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nI think a big part of it they mentioned is that I spent several years visiting with than spending time with their families talking with them that you know with no other interests other than learning their story\nAnd so they I think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and putting the story down on film or you know the screenplay and eventually the book and Linda's well when she came in we had this trust built in with these men that they knew and genuinely wanted to tell the\nAccurate story however heart and however long that would take we would tell the true story\nWell he was a it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters so you you get to know these people are a lot of the people who are characters of the book obviously didn't survives your piecing them together I guess from people who did know there but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS ... Indianapolis oh Lynn talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back to land on the Indianapolis story because really the man or before the crash and not just to to you know\nCircle back and the man who ferry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis when an army named Robert a nominee major name Robert for men\nAnd he had spent the last couple of years after the war running down all of the material that they feared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bomb uh on the continent of Europe\nThough one that messing with completely and then from and carry decision about components of little boy attending an island\nUm that is the final breathing better and the Europe and and if the if the conflict and so in writing the whole book we try to pull back that ran in bringing in a lot of and other characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view in addition to hush money we had him for the call and tell me you've got to leave and come ... commander\nAnd what we tried to do storage where to even to recognize it even those men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing what they\nWill tell you what do we I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break into a will come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... and some of the other central characters including captain McVeigh who took the brunt of the blame we'll be right back talking about the Indianapolis tragedy goes to goes down\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot he was the commander who cared for his men\nThere was a commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese that Marines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around banging on doors after ... radar and more technology for his marine because that means that marine didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of his brothers that commanders\nGo down to sell the grave for lack of technology they're caring had a wife he had three sons um and eventually in addition to his\nUm [noise] book which was called fun\nUm we were also able to interview his granddaughter a and it even more information about his later life half for\nAs we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because of the U.S Navy I mean they took the extraordinary step of having him testify at a court martial for captain McVeigh and then\nThey didn't really want to hear his version of of how things went but we'll we'll circle back around that I'm Sarah I Want to get to the moments right after these torpedo slam into the side of the Indianapolis\nA chaos breaks out of\nYou know we we've heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a those distress signal are not exactly true but sort of true why don't you pick up the story there tell us describe those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes hit\nSo you know the moon was behind clouds that had been an intermittent cloudy night and so and that was part of the reason why you know\nI don't know if we would say it's lucky for ... the clouds you just parted in the movie came out for just a moment enough for him to see the silhouette of the ship\nAnd so you know after it was struck him the power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the ship they couldn't communicate over the first time see you know the ... from the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship\nYou know over the speakers there was no one to tell people to report to battle stations they had to pass that from mouth to mouth well this is a six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship\nSo with the chaos happening and ships thinking and twelve minutes you have to imagine that compartments or flooding incredibly quickly you know the ship is starting to tilt first to the star bird and then it goes down by the bell\nSo men are being trapped inside the ship unable to skate from their compartments and you know Linda mentioned before they believe about three hundred and men went down with the ship\nAnd even further this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to the men people started abandoning ship very shortly after\nThe ship was torpedoed all the way until you know men went down with her and were able to escape so these men were spread out over a mile and a half\nIs what they believe and you know those who went down on and went off on the ... the low side they would have been with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve raft that\nThey believe got off the ship 'em but no standard protocol at that time was to go off the high side the port side well the majority of the men went off that side and there was no supplies so they weren't in rafts they were\nYou know somewhere in even in life jacket some were holding on to flotsam that they could find in the water as long as they could until they could get to someone who can help them you know fellow ship made or whomever\nAnd others had to just swim and tell a sailor would pass away and then everybody would help them take the life jacket off the dead sailor and put it on them\nI mean this was\nIncredibly chaotic so scary these are sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen year olds that had just got on the ship not some of them not even three weeks or a month earlier you know they just went on board right before the last mission\nDone really gone to any drills yet some didn't know how to swim and there and just thrown into the middle of the Pacific at midnight it's pitch black they're covered in fuel oil because in a you know in an effort to save the ship but the last moment\nWe kind of a written being actually released the fuel into the water and so this is very very thick oil that can only be transferred with heat so it's like par on these men and they can't tell who anybody is they can barely breed they're swallowing it their vomiting\nThere at this point they're trying to stay alive some have injuries and they won't last much longer\nI'm you know they they say that those who head injuries didn't really make it past the first day but the men who were able to escape without injuries were still suffering from the early stages of dehydration because of vomiting this fuel oil so no one's in really great shape\nYou know by the time the sun comes up the first morning but they're very optimistic that rescue is going to come because they believe there's a ship in the Philippines waiting for their rival\nAnd there wasn't you know there were attempts to get us to go out to just didn't go I guess they they they they they were successful exactly\nA couple of days it becomes clear that they know what's coming or if they're coming there they're going to have a hard time finding a because as as you describe in the book they're spread out all over the place and and these big waves are pushing the group's further and further apart right I'm\nLynn may be one to talk about that a little bit in this context there's incredible acts of heroism that you describe from some of these sailors who were doing their best to help everybody else and then at the same time there were some incredibly selfish acts of brutality that happen as well\nWell that's right um there were incredible acts of heroism and as you mentioned in as Sarah mentioned the currents they move that about one mile an hour in that area and they also moving these sort of giant eddies or world if you will\nAnd so two men that would be together\nIn the morning could be a mile apart by afternoon and and all the time these twelve foot swelled some days it's it's clear as glass says on the day of the rescue but Sunday's there these twelve swells along with these currents\nSo over time over the course of the the five nights and four days the men become spread out over a twenty five mile area\nAnd I'm One of the rescue pilots later wrote\nThat from altitude a rescue plain looking down on a situation like that the head of one man would be the size of a human hair scene in cross section or diameter from across the room so basically they were invisible\nAnd you mentioned acts of heroism acts of cowardice one ... one real hero was I'm\nA captain park he was the commander of the marine detachment that was aboard the ship and the largest swimmer group and the water the the the F ... mentioned the men in the water we're spread out initially over a mile and a half and then they just got further and further apart with those currents\nThe largest group that had nothing but life jackets was about four hundred men\nAnd captain park within that group and he really spent\nTwenty four hours a day trying to keep them in together the only resource that that group of men had besides their life jackets which not even all of them had life jackets\nWas a single line that was about a hundred feet long and so they foreign that line into a circle and the men were to tie themselves to the line and captain park would uh\nHelp the men that didn't have life jackets and several times he would get a life jacket from the dead sailor and then give it to another man who needed a life jacket and he did this numerous times and he would round up the stragglers and encourage everybody until finally on the third day he succumbed to hallucinations\nAnd and he died and when he died that group became very desperate because they thought wow if this brave men can't make it how are we all going to make it\nAnd then in terms of cowardice um you had precisely the opposite happening with with some men being a selfish\nSend men uh even officers taking place on a raft for example when there were wounded men who needed the place\nI'm worse there was also the ah in some of the rap groups they had some supplies and there was hoarding 'em ups supplies and and of water especially\nThat's what I was thinking as a hearing these stories even without\nIn fact they have the water supplies they're out there in exposed to the elements for days they they have no water and after ... days they're just going crazy and then\n[noise] [noise] [noise] from\nChevrolet Master control center this

[noise] it's just incredible feelings that I never will be full of just ... when I have the catheter and to know how long flight on\nUm and then one commander ... testified at the trial he said that he would have socked McVeigh whether he had been ... or not and then it didn't make a difference but\nHe was testifying and Japanese through a translator and the translator did not translate exactly what he said uh correctly and commander ... could understand enough English to know that but not enough to\nReally repair the damage and also he was you know in\nThis very intimidating environment and so I don't think it was really can conducive for him to sit there and argue either\nBut I'm In later interviews Sarah found out from his granddaughter that that was something he always regretted was that um he had been translated incorrectly and that had and that had in part had been kept in the day\nThat he was angry years later Sarah right at the with the retiring of the USS Indianapolis the submarine the namesake ship many years later a there was an attempt to get him to open up and share the story and he wanted nothing to do with it\nExactly you know they're a commander built or I'm Sorry captain built Tony who was the commanding officer of the Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was a he commissioned\nBill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to do was talking with him you know but he did what I was actually pretty incredible as he actually wrote a letter you know kind of flashing forward a few years to the exoneration effort ... wrote a letter\nExplaining his side of the story and saying that the captain should never have been found guilty and you know kind of did what he could do in order to help exonerate this man\nYou tell the story in the book about a Nineteen sixty reunion a to prove the survivors\nAnd captain McVeigh shows up and he's not exactly sure how he's going to be received by by the crew because you know he was court martialed um he received as you note in the book at these terrible letters from a family you didn't feel he'd been punished enough\nAnd um you know I'm\nReally guilt tripping him for years afterward so he shows up at this Nineteen sixty event and how is he received a limb\n[noise] he was received with open arms he have very much dreaded going to this reunion in Nineteen sixty he hadn't seen these men [noise] except for just a couple of them but most of these men he had not seen since Nineteen forty five right after the court marshal\nSo they decide to have a reunion and they have their reunion in the ships named safe city Indianapolis, Indiana\nAnd captain McVeigh was dreading it but when he got there they actually um travelled out a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the airport and they formed\nTo receiving lines are across the tarmac because they didn't have debt ways the way we do now they would they would just they were deep plane right onto the ramp\nAnd when captain McVeigh got to the bottom of the aircraft loading stairs someone shouted attention on deck and\nEverybody's snap to attention and then they began to cheer and the clapping and tears came to his eyes and he he couldn't believe that they were re feeding him so warmly and that continued through the entire reunion we can\nTalk a little bit about difficulty in getting materials you talked about going through archives and records to share with me you did you run into road blocks that you could not get past and and if so what were they\nActually one of the the documents that really helped us pay the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and\nYou know I tried for years Lynn had you know come into the picture and join me in this effort to get a copy of this document and the reason it was so important was that it was really the first recorded testimony of any of the survivors right after the sinking\nSo you know just days after their rescued there in the hospital in Guam and their testimonies are taken and so\nWe tried everything to get these documents and this actually this specific report and we would come back you know oh it's last forever oh one you know we got one copy of it and it was entirely redacted and you know freedom of freedom of Information Act\nShould've allowed us to have this and then you know we contacted the is the source again and our contact said well we don't have an on redacted version doesn't exist\nAnd so interestingly enough you know a friend or actually a young man who became a friend was the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and same fifty three men his\nHis grandson was actually um\nI'm an inspector general started trying to remember the title he's inspector general works with the navy and he was actually the person who got us this document and this kind of showed us really testimonies of what happened not only when the ship was torpedoed and those final moments but\nWhat was happening in the water because in the court marshal they did not allow any of the testimony about what took place in the actual water because they didn't know that would impact how McVeigh was viewed and so it was kept strictly to what took place one the ship was torpedoed\nAnd the events leading up to that so this new court of inquiry document was so important because you know Seventy years later stories can change your stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what really took place not only when the ship sank but in the water for those five nights and four days\nLynn you talk about the lights mediate after they were rescued what it was like for the survivors where they were taken um I I Would assume more of them died after because of their injuries and exposure\nWell if you did die and and if you can imagine how awful that\nWas not only for the men themselves for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue only to die in their exposure and their injuries um\nSo I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sarah yeah\nThree hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately survive because they were taken to base hospitals around the Philippine see eventually converging on Guam where they had um some\nTime to recover before they had to give their testimony and then they went aboard the USS homeland homeland ... which was\nAnd I ended in our home city of San Diego where they were actually participated in a parade and then a very quickly they went home a\nCop buses and trains back their hometown some of them ... got out of the navy some of them and survivors leave and then got out and then stayed and made careers in the navy [noise] um\nYou know this was the greatest generation so that that majority of them and they just kind of put this behind them they went on to have careers and engineers and fishermen and everything you can think of police officers\nThat there were no he could not hold a job and there were those who became alcoholic and um had many many struggles\nAnd almost to a man none of them talked about it and not even to their families um they held it in ... years and years and years and I'm I'm for sixty years\nUm but mostly they didn't talk about it today that would be a lot different I think people would be out trying to get a book deal or a movie deal or something like that but these men were different\nI think about that Robert ... character in jaws you know he kept that story bottled up he becomes a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys and I'm\nA as a very moving scene that that was great I was going to use that clip anyway I was really glad to see the coverage him in the book or or or did you always have in mind keeping that in there\n[noise] oh yeah it's really you know when Lyndon I've gone across the country talking to groups about the story in this book you know one of the\nThings that really comes out every time that that most people learned about this story from ... so it's an essential part of the stories history is that you know the public learned about it this way\nAnd interestingly enough some of the children of the survivors actually first heard about it and that their father was involved in it by watching jobs you know they came home\nSeveral accounts came home saw the movie or really impacted by it and especially this thin and only to find out their dad was on the ship the scene and about well so you know it's pretty incredible the men didn't talk about it that long but then to find out this way but that's you know how your dad served in World War two so\nWomen been since ... Indianapolis who's the book when we come back we'll open up the phone lines and maybe uh maybe you've got some questions or comments recalls we'll be right back\nTo be some\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier the some commander of Indianapolis\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and since there they found the ship\nAnd I didn't know what he was talking about it for in the morning of and so you know\nDating my faculty and you know realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before the ... group which was the vessel that we're slowly responsible for finding that ship ... there's been several attempts and they were the first one to be successful\nAnd what was interesting about it is they said you have three hours before we release this information to the press so go ahead and call the survivors so bill and I spent the next\nThree hours of calling the survivors up and being able to share with them the news that there should have been found so that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's the reaction in general\nIt was really I mean it was very somber was most of them couldn't believe it actually happened and then it happened in their lifetime I'm\n... [laughter] mostly reverence and then there was a young man by the name of a famine Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis in the day the ship sank hit a really good day playing dice with his buddies and so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money suck on winning [laughter]\nYou know across the board it was general you know respect and reverence for the story but you know there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt [noise]\nAnd and land you know we've heard a little bit about road blocks put up to the information they were they were not entirely helpful at every step of the way to get the story told what about reaction to the books him since come out from the navy\nBoy we've been very very gratified by the reaction there is\nAn admiral named Sam cop who is the director of naval history and heritage command\nAnd we make contact with admiral Koch at the survivors reunion and I believe it was funny pain or twenty sixteen and we and wild through we'd really like to have your support and your health on this\nAnd um he was helpful and directing as various resources but if you can imagine sending the real work at the heart that you've done to try to honor these men and\nAnd and gave the entire history and draw new analysis about various things that happen in the story you can imagine taking that and then sending it to the director of naval history and heritage and and saying hey sir hey admiral what do you think oh boy we were we nervous about that that\nHe really rarely has endorsed the story and and then says his full court since he saw which is what we came up with\nWell I Know Sarah has an award winning documentary film about it sure seems like it would make a great movie I'm a big screen movie any thoughts about that\nWe are actually working on that right now so stay tuned [laughter] we'll\nTake a couple of calls I've got some other questions but the west of the Rockies Jerry in ... California has a personal connection to this story Hi Gerry\nHow're you doing my father was a on the ship was the first one or the ... or to rescue the servers and the water and I'm Still have one car being used in the short from school\nAnd I never saw him I ... years past ... years go by never saw him cry\n... talk about that story\nThat's amazing what he uh with the on the USS that peace will take the oil or the path that you know the name of the ship that's a man\nWho ... and I don't remember it's on it's on it's been stone and I was just thinking about that before I call not yeah what was the name of the ship\nAnd to me she was the first one who knew him and he was talking to you was horrific you know he tried to tell the story a little bit and my father never talked about in the about Egypt all the you know all those years you know\nHe was like a you know just missed part of the ethos of that generation but those\nOh yeah yeah he was in World War two and Korea or he was going to drink donors may first class you know moving in regard and he was a police optional who's officer for Thirty years well there is an incredible story and all that\nSort of re heroic can go into harm's way like that and um if he was aboard the Basset\nOne interesting story is that the commanding officer of the bat that\nWas considered to be a coward by them as men and indeed when they arrived on this team he's it didn't really know what he was getting into and uh he knew that that had been found probably by submarine but they didn't know what exactly had happened\nAnd there was um a sailor who spotted a large shark and the water and he said look at that fish\nWell fish is another word for a torpedo and so the captain ...\nHe tried to get everybody out there and he said I'm all ahead full we're going to get outta here we're going to leave the scene and his officers actually need need and lock the captain in his state room and continued with the rescue so it'd be interesting if your dad this had been on that ship\nThanks Jerry appreciated wildcard line Ron used in the morning on\nMorning ah my father was also in the navy and he was on the destroyer escort Cecil Jay do while he was twenty six years old he was the end and Dr\nAnd what's interesting over forty years I had opened up one of his uh I guess to see just you know volunteers memory loss and I found unbelievable and eye witness accounts a letter of the uh\nThe point of view of the rescue of the survivors I've got the letter in front of me it's faded August fifth Sunday at sea\nAnd it's a phenomenal letter I think the women would love to see this to read this it talks about the sharks it talks about the fact that the pull these guys up kicking the sharks off the rear end\nShowing 'em up with the with a line given a morphine given him penicillin\nThis is an unbelievable letter from the view of the doctor and it was my dad\nAnd he has been at some of the reunions but never did talk about this is the fact that I found this letter it's about five six pages of the whole account its its history its historical I Love my fair share this with the\nYoung ladies if I can get them in an information and now\nI'll tell you what Ron why don't you hold on and on a A R R gal there will get the information for yet will pass it on to land and Sarah and a thank you for calling appreciate you sharing that I I'd like to see that by self thank you so how many how many of the survivors are still with us or Sarah\nThere's fourteen still living\nClass I don't assume that they still have a gatherings do they actually\nYou know um we've gone to several events all over the country with them and they they do have reunions every July and Indianapolis I'm\nAbout five or six I think six came this year and it is dwindling but you know we'll have an event on the USS Hornet on Veterans Day and two of the survivors will be there for that so you know the the youngest is Ninety One but\nStill sailors that heart and I think think an arm wrestle man when [laughter]\nYou know it's a generational thing well we're we're hearing these descriptions both from the two of you and from the caller is about um\nHow how these men reacted to it keeping bottled up inside you're right it would be different now people would be out there on Dr phil or or getting a book deal or something but keeping it inside I don't know if it's entirely healthy but it certainly has changed when you agree\nYes absolutely and I I Do wonder whether maybe even more healthier I I don't know I think ah I think that generation may have been a lot more stable than we are now but uh\nIt is an interesting contrast isn't it and then I think it has to do with the ...

blame it on the major\nI dealt with this and and I'm In a former life in a with a different disease but everyone who had the disease and die they said died from the disease\nWhen the reality is some of them died from the flus some of them died from Livonia some of them died from you know just being sick being old a cancer but no matter what they died from they said they died from the disease same thing with the measles\nIf you die for anything and you have the measles are going to say you die from the may just an easy diagnosed it's an easy way to get rid of your case um I've thought about

college educated white let me\nHold on hold on hand but you're not you're not local because you said you're ... where are you from no I I'm originally from Iowa okay I Know I Know I've lived here for a twenty year though you had lost their Midwestern accent though a ha [laughter]\nIt's interesting what part of what I'm I'm from South east Iowa little town called Mount Pleasant how far from the quad cities there I'm pretty close 'cause that's an eastern Iowa right yeah oh yeah right now maybe hour and a half an hour you got you go ahead\nSo I Am a college educated white women are hand I don't understand my own demographic Everytime I hear that I'm like what you were talking about a few minutes ago\nI'm truly mystified how anybody could um the Democrat these days as crazy as they are and I'm starting to think college educated maybe just been brainwashed\n[noise] let me break it down for you [noise] differently [noise] let me put it in a different demographic and tell me if it makes more sense to you and I hope everyone is listening 'cause I'm not going to do this frequently because it could be perceived as sexist and it's not\n[noise] what if I told you that they didn't used to\nDo white women with college degrees that wasn't the demographic they use to choose when they broke these things down they would say married or single\n\nAnd white women with college degrees are more likely to be single than white women without college degrees who are overwhelmingly supporting the Republican ticket what would that tell you about why your demographic is voting the way it is\n[noise] um well it would tell me a little because um when I was younger and single I'm I was definitely a much more left leaning like why are the kinds of during two\nReasons why you give me both of\nWell I think one thing lack of life experience um honestly I think um I think it's just in my case it matter of getting older watching how my taxes were going um I'm also I did twenty seven years in the military so I've always had that perspective\nWhat is I think what what is one of the single women afraid of being stuck with\nA low paying job\nNo baby oh a baby they don't get stuck with a baby they they don't use words like a burden when they get pregnant right yeah yeah the other thing that they're afraid of being stuck with it is\nAn inability to provide for themselves over time you know human condition is what it is but I'm I'm not trying to offend anybody when I say this [noise] but when God created man and woman they looked at manager is not good for men to be alone the corollary to that was not good for women to be alone either\nThat's what he ... and and so but but the men can at least grab a gun and go out into the woods and kill the Baron dragging home and all that the woman\nNeeds I mean and I think deep down in the human condition\nThere's a need to make sure somebody can do that if they can't yeah and and and I think that when you look at white women with a college degree or single white women that's what you're seeing and that number that's why that number has historically lean Democrat\nOr it's not because Trump has a ... it's not because\nBy various parts of their bodies that's not what it's about\nThat number has always been left leaning and numbers always been left leaning in fact I'll say this if you take women voters out of the equation there hasn't been a Democrat elected since Franklin Roosevelt that meant a Democrat elected since Franklin Roosevelt women have made the difference in every single election that's gone

sister um and I just wonder you know I I took down there for the book there at all the the insurance as you can get for their\nOwn really\nCatastrophic insurance I mean it's like you've got opposed to seven thousand dollars to go before it pays a damn\nYou know unless you have Medicare Medicaid if you're just trying to get on the Affordable CARE Act ... why I'm a law makers especially cause some that\nThat that was the goal of the Affordable CARE Act it and it is largely being accomplished or the goal of the Affordable CARE Act was to make a ... ironically healthcare so unattainable so expensive\nTo make sure that they completely bankrupted the insurance companies and made everybody did test and despise private health care that was the goal to be affordable haircut a Affordable Care act it was actually a multi step\nProcess step one was getting Medicaid or Medicare into existence you had to get Medicare and existence to take care of those folks once you had Medicare people who say oh when you're old\nYour medical care's free you don't have to pay for it at all and all that kind of nice I Can't wait till I get old and have free medical care\nStep too was making sure the poor people were taking care of Medicaid\nSo that they said oh well if you're old\nThen you get free medical and if you're poor or you get free medical care that's nice step three was to make sure nobody can afford private health care at all and that there was nobody around that would be willing to\nTo ah to write private health coverage and that's what you're seeing the last few years since the Affordable CARE Act which went into a which went into effect in twenty ten twenty Eighteen\nAnd it's basically worthless I mean you know the lot of lot of policies that you get on the Affordable CARE Act now the Trump Administration has tried to slow that down a little bit by saying that you know\nHigher ... believe it or not because the idea of the form of carrying cruise to take a healthy people young people middle class people and subsidize everybody else\nSo if you're if you're twenty five twenty six twenty eight years old you've never had cancer you never really had any trouble you don't go to the doctor Yemen doctor maybe four or five years what the hell do you want to pay three hundred dollars a month for\nFor health insurance is truth right but but if they if they make you pay what is your feeling about health insurance you hate it right right yeah because it's I mean three hundred bucks a month now that might be a week's work where you work at twenty five years old who knows\nAnd and that's that was the goal that the goal is to make sure you hated health insurance you couldn't afford it it didn't really cover anything it was worthless anyway then stepped full or is that every one clamoring for what the old and the poor have\nThe old and the poor because you couldn't have been clamoring for free health care uh back when health care didn't cost that much and was pretty responsive to what you needed right so in the fifties and sixties\nHealthcare didn't cost a lot it wasn't terribly expensive or it was pretty responsive to what you needed you showed up every now and then when you needed something and other than that you sort of tested out you don't get the sniffles you test it out you got a sore throat stuffed it out you got the flu you tough it out or you didn't run to the doctor all the time you didn't uh you know a lot of people look at health insurance\nIs imagine if we did car insurance like we do health insurance that you or your oil changes were paid for and\nYour tires were rotating imbalance were paid for the new show up in some tire service company you know time sitting on a motor service or run out there and change oil run out there

I think he would do more damage to them by attacking Hillary than anything else so let's continue wound the uh the others and that too oh which is kind of interesting but then there's some that are young I I think watch out for that young person\nOr your avatar maybe that need to find as well right well that's right and and I think are the problems when you see Cory Booker for example with his ... he comes off us\nLead the party unite the party and go toe to toe with President Trump that's that's what those are the test and you can't imagine any of those people Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York Elizabeth Warren ...\nCan you imagine them one on one with President Trump and the debate for the presidency it's just hard to imagine that they are all don't look like life wage compared to the president job I can count yeah people like him and they always like him but they never vote for him\nI mean he gets basically one percent when he runs he's going to be Seventy eight I think are so something like that or become a come the next inauguration he's very old a Bernie Sanders very old I think Clinton and Trump are not young but they're not too old yet\nAlong the lines of people like it but nobody would but it's true it is I mean he wouldn't ... whenever he got into primary she just couldn't do it\nYou know he's very likeable but people just kind of ...

listening to you know if you tuned to to\nLearn how to spell the name there\nYeah what are the odds are that one happening [noise]\nNot too good\nOkay so we have the a cofounder of real clear politics he's going to be talking about the um [noise] and they to understand he's got a kind of a fact based version opinion based proposal here that I had some information that backs up some of the things he say\nOverriding surging to forty seven percent the highest she added this presidency that according to a new Wall Street journal NBC poll that same poll found Republicans are in the lead on a general congressional ballot in the sixty nine battleground districts so what does this mean as we enter the final weeks of the race\nThis is going on here first on the comparing the interest in the mid term elections to choose from two thousand two thousand fourteen look at the\nDifference surging interest across all demographics um you know now interest doesn't translate into votes necessarily but it certainly seems like the electorate on both sides across the spectrum Israeli prime for for November six this year\nDo you say that's because they care or is that because the party has done a better job contacting them\nThat's a good question I don't know I mean I I think part of it is\nThere's just no escaping politics in our everyday lives now I mean so everybody is it feels like they're they're tuned and they're locked in what's going on in a way that they haven't necessarily in the past and that's partly the Trump effect I mean he's in he's driving the news every day whether you love them or don't you can't get away from um therefore I think uh he he is a strong reactions on both sides and I think that's what we're seeing in these numbers\nAnd let me get back some of the step up that he's saying and we've always used a number of sixteen hundred sixty nine\nDistrict congressional districts out there that are kind of the the kids in other words they are the ones that\nA Democrat has the ability to win Republican as a bow to to lose about ... the window only five basic a Democrat says that a Republican could could pull up but when you look at the sixty nine what happens is\nIf you're a voter and you're walking in and you of answered the generic ballot in question that you're going to vote Republican then the odds are that you're going to go carry that through and you're going to vote and pick up that congressional say even though you don't know who the member of Congress is\nAnd and those sixty nine\nThat's where you have this tightness when you look at the generic bouncing question you including the entire United States that's including for example San Francisco when the big\nOld city urban district center there that are very very strong Democrat so it's an unfair\nUm comparison to do that you don't really care what's going on in San Francisco you don't care was going on in New York fourteen the one where the socialist just when you don't care about those which you care about sixty nine\nDistricts that the generic bone in question is as in there you basically find it at part\nThe next thing that sort of taking over as how good is your candidate\nAnd it is your candidate will lie well organized and to do they have a good message\nFor example the one that is in Michigan is kind of messing up he is an incumbent Republican and he's gonna messing up and he's probably going to get bounce because he's not winning a good campaign and the his opponent as much younger\nAnd is appealing to a ... a wider group that's probably going to be the difference of that rights\nBut it's interesting listening to this is that if we kinda clock to this these things have really close and there may be a kind of a surprise and all of it I can see where the republic the Democrats can take twelve sees easily I can see it Fifteen\nIf if the wind's blowing pretty well see that\nBut I think also you're going to have some Republicans pick up some Democrats say so it's going to surprise the papal\nBubble Comstock has said which everybody's kind of pointing to that will be a bellwether I'll be looking for a on election night she's in Virginia will say that fairly early will say the buffalo a New York where the guy who was indicted is when will see those early\nAnd both of those are wins out there then that's that's going to start showing a good sign for\nThe Republican same thing in North Carolina and South Carolina some of these contested seats but\nAnd but I think you're going to be surprised who Republicans are actually gonna pick up some ... so let's go to the second part of this mid term sixty nine key districts\nThink we're seeing that too but a lot of people think big turnout is big for Democrats to still believe that it's\nNot necessarily no I mean in fact it it depends on the district is depends on the state I mean if it's a if it's a Republican leaning district\nOr Republican leaning state big turnout will be probably good for Republican so I think it's a district by district thing um overall and again each one of these races matters if you have a lot of Democrats they turned out very blue districts that's not going to help Democrats are suddenly swing districts ah or any of these red states\nI figure the monitor there I was I Love this poll it was kinda buried and the results here in the wall Street Journal the congressional preference in the most competitive districts in the country but is it is a virtual a dead\nHeat yeah so the national numbers of plus nine Democrats which is which is a strong number and that would actually correlate to them taking over the house but that's what caught my eye in these competitive districts\nThey're generic ballot lead has disappeared and what that suggests is that Democrats are over performing as I just mentioned in very blue districts very blue state um but not as much in some of these more competitive districts and that's\nThat's a good sign for Republicans I think just two weeks before the election again I you know I always caution people let's not make too much of any one single pool but we have seen some of these similar trends and other polls especially in President Trump's job approval rating\nDo you still say health care is the number one issue the economy's number to immigration and the top five how would you rank\nIt yeah that's what we're saying I mean health care is definitely seems to be in all these races everybody's talking about what's on the Florida governor's race last night the debate um but the economy is there and that was the other thing from the from the wall Street Journal poll ... Republicans have the best reading on the economy that they've ever had in the history of that poll\nAlso or don't Trump our nose at its highest in his approval job approval rating that he's ever had and this woman NBC Wall Street Journal boat whose own any three but one that most show will be back after this\n\n\nDannemora show\nIn ...\nAnd and\nThen he\nComes when I knew when\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nChevrolet Master control center says is W.

negotiate employ and there's no in order to do some pretty clear on this she thinks nuclear weapons which are produced the nuclear weapons tore apart but his line is as long as they don't come to their senses will have more than anybody else\nWere bigger and better type thing but\nAh before we kind of get into the rich get the networks talking about um the Saudi a situation and do major Garrett here and are interesting pieces from a Rand Paul can be coming up\nSaudi Arabia is official explanation of the death of Washington Post contributor Jamal ... has failed to end the allegations of a cover up Saudi officials say king Solomon and the crown prince have called ... son to offer condolences\nPresident Trump spoke with Turkey's president on the phone yesterday and agreed the case needs to be cleared up\nAnd you're guaranteed that the White House\nPresident Trump appears willing to believe the Saudis ... they say it was not murder that the crown prince to facto leader of the kingdom knew nothing about it and that the Saudis\nCan be trusted to conduct a credible investigation even though they've had to admit under intense international pressure that this death to showcase came at their hands will kill us allies in Europe and keep voices in Congress say the Saudis story doesn't at all\nI Do I mean it's again it's early\nPresident Trump said he believed to Saudi Arabia is evolving story that Washington Post columnist and us resident your mom could show geek died after a fight broke out inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nWe haven't finished reviews or investigation I think it's a very important first step\nAnd after nearly three weeks the Saudis have not said workers show ... body is nobody seems to know somebody knows Mr Trump also said no U.S intelligence agency has heard an audio recording or read a transcript purportedly of cars show geese violent deaths we've heard about it but nobody said\nOkay so\nDon't don't they take that part of what he said I Believe and then you go back and look at what age as soon as a second ago and he's he's not saying that ... to come back to more major Garrett and the story but red top right after the [noise]\nYour news talk\nPlace to the band Morris shows on news taught in Ninety three point one W ACT has\n\nSome you know you don't want them to respond to\nYeah and uh unfortunately they just did it on all on the America as taxpayers back\nSo um that's something we're going to have to deal with for a long damn time uh I Hope they resolve this because this is dangerous and these these lady of rice that the long run for bad enough but they medium range or more diverse because they're more tempting to use on a smaller level what you say\nWhether the tactical weapon do you do totally and I'm a mortar round center nuclear that's ... that's probably the most disturbing but it is a heck of a better to do that in a you know five hundred million tone bomb going somewhere\nWhile both against the war is that these intermediate are easier to ship to other countries or a different groups get their hands on ... and you don't need the expertise to say shoot off an ICBM right in which we can do is you can fire does the Caribbean ...\nAnd then we just have more nuclear items out there for people to mess with they get hold of it and tear as where it's just ...\nYeah I mean I'm thinking about the neutron bombing things in them and the vet nowadays it's a lot different than it was in the Nineteen eighties\nOh yeah because technology is a hundred times more powerful than it was at some things are a hundred times smaller and harder to detect while they're playing with fire above skews me they're playing with a fusion\nHow was it was just fired a hell of a lot more dangerous to the bar at the lower Rio thank you very much guys I'll be less nominees here what doctors aren't than in some of these other and War College folks thinks about the situation\nThat experience I appreciate you backing you Tony Tony ... made you hear is going to be talking about when it's impossible or he's gonna be asked about what is impossible us actions that can happen because of the uh\nYou're the president promised to bury severe consequences what what exactly at the White House considering\nA key working relationship with Congress is beginning to emerge and the president's talking about that with a bit more specificity there's an underlying law\nThat requires sanctions to those responsible for carrying out a human rights violation of this kind but there's no sense here John the president's going to tamper with an existing arms deal with the Saudis are fundamentally altered his height us relationship with the kingdom\nAnd made to the president's son in law Jared Kushner has a tight relationship with the crown prince how does that affect the calculus\nThat relationship was forged during the transition John when\nNBS the crown prince reached out to Jared cush there president elect Trump empowered culture to develop a close working relationship with the Saudis as a counterweight to Iran the United states and the Saudis have been very close on arms deals Yemen other issues in the region and Jared Kushner has relied heavily on the crown prince to forward that\nTrump agenda in the region and now has to explain if that close relationship in some way gave the Saudis the sense that they could go much farther than the u._s. do this but it's ration was comfortable with and the show the matter\nIt by the way it is a blower this in the background a set of noxious sound that happens [noise]\nI'm suited for the same kind of turn a little bit particularly when you hear Rand Paul and some of these others that are going to be talking about those\n... and I'm an isolating Rand Paul here because I think it's an important kind of give a different perspective of things and Rand Paul when it gets down to international issues is different Lindsey Graham or listening to him talking about the crown prince\nSenator let's start with your reaction to the Saudi account that cut a shell game was killed by accident enough testified at the consulate and that the Saudi rented rented a heck of a thing to do with it do you believe the Saudi ...\nPerhaps slowly not I think it's in ... it's insulting to anyone who's in analyzing this was any kind of intelligent background to think that over a fist fight led to a December met with a bow and saw so no\nBut I think we should put this this brazen attack as brazen murder in contacts with Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has basically over the decades in\nThe largest state sponsor of radical Islam and violent jihad they sponsor thousands of them a draw says that teach hatred of Christians and Jews and Hindus around the world so this isn't the first instance this is just another on the line of long distance of Saudi insults to the civilized world I\nI'm going to get to the larger relationship and among them but I Want to stay with this case at this point what do you think was the involvement of the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... on a decaying has absolve them and then five to put ... down in charge of the overhaul of Saudi intelligence\nI think it's a stretch his credulity to believe that the crown prince wasn't involved in this and I think that's the way they're going to write this off and people in Saudi Arabia ought to be aware of when you're told what to do go into it and\nThen they'll execute chewing and put all the blame on someone else there is no way Fifteen people were sent from Saudi Arabia to turkey to kill and does it end without the approval of a crowd and friends and that's why I say we have to be stronger than just saying oh we're going to sanction a few of these people and for ten like we're doing something I think\nReally need to discontinue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia and how long a serious discussion about\nWhether or not they want to be an ally or they want to be an enemy\nNo ... or like yeah he's a he's doing pretty good on that um\nSo now he's going to be talking about the ... and believing in the store you know you know okay so what do we tell them okay we've gotten a fist fight and we killed him and then we jumped him up well wasn't actually a ...\nThere you go then we had to do what I'm doing we couldn't just on the body so he took his clothes off we put this goes on another guy gonna look\nOr did you hear the ah the um the ... you know try to do that and then we\nGot him to pieces because you know\nThat's what we do right which sanitary\nOkay so it was gonna be talking about the birds soon British and believe in this story\nWhile you're saying we've got to get tougher about President Trump was asked about the arrest of Eighteen people involved in that case ... and ... of firing of five officials some of them would have close ties to the prom French here's what he I decide\nI think it's a good first step but it's a big step a lot of people you know a lot of people involved and I think it's a great first step to Israel either but I Do I Do\nDoes President Trump and do something that you don't senator or frankly do you think he's covering the ...\nI think the Saudis are an authoritarian government\nThey they are directly from the top down and you don't have the will just going off and doing things on their own and I feel certain that the crown prince who was involved and then he directed this and that's why I think we cannot continue to have relations with him\nAnd so I think he's going to have to be replaced frankly but I think that sanctions don't go far enough I think we need to look at the arms sale because this is not just about this journalist being killed it's about the war in Yemen where tens of thousands of civilians are being killed\nIt gets about them spreading hatred of Christians and Jews and Hindus throughout the world I mean thousands and thousands of madrassas teaching radical violence against the west the Saudis have not acted as our friend and they need to change their behavior\nI I understand I understand that but I'm asking you directly about the president's reaction he says he finds credible an account that you find incredible why do you think he's doing that\nI don't know or the raising our cat answer for you know the president's thought process on this I can only say that I think many of us are looking at their situation saying that this could happen in an authoritarian government without the crown prince being involved\nIn Saturday's the two winners are tearing government were a

horrible than those don't need to happen\nBut have the the the the two best fighters on your team with Dana and Jack Lemmon specialize in representing men and that is especially important when it comes to issues like custody were prejudices against men still exist in the system\nTheir number is eight one nine for eight one zero a one line for a one zero the to the most amazing women that I've

yeah that's what I Know there there are being is real idiots from the global is for the left for George Soros whoever and I think the idea is like anything anything they can\nDo that they think will hurt Trump they'll do and this is just another weapon in their arsenal of ideas which are pretty lame actually to um you heard this president\nTook the words out of my mouth because you know what's gonna happen when he sends it spends troops down there they got they got the media is going to focus in on the babies and the women yeah yeah yeah so Boston's along and they have yeah that's exactly what the point I was going to Mike but I Love your show brother you have a good day okay good\nI have my wild [noise]\nEverything is worse catastrophe in the world but after a while it just\nGets old

weaken rapidly bring security into those families lives and that is really exciting to me\nAnd we're going to pay for that how Mr Bulger how's it going to happen and what about the people that\nI mean there's plenty of people who don't have wealth and may never been on food stamps are required government assistance who would love to have fifty thousand dollars to what about them how you're going to

Alabama's courts a place where the rule of law was respected pen not where the mob rules for by Tom Parker for chief justice mock celebrity twenty to Montgomery three snakes one one once\nSex abuse stories have dominated the news for the past six weeks beginning with winds steam predators in Hollywood the media and politics have been exposed and they had been punished and that is good news because justice is always good news and will continue to bring it updates on those stories as we get them when we sure we will\nBut going forward we should also be careful that the noble effort to end the sexual harassment does not degenerate into a witch hunt it can happen\nAs the Washington Post just proved so with that in mind two things to remember first anonymous accusations always lead to abuses the right to face your accuser is the cornerstone of justice and has been since ancient Rome\nThat's why it's enshrined in the sixth amendment to the constitution is why we band star chambers we don't allow people to accuse others of armed robbery or murder from behind the shield of anonymity why did media outlets allow it in cases of sexual harassment if you're going to name the accused you ought to name the accuser assuming it's an adult\nNews organizations are not courts they shouldn't take aside when guilt and innocence are in dispute it's too easy to get it wrong and they often do\nSecond not everyone accused of a sex offense is guilty not every accuser is telling the truth I learned this the hard way a number of years ago when I was accused of felony rape by a woman I literally never even seen\nChoose a certified public a town in Indiana and upstanding member of our community and also apparently delusional her claims were protest but they were highly specific the

yet none of that none of it was true\nI spent the next two months trying to stay out of jail I couldn't tell my children because I knew they'd be ashamed I couldn't tell my employer because I knew I'd be fired immediately I spoke only to lawyers and I paid them a fortune I took a polygraph exam from the former head political for the FBI I\nNever stopped worrying that the charges will become public industry in my life everyone accused of a sex offenses and something on everybody knows that and I knew that no one would believe otherwise\nThis isn't a defense of sexual harassment or misbehavior obviously it's just a reminder that real life is complicated more complicated than surmise on Twitter sometimes the mob is wrong\nSometimes the innocent crushed that's always a tragedy no matter what the charges\nOf course partially in the innocent may also be the point of the exercise and we're seeing that\nLast week a feminist called Emily Lyndon announced on Twitter that she was quote not at all concerned about innocent men losing their jobs in the search for perpetrators of sexual harassment quote if some innocent men's reputations have to take a hit in the process of undoing the patriarchy that is a price I'm absolutely willing to pay\nThe price she's willing to pay she's not paying it\nBut that's kind of thinking it's out there man it's a pretty scary if you asked me just

for a while yeah it's not bad either right um no it's just but I mean I Would if I have one I Would be scared I Would be excited but I also be like oh no\nNo there's him mature young man now has all the power in the world\nI'm probably call my father\nThen I Would go I Know a guy\nI Would call Brad McDonald financial planner graft and I would probably call around for a tax attorney\nWould

then I Would tell my parents and I would\nThen be like okay when this happens\nPaying off the mortgage you need anything else right\nAnd then that's and then I Would be like OK and now I'm just not going to tell anybody go wouldn't tell people not crazy how people end up like these people that win lotteries and stuff how they end up losing every\nGas all these parasites\nLike trying to suck off and do you feel bad\nBecause you're like I wanted by luck so it doesn't feel like you really earned it ends yours you're very generous it's interesting how generous an egalitarian people to come when they're giving away money that actually they didn't produce\nAmazing\nTrue amazing how that works but if you actually produce that built the wealth up you're still philanthropic they're still out there but yeah especially if you do like the whole Bill Gates were out\nI mean and people like while you were Bezos gives up money or Bill Gates ... don't get is incredibly generous people will still nit pick them for oh that's that's like me given two hundred dollars like\nOkay we will\nBut if I'm the president of United States or I'm a senator right now we're going to do at another arms deal though you don't get to train in our facilities anymore we're not helping you and supporting you to go in and attack Yemen\nYou're going to piss off the military industrial complex\nOh yeah I'm gonna piss off and I'm going to piss on it with ... wrestling entertainment\nNo I mean as a senator but good for you because not enough people are are doing that and at least in the United states hey maybe let's not let's not talk about this arms deal yet let's see how this investigation plays out there's investigations sham since the beginning and that's why Turkey's playing the song odds like for\nAnd I see exactly what Trump in ... or doing though it's it's a whole big plan we can't what one person getting away with it and like the expression of values because it's not like we're actually upholding values are ever have we've been partners the Saudis for nearly a century yeah\nThis is hard nosed geopolitics and people get ground up and that and so what Trump's on ... this whole team early ...\nWe we had the Saudis working better with Israel we have everybody kind of plan together against Iran\nAnd that's the whole narrative we want to push and now they do this and Turkey's lawn stirring it up were years ago turkey never would have done this this guy would have been killed it doesn't get out into the press ...\nTurkey is now a wild card and they're not a good wildcard they're\nAll they're wild aired on is again not a fan of western values in many regards ton anymore and he's very much has a needle Ottoman aspirations I Would agree loved to be kind of the crown jewel of the new Arab empire because that's\nThat's that part of the world if you look at most of the history it's ruled by some center that is a very iron fisted imperial power yeah weather permits stumble or that's well that's interesting weather from assemble or Tehran\nOr essentially from Persia or turkey\nAnd ... Mohammed and the Muslims too so it's like which one will rule\nI don't know that\nIt's a big gay ... it seems like there's no good side\nRight especially now for the United states' rights so politically my knee jerk is\nYou don't get any more you know what I mean you get weapons of you and the Russians Chinese want to come in here and play the stupid game and that's part of the world\nGood luck guys it's a stupid game to play mhm we don't need your oil anymore we produce more than us at ... he might be able to up the price but that will hurt your market share and hurt our economy is even more so good luck with that\nYou don't get any more weapons we're not going to try to pick sides anymore I suppose we're going to defend Israel though they can defend themselves pretty damn well at this point and it's like peace we're out but I'll go back to why would say I would keep the wrestling deal\nSo because I think the number one way you do get that part of the world the change is culture is by opening people's eyes up but they've they on just what Saudi Arabia and the rulers want you to thing\nAnd you said the iron fist of propaganda video in there during the call to prayer\nThe show the outside world the propaganda videos okay but prayed\nSo ... so why have that all white had have that I'll put it this way\nWhen a Saudi kid and it was interesting blast Saudi Arabian of at the front rows\nAre these like Bosch couches it was the royals and they weren't into it at all or like some stupid American thing we bought but the kids you know in the back in the major part of the ... to the sixty thousand people actually showed up and there are few royal kids that were really into it as well up in the front rows\nTo see\nThose Saudi kids chanting the same chance at UC American Kids chair knowing it was a good guys are the bad guys are\nUnderstanding that that those stories and it's more than just wrestling is my point and the more we can beam in American entertainment more can be an American music and culture it will change that part of the world for the better it's kind of the whole idea of ... and\nThe Russians have a lot of nukes the Soviet Union has a lot of neutral we've got Pepsi and Radio Free Europe we got rock and roll and that's why it's like if you all want to okay\nYou all think you're going to pay a so we do a little propaganda for you if you're actually reforming your society great I'll say that\nI'll say that for millions of dollars that you're trying to reform your economy and your social structure mhm sure but at the same time I'm also going to maybe sneak in a commentary there about freedom of fighting\nFor it I'm baby steps to crushing ... yes so all for culture being shared all for it yeah great point and not for weapons being shared and you\nKnow the difference is you have all these businesses there's that sucked the summit that they were going to have\nThese businesses are pulling out the difference between that wrestling is wrestling is you know in the entertainment based on his business so you can't really follow what the other other businesses are doing and and you can't pull out of a summit because you're hosting events\nAnd also wrestling a big knock against them doing it is that your they're not allowing the women to wrestle and Saudi Arabia will bolster the women are getting a whole all women's pay per view\nConvict pretty fucking awesome actually do think that was a compromise not in a way it's more way to tell people to shut up we've got an all women's pay per view but I think that something they wanted to do anyway it was definitely man but\nThe wrestling awesome these days it's not just eye candy it's not TNA it's I mean some of the women are downright very hot was they can actually wrestled in third wrestling show called ...\nThere was yeah was it about the no ... no that is stupid like\nSix sided rain and they were kind of like if you have to see on the yeah the word and some of the W W E guys fell out of favor with the WWE they would go there to a lesser promotion where some of the WCW guys after that failed Kevin Na ... staying in a few other guys would go to TNA\nKen so I I don't know I I think what would happen to those who say you show you get than obviously these people in Saudi Arabia fans they're not just paper and the whole stadium\nLike they're actually people in Saudi Arabia wants to pay their money to go see the wrestlers go see John Sina\nAre those Saudi Saudi Arabian so what do you mean or are they Saudi base I mean there's there's\nEssentially two classes of people in Saudi Arabia and this is regardless of being the royal family or not although the raw family does fall into one particular class\nThat is the people that have Saudi Iranian nationality but going get educated in the west ... and then there's the people that don't and those I stay there yeah\nIt's probably a mix of both um I mean it was\nIt was the propaganda videos seemed like propaganda videos is like during the Solomon has been so sweet and go to us and so accommodating was like Thanks Paul of AK thanks triple age whatever\nBut the what ... I'm open my eyes was when John scene that comes out when undertaker comes out when Rousseff comes out like Bruce that's a new thing and to hear that whole crowd going and he's from Bulgaria\nAnd the here this whole crowd a Saudi Arabian kids going Rousseff day where it was that day in the same as an American audience would maybe go oh\nIt was an eye opening moment you'd think that's a whole other weird part of the world and it is but there's still people than they liked the same stuff yeah\nYeah so it's a way I that's why I liked the sharing of\nThe culture and you know that kid who's a fan of scene on Rousseff and under tigers gonna try to find more wrestling and he's going to come across as scantily clad ladies were also in power and is there going\nThe more we can have more satellites whether it's high culture in fine arts or in the market in the mud side show wrestling rings and pornography more the better beaming that into Saudi Arabia\nI think it makes the world a better place it okay yes not perfect but it it it it's a baby step it takes that iron fist away a little bit it gives people hunger for what other people\nAnd that is true but it also allows them to close that fist even greater Mm let's see your point\nLike look at this look at the west of the stations hate the west this is why you should have the west\nHave this program called DNA sir that was a a different program the naming something else entirely [laughter] but back to ... I'm sure your super tired of talking about this huh\nI'm happy to talk about the Saudis have lied every step of the way\nAnd the Turks are in lower all\nNow my favorite part about this whole thing is the Turks being like yeah we have audio and video of it\nAnd the sons being like but our cameras didn't work that day and it was like no kidding they didn't work that day you don't take your console console is bogged like are you a dumb [laughter] there's drone footage now of the day after the Turks have drones\n\nMainframe mania Walter or solve station\nSo they want to see\nThe print sales bag were they had what it takes you to live your life your prime life their services it's sunny as the forecast and their fee free checking accounts can chase away the collapse prime south back with locations of jealousy we don't get an Montgomery member FDIC\nHey have you heard about what's happening at Wayne creek casino and hotel\nBut I've heard it's the coolest casino and hotel ever from now if you joined when frequent why\nDon't reimburse the what's ... up\nDollar give me back as much as I found the dollars I Know right they call it the new plan from it and they'll throwing some free food so we don't go very well when\nMembers only move Seventy five dollar most requiring a comparably rules\nOr this is bogus and from the good some group how to sell your home and the shortest period of time remember the five peas prepare your home to sell\nPaintings of the interior exterior cleaning homes thoroughly have a professional cleaner landscaping painting the front door repair any items that you put a present the home buyers like clean homes be able to show the home with a short notice allow buyers time to see the home with their realtor alone so they can ask questions\nPromote your home through open houses Facebook linked in Web pages military size real dot com and Zillow pay for part of the closing costs this local market demands a certain part of closing costs to be paid by the seller provide a one year warranty for the bar this is great for the bar and\nThose out they won't be calling you about a repair for the details are marketing plan called the good some group at five five blonde zero two to five or email me directly a bogus thing that charter dot net that's five five one zero two to five\n... oh hey honey you forget a towel again\nThanks for the Arctic Chill I told you the way to start the dishwasher this is becoming ridiculous planning what we can and can't do it because\nIt might run out of hot water you know I've been hearing a lot about the tank less water heaters back from down the street just got one from Headley plumbing and she loves it with five kids she hasn't run out of hot water one making grab showers and she can do laundry and run the dishwasher without fear the faucet blasting cold water on them\nSounds too good to be true and if it is true I'm guessing Beth and Dan had a shot of fortune for that thing hardly\nThere are rebates available it's fuel efficient in Costa ...
