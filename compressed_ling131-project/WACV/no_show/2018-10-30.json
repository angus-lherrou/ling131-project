and financial freedom of choice yeah you know ...\nWhat does that happen main well you know what ... what else it was that in the future is where we're going to spend the rest of our lives ... exactly and you know if you if you owe work and put put something away for a rainy day\nThat day comes it's raining and you're you're sitting pretty you know you you've you've allowed for that you've you've

ability to make president choices that allow you to enjoy life and hip you stay on track to meet your future financial go there you go that's what it's all about ... yeah\nAnd uh I I have clients who come and they say may because they have concerns about how they are going to have income and how they can to actually last as long as they do right and a according to the Hamilton product\nA project which is something that you can check on roughly half\nOf all non retired American adults mhm expect to have a\nLot less money to live comfortably in in the in retirement that's only half\nThat's not enough uh the Hampton project also reports that this has been a consistent theme says two thousand and five that's not good that I speculate that this is an issue because baby boomers are that I've been speaking to her or quickly quickly becoming a\nApproaching retirement age in the stock market is becoming very very unstable and even the ones that have said they\nWeb at retirement with our news

is\n[noise] citizens [noise]\nLike the rest of the welcome back to health and well it is a\nA R you know we're we're talking about your will be\nAnd if you look over in the well when you see a being in there it would be it will be it would be a being in a way and yet you don't see that much anymore because if they fail kind of died at during the last person but at least they're not ... well yeah they they yeah that was a strange man and I wanted to ask\nHim how he has a fix for hats yeah well the first segment we talk about how I Believe financial wellbeing his best\nIs based on your personal situation and preference you know ... and the importance of having a financial plan to help provide you the comfort that you want in retirement mhm so there's a handful of ways to fill your need for retirement income that's really what are your ideas the income\nSocial Security is one of the way fry or it may not play an important role in some Americans retirement plans and he is\nA you know to know how to properly managed in maximize those benefits\nSo Social Security may be your foundation of income planning and it may not be it depends on and we hope it's not because of it is you're depending upon the government\nAnd it's just difficult to talk about retirement planning without also talking about it though so when you retire you're working income ceases but your need for income does not see\nYou know because you're still breathing and eating walking\nAround and use hopefully are failing well as a bean yes so when you retire you're working incomes faces\nA you need to replace that old salary you need to replace that old income and sometimes I just poses a severe challenges for retirement planning best for the challenges coming right and if you are one of those unlucky you\nThey might get caught or should I say more than a few\nThat might get caught in the next downturn and you're about to retire I guess what happened ... you may not get to retire when you wanted to retire somebody the other day and they said you know I Know this guy and this last go round was last turn down that happened yeah he said\nHe was about ready to retire\nAnd I think he was talking talking about two thousand one turned down yeah and he said just as he was about to retire\nAt in stable unstable market mhm had too much red money and ah it caught on fire and burned up and ah what happened was he had to work another three to five years and he said you know how long he lived after he retired\nOne year and then that\nOver the he had no more wellbeing he couldn't get over the devastation that happened to him because he was thinking I'm going to retire to a thousand and one and it didn't happen he he he did not get to do what he wanted to do it changed his\nPerspective on live it changed his plans on retirement ... so you've got to make sure that if there's any short falls\nIn if they exist how are you going to make up the difference the first difference is\nIf you don't lose your money you don't have to worry about making up for shortfalls if you had enough to start with us that maybe they just you know if you lose fifty percent of your money do you know you had to make one hundred percent to get back to where you were\nYou know how long it takes the stock market to make one hundred percent in a normal timeframe that's a long time\nI have no idea what's going to happen just take my word for it it's a long time it could be a longer time the new ...\nUh could survive so is very important that your balanced portfolio you down as where your investments are your balance where your Social Security lies in your balance to where you would be if something bad happens to the economy\nNow for you young folks out there it doesn't really matter as much you need to be aggressive as you can be\nBecause you're a youngster you're young story and you can make lots of money lots of income can be built off of that over time but when you get in your fifty plus years\nAnd you've already been saving for a few years you need to start it's like you're driving down the road you see a big wall out there in front of you are a big change on the road and you say man I think I better start slowing down that road it looks like it's got a\nRough place for a big curved down there is a curve they're going to throw curve at me down there and there's a warning sign comes up and says there's a curb ahead\nYou don't just step on the petals and start going wild crazy toward that thing do you slow down and you kind of look around and see what's going on around you and so the for the folks that go to fast round curves what happened to have the ... I have a terrible accident site turned upside down and they had heard over\nThe portfolio falls out and so in other words short fall may exist between the amount of money you have\nIn the ... the amount of money that you need you know and in some cases filling that income gap is is very important especially if there's not enough Social Security or enough\nDollars to fill in so understanding your Social Security understanding your portfolio understanding the curves in life and have to go\nAround those curves and the portfolio stay stable maybe that portfolio sitting in the back seat and you won't turn over fall out or go you know I had a friend the other day he\nHe lost his cell phone mhm I said what happened he says you're not going to believe this I had my cell phone set their own my dash yeah\nAnd my window was down and I'll go and I went around the curve and my ... you are not going to believe this I tried to catch it but he flew out the window and somebody ran over\nWho I said you got your phone crushed because you had your windows down and you went around the curve too fast you weren't being careful he said I hate to tell you it was a dumb thing to do if I had had the window or\nOr if I had been less violent when I turned that care about when the last phone he said it took me all day long to get a new phone and it it makes\nAnd flown that's exactly what it was it was a Sam's Hong Kong and then flowing\nRun out the window is long and they don't have any more songs and somebody ran over it and it says flag is a pancake man man it so if you don't want your portfolio to turn those through the window flying in flight as a pancake make sure you got your windows rolled up make sure your portfolio was tight\nMake sure there's no way in contaminating bowl of that stuff out make sure your balance make sure your tires are balanced on your vehicle make treat tires are balanced on your portfolio so they will go where it needs to go and you know we're using all these parodies all these allergies\nBut your car if you're a race car driver yeah and you're young\nThat's fine you can get up on the tracking him run that thing wide open because you've got the knowledge and the power and the time to do it yeah but as you get older you don't see many Ninety year old people flying around on top of a big curve of oh they're out all up in the interstate [laughter]\nThere's a time for everything that time the the problem is that a lot of people don't want to come out of that high year mhm when when you're when you're about fifty years or it depends on the person\nYou need to start looking at slowing down putting the gears that you know like when he's coming off of the big ... you kind of use the gears these big trucks use these big ears to kind of protect yourself from getting too fast and turning over\nYou know and they have these birds Elaine's they can run in a ... a brown Tennessee obscene words\nIf they ... they're called runaway truck lines oh yeah you know if you get run if you get a run on if you're running away if the stock market started running away you run out you you can jump off of it and run up that thing and you say your portfolio you say your truck you save you load mhm but when you lose you load\nYou can't get it back all over the road Dahl over the road so you got to be careful that you don't lose your low you gotta have it they skate calls you got to have an ex Cape lane\nYou've got to make sure that everything is balanced you know these trucks wonder running real fast\nYou ever seen these the police got pulled over the state troopers got above the chicken the white right sometimes it got too much on there sometimes they they wouldn't balance dried\nAre sometimes you see I'm only in the interstates and they're they're they're upside down or something happened to them and because they load shifted in boom they they're off the road mhm you don't want you to load the shift\nYou got to be balanced properly it's it's important to your well being\nExcuse me of the synagogue that suffered so greatly let's listen to you welcome the president to Pittsburgh in\nOf this I Do not welcome the president's him I said hey why not because he's the purveyor of hate speech\nHypocritical I'm worried that comes on him um tell me nothing\nWe have a we have very very strong leadership and the city is leaving values not just ... leaving values and I was there not the values emphasized that ads and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh or the current\nEvent that you know ... forgive me for saying this but I said it is in June the Jews are out to lunch on this these issues that first of all Donald Trump was the first one to be attacked\n... uh you know is a counter punch it basically and he doesn't spew hate for any group nothing like I mean I turned on MSNBC the other day a ... in the cold well is that the panel\nEvery single there were four people on the panel was the Trump and said I\nAm a nationalist and every single one of them linked that adults Hitler why because they were in every one of them said nationalist is dictator\nWell I actually know a Joseph minutes see any of the nineteenth century figure who created the modern state of Italy he's the one of the coin nationalism is a Democrat\nThey just won't find any pretext to link Trump to Hitler a Lawrence O'Donnell on CNBC he said when Trump said he was a national it said we all know the word that goes with nationalist it's white\nAnd then that translates into Hitler\nThey have against Trump dwarfs anything that you could say that Trump Trump Trump is kind of actually funny and as a tax 'em an ally ... light hearted and everybody understands what he's doing a but these people they have done themselves into a whole here\nAnd they they continue to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time since Abraham Lincoln that the Democratic party or any major party\nAs a gone to war against the legitimate ... elected president assistance which is what Schumer and Pelosi called layer of campaign of obstruction is not a legitimate function in a democracy\nFor political party we have a system of compromise we have a system where there is a peaceful transition of power and you wait for the next election\nAnd that translates normally into a honeymoon the Gallup estimates is about seven months Trump didn't get seven seconds there were boycotting is inauguration there were calling for his impeachment\nThe hate is coming from people like this rabbi who insist\nOn demonizing president United States which is something it hurts all Americans he is our commander in chief and you know they did that the Bush too they called Bush Hitler the Democratic party is out of control and off the rails\nAnd a ... you know I think as time goes on more people are going to realize that\nUntil a ... there are some silver Democrats but there and intimidated by the party left now um but that they will come out of the closet\nJeffrey nice to have one and islanders for with now is aptly Jeffrey Maier yeah Jeffrey Myers says the current rabbi who of course is just\nAnd ... to his people his worshipers and he was asked the same question on CNN Today in responded like this rabbi I'm President Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue in the aftermath of this do you want him to come\nThe president of the United states is always welcome 'em some citizen he's my president is certainly welcome\nA good answer you know every time I go I go to a synagogue I look around ... hopefully that there's a security guard there [noise]\nBecause universities are teaching to hatred they they ... and our university the curriculum\nAnd the middle eastern studies programs but generally is that you know the Jews stole land the Arab land which isn't to genocide ally\nThe land which Israel was created belong to the Turks for four hundred years previously the Turks have not Arabs and they see the dilemma too because they were on the losing side of the first World War uh\nIt just you know there's this than a Seventy year aggression against is to destroy the state of Israel and yet if you go on a college campus today the sympathies are all with the terrorists\nKnow pro pro Palestinian uh the Jews are\nThe aggressors and on line today and saying the same thing that that this was caused by ah both the president's rhetoric and those Jews and the United states who are are helping support him and and continue to give him cover which I'm reading this stuff going\nThis is this is a literally insane I I I have no words to this\nNo exactly this is the best president or from the point of view of of a tourist survival up we've ever had\nA Trump you know no problem with it in some ways his kids are Orthodox Jews for crying out here it's just insanity and are\nThese so called liberal Jews um are contributing a problem or have for the Jews\nBy the army and they're always attacking me I don't know I've done a lot of demonstrations on college campuses against students for justice in Palestine and I'm a NASA much to the Jewish left for that reason and it's

does for for\nAndrew because I think folks will ah who may not otherwise want to vote if they see Obama's for Andrew they're going to want to support me I'm particularly given his record on things like the Iran deal\nCozying up to the Castro regime being very weak or when it comes to the misery ... regime and Venezuela so I welcome President Obama how I should be paying for his travel expenses that come down\nAnd don't forget you know we have the president or the United states coming down on October thirty first ah to Fort Myers in southwest Florida and then likely come again before the

down to Florida for me\nWe'll give them as a silver tongue and order I mean it's putting it nicely I'm trying to build a nice today I'm about about our by political opponents but he's he's kind of homes bond kind of throws throws off the rhetoric times today he tries to do the whole thing that Obama does\nI don't think he doesn't do it nearly as well but this is what part of what he said last debate with you for our listeners let's listen\nTo my grandmother used to say I have a dog will holler\n\nMisses the census has spoken a first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this day he has spoken at races conferences not calling this a dissent is the races I'm simply saying the races believe he's a racist\nAnd of course they are ... are lovely\nIs over and MSNBC et cetera said oh that was such a brilliant line but we discovered today a there is a painting or Breitbart today that of course these boy Connors of Israel the anti Israeli organizations supporting Gillum the ... and you know he's not sign this\nPledge called dream defenders hum I planted my support to the freedom papers and the freedom papers are of course I'm also advocate textbook socialist principles the virtue of being born each of us is the absolute right to adequate food shelter et cetera\nUh and it goes on and on and of course I'm anti Israeli groups supporting Gillum honey respond [noise]\nOh yeah like I mean I thought that that that performance\nBy helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous um and he keeps going back to that because I think the cupboard is bearer on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody who's just on representative of Florida values\nAndrew is the one who is aligned themselves with dream defenders they are openly antagonistic to Israel they support boycott by best and sanction of the state of Israel they actually organize boy or\nA flash mob protest in Israel they have special trips or just the target Israel on and so what we're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of the gods strip and so he's way out of step on that\nUm and I would never accept an endorsement from a group or the boycotted Israel I Would never endorse them from the debate stage like he did\nUm you know it just a couple of months ago and that group also says horrible things about law enforcement they say law enforcement is racist they say the police and prisons have no place injustice um and that law enforcement should be defined it so that's what he said\nI'm In terms of the pledge he signed um and I think that that is just way outside of what is acceptable in the state of Florida and I don't think he's ever successfully answer those questions\nOr another piece out in the Tampa Bay times just a few days ago new Andrew Gillum documents\nFundraising dinner and of course that the FBI agent as part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption and turns out\nYou know four thousand bucks worth of food and drinks but want to kill him fundraisers a was paid for by this individual posing as a Florida real estate developer\nCalled us right so he said just last Sunday when we did the CNN debate\nWhen I was confronted him about all this oh I'm a grown man I pay for everything how dare you all this stuff well then it turns out just a couple of days later there was a text message is showing he acknowledged that its price the thousand dollar ticket to go see Hamilton\nWas actually paid for by an undercover FBI agent who eat dog with a with a local real estate developer\nAnd then it comes out just a couple of days ago but that same undercover FBI agent posing a developer under road almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner\nFor Guillain nation governor campaigned and indeed Andrew did not\nDisclose that expenditure and so he didn't even comply with for the law so he goes around saying that he's not been investigators and being investigated but I Would ask the question\nWhat other reason what an undercover agent have for Greece in his palm with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting up quite a fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating will not be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he'd been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nWith fleas or politics but I only went down to some really simple in these last closing days as sleazy this is sleazy politics as usual bribes uh people people dangling little benefits and politician jump\nAnd they just jump okay what do you need what do you need a ... ... ... oh yeah oh yeah I'd love to have that sure it doesn't matter if it's a Hamilton ticket or a\nTrip or restaurants it's sleazy corrupt politics at Tallahassee sadly\nHas has become known for and if if if people want San Francisco in in Florida than definitely vote for Andrew Gillum okay if you think San Francisco has become one of the most poorly run cities in the United states then you better get out there and vote for on Santa's I endorsed Ron\nOver a year ago because I saw his leadership and his vision for the state of Florida and it's unparalleled it's unparalleled so don't mistake the smooth talking Obama wannabe Gillum for good leadership it's not\nIt is it's pathetic and by the way a Ron before we let you go I got to get your take on this caravan I heard the Scarborough absurd today if you're if you're concerned about the caravan you're basically anti Semitic I mean you've got you know diagram that sends a but the but it looks like Floridians and the poll that just came out\nCouple of days ago CBS Hugo poll shows that only I'm only twenty six percent\nSaid that immigration from Mexico in Latin America has made life and the state better\nThirty eight percent said no impact thirty six percent said it's made life force in forty three percent said the migrants would ultimately pose a threat to the United states\nAh thirty eight percent no threat that's an overall a poll there but now fifty one percent of Floridians pulled said we should not try to help the migrants and the caravan\nForty nine percent said we should try to help us kind of a ridiculous question I mean we don't want anything to happen to these people we just don't want him to come to the United states that's a loaded question but your view on they care about\nAll this is one where you cannot allow people to just illegally run across\nOur border the fact of the matter is Mexico offered them a place to stay in Mexico they declined it so it's not like they're just trying to move away from difficult circumstance or the nearest refuge\nYou think they have a right over on our border I think that's wrong Andrew Gillum a support the caravan coming into the United states as running mate was out there saying yesterday\nThat we need to welcome in the Caribbean and in the United states um it's a you couldn't have a more stark difference um for borders Andrew stroke and borders I Want to support our men and women and he wants to abolish ice\nWell again this is a this is an issue that I think the American people are following very closely I'm Andrew Gillum actually speaking now in Miami and I'm sure we'll a pulse them down there a Kamala Harris stumping with him right now so they they see this race a congressman\nAs absolutely critical for not just the state of Florida now but for twenty twenty and so all their big guns are coming down there so the president's coming for you you had pants

interesting article this week in the federalist federalist dot com the federalist dot com if you want to look up the article the article says the research proves the number one social justice

separation how long have you been married\nI'm about twenty two years oh my goodness\nIt must be bad it it just that we are are just not on the same\nPage anymore um and uh what other things but um with money as well and it's just um it's just a something I just I don't want to go on land\n... have you guys been sitting in a marriage counselor\nOr that he's not willing to\nHave you gone yeah OK please do that for you even if he won't go on and I think it will give you good\nI'm emotional information twenty two years is a long time and you need to have somebody walk with you who's not in the fog if you go through this and or give you some and maybe maybe give you some information to give him a little bit of a wake up call as well but back to your original question\nI have a friend of mine that teaches divorce recovery recovery after a divorce and um I remember many years ago hearing her say divorced turns on marriage into a business transaction\nAnd so it it comes as a real quickly the emotions are carved dolphins set over to one side and the actual technical legal financial details are on the other side and it becomes very transactional kind of thing at that point is that makes sense\nYeah for that and so a here here's a couple of things to look at your student loans or your student loans that are going to go with you unless you know you may or may not get alimony child support or something else but your student loans are going to go with you um and you're gonna have to pay them so what is your personal income\nUh it took out\nOkay All right and so what you start doing is if this is a a direction that you know after seeing a counselor and doing everything he can to save a twenty two year investment uh him with all the help you can get a you start preparing for living on your own for fifty thousand bucks a year\nAnd you'd look at your student loan so much to learn that if you got\nAbout ... I'm Sorry sixty thousand oh my lord okay [noise] oil\nWould let them know that this was going on hardship for all until you get past ah what else whatever else is going on here okay now do you own a home\nYeah what's it worth\nA two hundred thousand or what's out on it a hundred and Seventy thousand okay so now I Would either the amount to anything or\nIs your car paid for yeah as his car by for now okay is your name on that loan no good okay are there any credit cards that have both of your names on them\nAnd there is the one that I hear she met him I'm Sorry\nYou refuse to let him use it a better than that glass closed that account today\nJust completely closed the credit card\nIf he has the number he can use it if he's one of the users on the car [noise] period and if things go sideways emotionally inside your house I have run into situations in Thirty years of doing this where somebody takes Mexico drip and puts it on the guard\nAnd you don't want to pay for\nOn this card so close the account today just completely shut it down to zero\nBalance good close okay ... does your checking account have both names on it now okay so your money and separated by march is there any other debt or dead instrument that's open that has both of your names on it\nYeah yeah\nOkay I wouldn't accept her mortgage probably as both their names on it okay so here's what happens you can't afford to keep the south you can't stay there you know I'm so the house that needs to either be refinanced to get your name off of the mortgage or sold\nYou cannot stay on the mortgage and give him the house that would be dumb\nAnd people often do that in a divorce they often do that\nBut just you know the negotiation is the cars in his name he keeps his car your cars and your name you keep your car your checking account or already separated there's no other debt you get your student loan debt [noise] um it does\nHe have any big savings or investments or do you and for one case\nAnd not big now how much\nAm I Am I Am a ten thousand or one K. and I'm not sure what he had um but I'm thinking about five or six thousand not much at all okay as far as well as his income [noise] ah it's around Ninety thousand\nOkay in most states your attorney would have to advise you but in most states you'd be do some alimony after twenty two years\nAnd that was going with your fifty thousand is how you will reset your life and stay out of debt and start working your way through these student loans that are outrageous and are going to take cues from time to work through\n'em but you're going to be working extra job you're going to be doing everything else taking any any money you can squeeze out of your budget and you are not going to Mexico you got a mess on your hands [laughter]\nOkay [noise] no I'm not\nSo um unless it's to escape no just kidding [laughter] ah but the ... so you know you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans are going to get the cheapest department you can get it going to stay dead free and address these student loans as soon as you can get to stabilize the\nAfter the separation which will lead to divorce unless it leads to you all getting back together\nOkay about pro care for separation the same way financially you would prepare for a divorce and that puts you in a position of strength\nTo negotiate in the divorce financially um and that's something that you'll have to do and your attorney and you get representation and you'd be ready to pay them pile up money for deposits and for paying them don't pay extra on the student loans until you get the other side of this and I just put 'em on ... and pay nothing right now\nLet's get the other side of the past but but my hope is is that you guys you can see a counselor who can give you some words to say some tools to get by by wakeup call maybe the two of you sit down with a coach or counselor and walk you through turning the corner on all of this before you get so far around the corner we can get you back\nAnd may be you can save this thing I that would be best for everybody involved I'm\nAssuming the issues that you have that are causing you such concerns are addressed and I'm sure that I'm sounded like a pretty long list but um I said I don't address ... see a counselor for your sake call your pastor say who can I sit down with can walk me through 'em\nIn the right questions to ask myself the right questions to ask him um because he may think you're kidding uh he may think you're bluffing\nAnd when you actually move out it may it may win\nBut those kinds of things are best guided by a really good marriage counselor that's really experienced in wise and a\nGodly council or or help you in that situation I sure hope you guys can turn that around that would be my hope for you it'd be better for all of you are financially as well as everything else so good question thank you for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight\nTo five five two to five you jump and we'll talk about your life and your money [noise] interesting data that just came out on the article I read on the air about marriage\nAnd um men who are married and make more on average

taking my call sure man what's up in your were\nWell my wife and I really sat down and realize that we're on a bad road for future and decided to really take control of our finances in it live and just going to keep going get him in some you know we recently earned them online and had a friend who just that we watch some of your guys videos and [noise]\nAnd you're on line there from there and so you know you step into the right now we are currently saving for ... to one\nAnd we have a total ... her loan and consumer credit card that of Seventeen thousand nine hundred dollars [noise]\nUm my question is I'm including in the Seventeen I went ahead and ruled in our second mortgage that we purchased on the home we just moved into a total of two thousand one hundred and Seventy five dollars\nGo in my mind um from what I've learned in ... so you're not working that's on calling it was should I rule in the second mortgage the reason why I think that is because that's been lower um\nOur bills won't pay that off\nTo your your second mortgage it'll two thousand dollars a\nYear or so my wife and I just recently got into her second how\nYou know okay so we have a clue one they'd be able to two thousand dollar second mortgage yes it's part of your debt snowball and baby step to\nOkay good I was just curious I wasn't sure if that would be the best way to continue to attack is to have you lived here for a week or two daughters\nYeah if it's if it's under half your annual income\nOn a second mortgage we always suggest you put it in your debt snowball an man that's an unbelievably small ones so thank you and graduations well done and I mean just knock it out and I'm I'm Glad you're attacking this what's going to work for you Debbie is with us in Anchorage, Alaska Hi Debbie welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nUm I had a question about whether it would be wise and maybe that shot again we're back to refinance our house to pay a credit card and I'm not\nA void of bankruptcy how much credit card debt if you've got thirty four thousand okay and what your household income\n[noise] a hundred and forty\nIn some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible\nAppreciation and incredible market activity in both of those markets you should so so you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing and you should be able to do the same in San Diego\nAnd I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um\nI'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes or I Would either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not going to I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of been spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and non retirement [noise] um or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable\nIn order to have a house like that with having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now if you re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash\nA non retirement cash and money from this other home\nAnd it goes up to seven hundred when your salad you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market\nThere's not any more expensive markets for you to move to in the military\nThan San Diego that's about to tell us I mean Hawaii oh why you may be okay but uh there there's a couple of other main there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper than San Diego I think we all agree to that\nSo if you make some money and you're there are three years\nAnd you sell out you're going to put money back in on retirement investing in by a less expensive home may be a larger home but less expensive home the next by in the next station does that make sense [noise] just sort of the so it's not really a permanent decision even if you use all your non\nRetirement cash although I'm with you I don't think I'd want to use it all I'd probably try to buy something\nIn the for hundreds instead of in the five hundreds leaving me with some cash\nAnd non non retirement investing a but the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all being in one house and I don't like it all and I don't like so much of it being um I don't like using up all my non retirement investing from a portfolio standpoint my answer to that is is not for that long\nYou're not going to be there ten years\nAnd if you are that that makes us going to change during that ten years um but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real estate agent expense of real estate in the next next location that your station\nI thank you for serving your country sounds like you're doing a good analysis on it I'm just kind of joining you in the discussion Jason is with us in Tucson, Arizona Hi Jason how are you\nKnow how you doing better than I deserve what's up\nUh I I own my own business and I'm trying to figure out how not to be climbing under or when I'm ... years old a ... a retired and they should I go or oh okay well you know I started a retirement like that\nOr do you ... well the first thing we teach folks to do is to get out of debt and\nEmergency fund before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payment you are more money freed up to put into retirement and then we want you to put five Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement Jason what do you make a year\nAh it down around a lot of average probably right about uh\nOkay and how old are you\nI'm thirty four and okay good do you have any debt no good for you are you single\nNo okay does your wife workouts are on the idea that marriage what does she makes a roundabout fattened it okay All right so you got about a hundred and twenty thousand dollar household income and no doubt it\nAnd you're thirty four years old well done well we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that grandma's rainy day fund and then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent of your household income\nInto retirement and that's going to be about Eighteen thousand dollars a year in your case going into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has a thorough three or four one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office you would put some money there especially if there's a match\nAnd then you both need to do a Roth IRA you can do five thousand five hundred each that's eleven thousand dollars I'll be Eighteen that we need to be putting in right there\nAnd put that in good growth stock mutual funds and Jason to help you set that up and teach you how it works just because you need to learn how it works you don't do it because I said do it or someone else or do you do it because you understand it and you don't buy something you don't understand when it comes to investing\nThat I recommend good growth stocks mutual funds for your long term

but Donald income comes up ... do you what what was the hardest part of this pretty well 'cause six hundred a few\nUm oh go ahead and I think for me the hardest part was I'm starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see the hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper\nTo undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um so I think when we paid off our first student loan um that was just such a victory feeling for us um so it was really hard at the beginning to go from letting our money kinda flow out wherever\nTo really narrowing down a budget and doing the envelope system and that was hard for me to the you\nKnow I think for me it's just the the sacrifice um you know in the world we live in just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around you spend money and buying mood nice things and I'm just constantly telling ourselves that will be later you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of what you always say but it really\nHas been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can look like no one else in a really close to that because there were times where we wanted to give up or they would have been easy to just you know do by what we wanted\nTo be here now to be able to talk to and all these people and just say that we did it it's just an amazing feeling so\nTherefore you know those are the ... the last three hundred pounds\nAnd I was pretty incredible ... well I Know it was a long time and a lot of sacrifices are worth it is or is that it was where you go back and\nNo no no no we've never had credit cards we want to cash flow um we're in baby steps for well at the beginning that the baby step for but we're wanting to save up to cash flow from an event you know not say that but\nYou know during the world leader in changes you're going for a good good for you guys like well congratulations to her more church leaders

Scott welcome to the Ramsey show\nThank you for taking my call but it'll be on your tips are what's up you know well a recently got married a couple of years ago um we're looking I'm trying to figure out whether or not to pay down my house\nAnd uh some equity that would give to me when I purchased my home that I'm actually a kind of paying my father back 'cause I purchased a home from my father um the interest rate that I'm getting on the mortgage [noise]\nUh so where we've I've I've been on the program for about two years ah everything's paid off and we I worked for the government my wife's a teacher [noise] uh so we're already putting uh about ten to Fifteen Percent of our income into our ah for myself\nUm I actually am a I went to the government version of a financial case university [noise]\nUm so where are you talking about the tea us aid I have my job my wife has a ... three B. I'm funny thing is is I'm actually one of the uh coordinators for\nFor for that okay so you're working on those four or five and six you got your return rumor going your debt free you have your emergency phone in place and you have a house that you live in and you have a I guess for rental house as a second and I was one of you used to live in is that correct\nCorrect and as the other house rented\nIt's her her brother is living there um he's living there by himself he's paying us a alternately after the mortgage and the uh association fees and the taxes are paid and we're actually losing about a hundred and thirty six dollars a month on the house\nAnd why are you are subsidizing her brother while it's not that we're subsidizing him um\nUltimately I Would just rather it is at least this was the mindset was that I Would rather have him there and uh we get some tax benefit from the house so I assume that the hundred and thirty six dollars amongst that we're losing our actually getting back at the end of the year to at least break even or maybe still make some money on on the home\nAnd stay home and break even I'm All right so you you've got this is that her house or your house like it but it's person says her brother living there correct okay if you didn't own that house she wouldn't go buy that house and called tax benefits and subsidizing brother a good plan\n\nYeah we're actually I'm sitting down in the house she bought it for two ten Kelly worth about one Seventy one eighty\nHow are you better\nThan I deserve how can I help\nYou had a question and I hadn't seen are graduated a year early and I ate here on my parents made because of the scholarship opportunity I Do not know how to support myself while going the nursing school because nursing school is such a time oriented program\nUh-huh okay a\nShower you know I'm Sorry ... show you how old\nAm than anything you've told me that I'm showing now and you stayed there because of a scholarship there to nursing school star it's ah it's through the state I graduated here and my parents knew because the job opportunity because so the scholarship is partial\nYes sir how much of a scholarship that you're good at twenty thousand every four years there wasn't a large one twenty over four years and it's a four year program I take a fair trial and what does it costs it costs a dollar a yearly okay which you have five\nKids are so we need eight Yes sir plus you need to eat [laughter]\nThere is that detail right where are you living with friends family what\nI'm living with friends we bought a house out in the country because it's cheaper you\nAnd some friends were roommates yes our current and so you have rent and electricity your career and you have food and you need to get out and you need eight thousand dollars a year\nOr\nSo when we add all of that up what does your rent and other stuff cost you a month\nIt cost me about nine hundred thousand depending on my guy and ah I work minimum wage and I do things like clean and people how they and things like that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nMhm current right so let's let's add that up then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that and I need a thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other are probably some books and some stuff too but we're pretty close their show twenty thousand dollars a year is what you need to earn\nIt there and minimum wage doesn't do that sounds like you to another job [noise] and I have an opportunity to start a whole ailing family name brand clothing and now I don't have the money to put up right now no they don't need to get into that you have\nA job you need a job you need to so you can make more you can make a Fifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and managing\nYou can make good\nMoney cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour ten dollars an hour cleaning houses I'm walking dogs or other stuff so I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage\nAnd by the way you make enough to work your way through with a number that you and I are discussing here I'm In um you are going to be working all the time though\nAnd and if you but if you can get a situation like that the semi self employed when you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever [noise] um and you\nUh\nAnd money you can control when you work and how much you work now you are going to struggle\nBecause you're going to work and study and go to class and that's all you're going to do what you can make it if you do that\nThe other thing I Would do is I Would apply for a bunch of scholarships the third thing I Would do is investigating some of the hospital companies that are out there\nParticularly in your immediate area talk to the nursing school and see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school how much of the nursing they would pick up for you okay kinda been indentured servants type program if you've ever heard of those\nAnd I married a hospital that actually planning on working at and they will find games all my mind about like ... and her body\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now and let them just pay for it now\nOkay rather than have to pay you back for student loans because I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with the math were you in are doing here\nSo I Want you to apply for a hundred more scholarships you'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps us situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you couldn't control the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with this hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but\nYou you sound like you are to me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old I sounds to me like you're a rock star thinking and so I don't think you need to play beer pong his real\nHot [laughter]\nI I think you don't mind working and and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out of this with you know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars of student loan debt you don't need to\nBut you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this and the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable and your tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career\nIn terms of employment you will be able to get employed instantaneously\nI'm I'm a nursing is just there's always a shortage\nSo you're going to do very very well but I Would go talk to that go talk to that hospital administrator at the local hospital just set up an appointment with them and just walk in there like you own the place there's a kind of like you can do that\nAnd uh just tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work there how's that work\nAnd how can you help me get through school because I don't want a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a statistic and you know get get him impressed with you and and let him help you be a hero in your story and a him or her that hospital administrator\nWho by the white needs nurses so they're going to be very intentioned\nAre very very inclined towards helping someone in your position especially someone who walks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on and um you know get get some people on your side helping you accomplish this um\nThis task that's in front of you but you're on your way you're doing really good congratulations very proud to talk to you call me back if you need help as you're fighting through this Greg is with us in Milwaukee Hi Greg how are you\nDave thank you for taking my call how are you today better than I deserve what's up [noise] well I just have um a question for you I'm On a layover are fully all and get your opinion on a couple of things here um\nAnd all of our house um we do at least our cars and um [noise] we do that um I have a customer and that and a good kind of mine that I reciprocate or money that they spend like me back with them so it's kind of a win win situation um purple hair\nThe main question that I have is we have um [noise] I'm not invest bench I'm over a hundred thousand dollars with\n'em too off IRAs and some mutual funds and that type of thing uh she has four one K. I. up a four one K. actually it's a pension I'm as well and right now we are paying above and beyond our mortgage I'm On our house by about\nTen to twenty percent and and putting that toward the house with the amount of and that's been ... that we have diversified compared to what we're putting into our houses is that the right formula\nWe tell folks but Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement once you're dead free except the house and have your emergency fund and above Fifteen Percent of your income and going into retirement and your debt free except your emergency fund but then I Will put everything above that towards the house to house paid off\nTook your income sounds point one five [noise] make sure the total of all the Roth IRA Asian four one\nK. contribution you're doing is essentially that are greater than that is greater than that in fact some of the contributions down a little bit to throw the balance of our service not up to that let's get it up to that as the balance\nHouse and\nThen we suggest she was a visual forms of\nBroken income aggressive growth and international\n\nAsked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where\nYou are and your baby steps it's a necessity\nNot a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace a stay at home parent responsibilities I only recommend term life insurance since is the most affordable way to get the right amount of coverage and not break your budget go to ...\nAnd uh yeah I'm a I'm not on campus anymore fifty five it was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but ... you know you got past that stage now your back is that okay yeah cool thanks for dropping by things open phones at triple\nEight eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia I glare how are you\nI'm good how are you know good how can I help\nUm I have a question for you and we all your data set for a little less than a year now and I feel like we are I'm a bit ahead on retirement but we're behind on college savings for two kids\nShow how old are your kids and they are twelve and ten okay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement I'm a little more of our million roll your head congratulations ... so what's your household income\nAs an only child that way but yeah we we are I mean when you have more than a million dollars you're a millionaire yeah okay yeah you're right [laughter] [laughter] yeah so ... what is your household income a little over two hundred okay\nSo why can you say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get plenty of money for college when you've got to years before college\nWell we're paying for private school right now as well\nWhat are you paying for brown to how much cash how much ... than a year per kid or total total okay you make two fifty when looking at you like a hundred two hundred I mean one eighty okay\nAnd if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's who that cash flow can return towards casual in college too if they choose a college it's a reasonably expensive\nYeah OK okay that's a good point I yes right so\nI you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement\nYou don't need it here in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the moral\nBut I don't think your house to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids to school today we're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college we want to invest and set aside and put Fifteen Percent on his\nSide so we're talking about thirty thousand dollars that's fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say something to college you say ten grand a year per kid another twenty grand you can do that\nA front for from now until they go to school don't have plenty of money I mean you just Jack up a five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control and saw that five twenty nine get or the one that's more of us are pros and they'll help you\nOr area the people we recommend them sit down when you help people that are between on together and pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you are not working our plan at this stage\n... Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby step seven to increase returned right beyond Fifteen Percent and Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand started ground\nSo that that's how I'm doing the math here I think you can do it I think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it\nAnd instead of having an actual game plan will lay out and go this is important this is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing so that we can do this and that's ten grand a year per kid for college to kids that's point granted that's where I mean you've got is where you are so\nGood questions thanks for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Donald's on Twitter at Dave Ramsey\nAt Dave Ramsey I guess what you're saying where does buying a home falling the baby steps after baby steps three\nYour debt free\nYou have an emergency fond of three to six months of expenses and you have your down payment above that they're not move into a home broken in debt Sallie Mae will need her own bedroom you do not need to buy Sallie Mae her bedroom\nThey're not buying a home when you're broken into the home will be a curse I Want the home to be a blessing\nAnd when you do things right it's a blessing\nWhen you do things on the order and you get in a hurry because\nEverybody used to house and price of gas masks and beer inter God\nShe says what broke people say\nThey buy a house on the world and you don't want to houses when you're broke and my broker broker and broke her while they call a mortgage slowly your\nAll knew that the ... ... ... actually a bias is is that I Ramsey\n\n\nIs\n\nUsually in East Asian\nLeg folks let's talk about finding a ride home for your family the amount of new homes built continues to trim aboard year after year\nWhile those can be a great option it's not that simple you're just not picking up paint colors on an open floor plan there are many potential pitfalls you could run into if the processors and our approach with expertise in gosh I'm\nThe builder has an agent representing their best interest not necessarily yours but this is why it's crucial to have a real estate professional guiding you through the process who's on your team\nOur endorsed local providers are in the top ten percent of agents in their area who know how to spot a quality builder or E.

things in from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum world\nSo by studying quantum mechanics and how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've come up with a model\nOr is it how I I fit in what what I understand to be going on\nAnd tell them they tell us what that model might be\nWell the idea is that a\n... okay I'll I'll I'll look at it this way so I ... in the morning I take these I call them a a meditative walks so so when I'm walking\nMy one way of looking at me and said I'm I'm a a a a a particle being I Am a bean physical being\nBut if you see that I'm I'm moving and if you look at like in in in fast motion or whatever I Would be like a blur so I'm really I'm a I'm a wave more than I Am a a a a particle being\nAnd I and my my location is is not just in one place so I kind of see that in the in the quantum world that's that's what it is everything is in wave form and we don't see the world that way because you know that some in the subatomic world\nBut if you take it up to the macroscopic world than you think about that ah that\nI I'm not in any one location and then and and that's kind of how how I see it and and I think that that helps me understand how how this works and\nThe ... the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and when I called forks and the road of time I talk about that in the book\nWhere are we experienced a it may be a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those\nAnd in one dimension I think is where it comes into you know a different dimensions\nI think that we we might die in that particular thing that that incident and another's we we live on is if that didn't happen uh and and sometimes we have knowledge of what the incident might have been or maybe sometimes we don't\nAnd uh and then we can have many of these forks and the road of times throughout our our our lives and keep going from one life to the next\n... but at the same time that we're doing that there's this spiritual part of us so there's actually two part there's a physical form and then there's the spiritual form or that that is eternal and that's where I come up with the uh the title of the book which is timeless that that we don't really ever\nDie\nAnd in time is you have documented thirty four ... cases that happened to you have there been more you just didn't put them all in the book\nAh [laughter] there there's a lot more and I have\nTime list Asia booth and uh I have twenty eight more experiences and I I I I kind of wanted to test the waters with the first book I said I saved some of the more well I'll just say a little bit more bizarre stuff for the second book based on the reaction of the first one\nWhile we'll sounds like we're going to have your back about the same time next year\nAnd I and I yeah I plan to release it about you know the late summer early fall and and then I I also have a third book plan too so I I there's a lot of the incidents the they keep happening\nI I was going to ask you how deja vu because and we'll save a lot of it for the next book\nBut ah you had mentioned the experiences where you know you may have died in one life but not and another do you think that sometimes we might have memory of other existence is in other parallel universes and that's why we have deja vu [noise]\nI I I Believe so in fact uh I I remember as a as a kid and this is interesting because I think\nChildren are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but third ... that's kind of over the years it's kind of a through our education system or sometimes maybe by their parents are different\nOrganizations it's kind of a you know drained out of them but I remember as a kid thinking I Wonder if I have already died and I'm somebody else now I think I Am and it's and and I don't necessarily remember a previous life experience from that but I I remember thinking that a lot I mean a lot\nAnd uh so I I I think that's interesting that the children have those those are those kinds of feelings but I'll give you an incident that happened just recently with me and my son we were driving here in Southern California on a sub surface streets and I\nI look down just momentarily I don't know what it was something that dropped onto the floor of my truck or whatever and I looked up and\nWhen I looked up and I thought it was just a split second Harry was hurdling through a red light oh and it was it was terrible\nAnd and how will the son [noise]\nHe's he's Eighteen okay and he's sitting in the in the passenger seat and freaking out yeah he he is and we're going through the intersection and on either side of us is a car you know two cars coming right at us so what was going to happen that I can see was that we were going to get T bone from both sides and just you know ...\n... ... pinch between the two uh and uh at that moment everything's slowed down ... everything's slowed down and it was if I had all the time in the world to figure out how I was going to\nManeuver your way around a\nYeah and the next thing I Know I I I maneuvered through and next thing I Know we're on the other side there was honking going on in the cars when everybody was safe and a time got back to normal speed again\nBut then I I think that I think what what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point and in the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my spirit friends have told me there there is no past there is no future it's all just an eternal now\nAnd and that that's what I felt like and I and then I thought this is probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time 'cause in another dimension which\nWe might have had this horrible accident ... knows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour at each other like that uh you know that there could have been people killed\nAnd it's at least seriously injured and uh and we were unscathed and so were the other two cars thank God I'm so it so I I I ... that is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I\nI uh uh was playing around it was in a um\nThat shouldn't pass in the north end to with the island there is a a to bridge bands that go from the mainland too\nWith the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass silent and we always used to stop there when when we went camping and and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and\nI was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak up for the call you and I was running right towards the cliff\nAnd I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light and the warm\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was yelling\nSomebody's watching ... there's a there's some helpers out there for you I Want to come back in the mall but we'll talk more about some of these other thirty three experiences you had\nA or any of them demonic we'll be back in a moment on the coast to coast Dale

that\n[noise] yes unfortunately like that is that is also out there in the paranormal world and the spirit world than ... things as far as I understand have never been human\nNever will be human but they are very real and very scary out to a couple of them\nI'm One of them was a ah when I was about Eighteen years old I was in a very low place in my life very uh down I was a not very successful I dropped out of school a out of out of the University of Washington as living at my brother's garage sleeping on the concrete floor in a mattress\nAnd a ... just the the the night before this incident happened I I had cut across you know I I was Eighteen but I was still acting like I was a little kid I'd still cut across yards and jump fences and stuff 'cause just to you know\n'cause I it it just an old habit yeah anyway I went through the yard of of an old lady who all of us in the in the neighborhood thought she was a witch\nAnd uh she lived alone and there was a story I don't know if it was true that her husband had died and she left him there for a month until the neighbors complain that you know there was something\nSome kind of odd smell and then uh anyway so she's there legend grew by leaps and bounds\nSo I was ... I was cutting through her yard and I saw a candle light in the window and I just momentarily looked and there she was and she was very scary looking person she had you know this gray hair that was kind of shooting off and all direction yeah she had this\nSo I had the old ... syndrome right\nYes she had the ... camp as it turned out cancerous or on her nose and she had me I felt like a deer in headlights I was just frozen and I was just staring at her and she had it was either a it was a candle yeah she had a candle in the window\nAnd she was just staring at me and it it just scared me and finally I broke away from her gays and I ran to my brother's garage and I\nAnd I and I you know went in to to I fell asleep well\nLater that probably early in the morning I woke up to a very frightening site or at the foot of my the mattress bad that I was sleeping on the floor there was like a a column of fire that was coming up out of the floor and I I thought this is the worst during this is a horrible dream\nAnd so I pinch myself I slap myself and no I was awake in this column fire then spread over me and an arc from head from foot over my head you know probably six feet in the air and kind of like an art\nAnd like pulsating fire like a current a fire going over my head\nAnd it and if that wasn't scary enough there was also this this very dim what I Would classify as the demonic low gravelly voice speaking in in ... just these guttural tones\nAnd I'm not sure how long it lasts it it might have just been a couple of minutes but it seemed like it it took forever\nAnd ah it it was very very frightening and it was it was horrible and and I after it was over ... I was you know my heart rate was way up I was sweating I immediately called my my girlfriend and and uh I told her you know something terrible happened she said well you know why don't you come over in in in the morning and\nShe said well you know uh I think maybe we should call a psychiatrist what do you think and I said well I just forget it you know maybe I just made it up but of course I didn't see it happen and I I think it had something to do with this this old lady I think that I had frightened or or major angry\nAnd something had been some and and I it was a terrible terrible thing\nAnd that that that's one of the experiences I've had it's one of the most scary things that's a that's ever happened to me and just as as I remember it as if it would just happened yesterday I could feel the heat I could hear that gravelly voice that just seemed to fill the whole room and yeah it was it was it was horrible\nWouldn't want to go through that again would you\nKnow no it was it was it was very real very reel to reel and uh nothing that it it's like I think what happens is that these kinds of things you know when you're at the lowest point in your life and that's when you're susceptible a and I I think that that that they seize that opportunity\nI think so too I mean they they know when you're down they know when you're on drugs or you're drunk yeah and that's when they get ya and they get you a good time but I don't want to dwell too much on the humans but tell us the other story\nWhile the other one ah also of a foolish kind of thing or are there was actually a um I was in Germany I was a soldier in Germany at working at the prison the military prison and Mannheim West Germany when it was east and West Germany where West Germany\nAnd uh there was a a a counselor at the prison of all people a counselor is like a senior and CEO and he\nWas into a a a witchcraft\nSo he had invited me and my girlfriend to his his room to because he was bragging about what a you know powerful war locker which or whatever that he was in\nAt the time I was kind of I'm kind of interest that kind of you know skeptical been interested so we went in there it into his room and he had this very frightening set up you know the very typical Satan worshipping kind of stuff upside down across uh a goats had kind of thing going on and candles and\n... and that stuff so I said well I you know I don't think this is anything that I'm interested in and I got my girlfriend and we left and\nAnd he was being very very spooky and very scary about this whole thing and and uh so I decided that I was going to look into a a you know this kind of thing so I I I I thought maybe as a defense you know I maybe I should try to one of them you know and try to scare him or something and\nAnd uh and I also felt like maybe he was trying to move in on my girlfriend too so I had a little bit of that you know kind of thing going on competitive thing\nSo I I went to the uh you know for soldiers they had a art rooms or like arts and crafts areas and and uh there was a a um [noise] uh ceramics instructor there and he's I asked I'd like to you know do something with some clay and he said gave me some clay and\nI had been looking at a deeper knowledge the book and a or no no he had a demon algae but that's what it was and I was fashioning a a what I thought would be you know some kind of scary looking head then it would turned out to be a demon head in Rhode Island fashioned and this was just you know very stupid to be doing this\nAnd as I was doing this this guy took notice of made this instructor then he had the steam and all the G book\nAnd uh he said you know I'm very interested in this what is this year doing I said well I'm just trying to make this scary looking had the scare this guy and he said well it's\nThat's very very interesting you know I'm very interested in in the mid ... and he started to get really strange you know just like the counselor at the prison he was acting very strange like they were maybe birds of a feather or something\nAnd uh so I finished this demon head and I got out of there and I took it back to\nThey're at the time but her ... her girlfriend a roommate letting in and I set it up on her night stand and there was like this mirror behind it and I said okay I'm ... I'm going to freak her out and then I'm going to freak her out and then we're going to go and freak out this other guy and get them to get you know get away from us so I set up these candles surrounded stupid right\nSo uh I was all the time it was the intent was good right\nIt it was it was maybe a good intent but it was playing with stuff I didn't understand so I'm sitting there looking at it and the girlfriend left or I mean the the uh the roommate left and I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the sing all of a sudden it's lips started to move\nAnd it started to say things in that same kind of guttural voice that I had heard before I joined the army and that that other incident that I told you about and uh it was it was it was pretty scary and I thought at first this isn't real but then they kept happening and then my girlfriend walked in\nAnd she immediately said what are you doing and I said well your roommate Libyan and then she said what is that and she pointed to it and I said oh that's the thing I made to scare the you know this councilor guy\nAnd she said you know that's very interesting because when I was in it and then she was telling me when I was in high school I made something that looked exactly like that and I had to throw it away because it started to interact with me\nAnd I and I said well that hey that's what this did you know and she she freaked out she grabbed it she opened up the window and from the third floor she threw it out the window into the dumpster that was down on the in the parking lot\nAnd she said you don't ever play around with that kind of stuff and uh so that was the other kind of demonic incident that I that I had so that the the big lesson there's don't play around with things you don't understand even if the intention might be ... somewhat good\nAre these are forces that you you don't want to play around with it and if you are at a low point or you invite them in that's when\nYou can have trouble you think you invite them in with the ... board\n[noise] oh I I don't play around with lead you boards at all I think they're very dangerous\nMade you you you you had a nine eleven premonition than you\nAre yeah ah yeah it was interesting I was a indoor folk\nThen they can be in about ...\nDo you think we really like [noise]\nThere's you know we're so glad you good di di di\n\n\nNa na\nNa na na\nNa na\nNa na\nHuh [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] bird\nOur\n\nOur\nNa na na na\nNa na na na na na na na na na na\n\n\n\n\n\nDo they just they just really what Obama was saying you want to be calling me with a guy that I talk about their own\nHome [laughter] [laughter] I remember\n\n[laughter] not by a\nOn the line Sean\nDa da da\n\nDa na na na na na na na na na na\nAnd [laughter]\nI'm On the\n\nLadies and gentlemen adjusted ... daily brought this radio\nDoubt that go away you know media will call radio oh God\nThat's where you at right now I'm through with a long\nCommute out by an ad in the morning\nMonths there on one of the fence going oh\nThere's no radio\nNo ... ... ... when the\n\nNo and then on the\nRadio on\nMaster control center and all this is W.

I can identify with with that guy is going through he's earned everything he has he's just trying to do the right thing this suspicion is completely unwarranted about everything he does\nAnd I think a lot of them overtime are starting to look at Trump and and their opinions are changing and because they identify with him\nAnd and you know I I think\nThat probably will do well the future it's not black support that's going to cost ... ... that's going to make this a difficult election in one week there's not black support is going to make it a difficult election twenty twenty\nIt's it's this middle income\nSuburban white\nVote that people are acting like they're embarrassed of stuff all the sudden they said the same things as middle income white suburb always wanted to have accomplished is everything Trump's doing they want it as a conservative Supreme Court they wanted lower taxes they wanted the the L Affordable Care act a\nAgainst whoever is in power at the time but I think if most people would take a deep breath and say I'm all better off to die\nVersus five years ago and we know the answer to that because we've seen troll ... number ... we know the black or unemployment is is over ... over the employment as a whole is lower than it's ever been\nWhat was that said I think the talking head on TV Cape\nBashing trail and throw in mind is why\nI think some people's focus is so short attention span is they start listening to that and then since they're saying it and nobody is refuting what they're saying\nCounting the signs on reading\n... I think most people at least people center right and on the right now that all this stuff that the mainstream media is putting out as a bunch of malarkey a lot of his designed to make Trump look man\nI think this march toward the border is one of them I think Chris named lousy Ford was another one I think just bomber is another one I mean I I just think it's all to make Trump look bad and I think people are starting to smell a rat even people that are that are a little left or center are starting to smell it\nWell I Hope ... and here is where\nMy mother raised me to think for myself\nMy family when you look at me and my sister boat\nUm\nWhat do you look at things and think independently I don't buy\nInto just somebody says something must be true you know I I Try to do a little bit of research and think about things logically and there is no doubt in my mind my household\nSuffered for ten years\nOh two years of Bush in eight years of Obama well let me go back\nTo the original point and and I do appreciate the call bill thank you for checking in with is um [noise] are you better off than you were five years ago I mean subject to the business cycle most most of the time that answer is always yes most of the time that has has always yes the ... the the time period too long\nI'm generally speaking five years is always better off than you were five years ago and so the guy running for reelection\nAnd celebrities come out and say there'll be blood in the streets of Democrats don't win the election won't burn taught about fascists in ... to a male is what I call it the other day is the\nRepublican Party is becoming more nationalist what a Trump said the other day I I'm a national is\nTo provoke report is becoming more national as the Democrats are becoming more socialist we really need to rethink ... bipartisanship [laughter] that I don't want a bunch of national socialist meal coalitions where where they gather when I was in law school my first year law school we were sitting around in the little break area before class\nAnd we would tell stories rant about plus he versus farther so now I don't know none other than we do the New York times crossword puzzles or group we would just you know just sit there and chat or whatever nerds and um you know why they're there was a widow huge Jewish population in our school we were sitting around one day\nAnd we were talking about Republicans versus Democrats\nAnd I said well can you guys at least admit this was in the wake of nine eleven there's two thousand three so right after nine ... the height of exuberance for us going to war in Iraq and Afghanistan on on your budget can you admit that socialism is creeping into both political parties the oh yeah absolutely can definitely admit that\nI said and can you add ... admitted that nationalism is never been at a higher fever pitch in this country I think there's a void I was like so we're becoming nationalist socialist and one of the Jewish guy goes wait a minute that doesn't end well [laughter]\nAh\nI'd say it doesn't end will probably I buy on their way back\nAll y'all [laughter] I\nKnow that James Cromwell guy\nLast night it is when I got like a robot that was by the hour on the green mile he was the director of the prison if you remember that was ... yeah yeah\nYou're you're a teacher and I saw that the day and I was like you know I Would have never thought of the folks like that that they would just\nBe so\nThey they think that you would in the breach is going to be what industry I guarantee you that he's not going to\nDie accidentally just about just saying you know who's not going to be picking up a weapon in them as James Cromwell or any member of the Cromwell Klan again if you're going to be sitting this\nOne on one on one amuses me as all these actors that come out making these political and social statement sure nobody cares nobody cares what they think they're not influence in one single vote in fact they're firing up the Republicans\nWell into their ... you know they they they for years have said they were led to a swift get by without saying anything and win the election was a little clip the polls were a little closer British and was trailing by two or three up in Tennessee that that may be Taylor Swift can push 'em over the edge so they brought Taylor Swift\nAt now trailing by like ten and they're not even looking at tendencies an option anymore I Know I mean did she hurt him I mean one one wonders ... are still like the swift [noise]\nAnd and frankly I don't like all the ... you could do a lot worse than Joe brothers and I don't want him to win the Democratic [noise] he's not the worst Democrats there's ever try [noise] alright forty nine minutes after eleven o'clock we'll be back in the whole cast of characters\nAnd [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nIs a better\nMommy Thomas Gray [laughter]\nI mean by that but you're only back tomorrow\n[noise]\n\nMaster control center says W.

[noise]\nHey Dan I'm just listening to your uh your segment of the Trump a recording of the two of\nThose are the immigration and nationality act like it to to visit not contain anything regarding anchor babies in that\nI ... I Do not know the answer to that but I\nJust I thought maybe somebody who your audience may have some knowledge of that\nUh I Know it there's an information in regarding a language a person went through organizations that are at first the constitution such as ah any group that would be committed to a takeover or\nChanging the constitution to accommodate their uh their organizational standpoint such as the Islam\nOr ... or on your sample giving him a decoded him\nOr immigration and nationality act or Nineteen fifty two I Believe there's a couple of a congressman that worked on that bill back in that day but I thought maybe there may be some language in their pertaining to anchor babies but they just haven't enforced this law\n... or makes me wonder if they did some things right in the ... the real I don't want to do we do when it's sixty five I'm big or good so have you have to read up on it real quick\nYeah uh and maybe there's some people are in your audio ... that may have knowledge on this and the whatever on I'll hang up English\nAppreciate your show very much well good talking to you again so let's go to the casinos um June bent on Trump and um their birthright citizenship\nWe're all here we are going to begin with this President Trump is considering a radical change to American immigration law just ahead of the mid term elections in an interview with jak sales website the president said he wants to end birthright citizenship which is guaranteed under the fourteenth amendment to the constitution\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world where\nIt'll be a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas is ridiculous and it has to end um have you talked about that with counsel young\nWearing the status in the process that will happen\nAnd that's what you're talking about really has been very interesting I didn't think anybody knew them but me I said I was the only one\nOf the good according to politifact thirty three countries off our birthright citizenship Jim van Nuys CEO and cofounder of ... was part of that interview with the president or the upcoming actually it was on HBO he's with us from Washington\nThere's a week and there's a lecture in a week away and the president is talking about this is um is this a serious policy proposal by the president or is this something he'd like to get in a big constitutional debate about for a week to keep the focus on a topic that he Thinks Works for him politically\nI think it's something he wants to do he clearly was surprising the interview that the swans reporting had figured out that he'd been talking to White House counsel\nAbout this I think he politically he wants to keep all of the emphasis on sending troops to the border or to guard against this caravan that's probably several months away from hitting our border and so this one he's been talking to he says legal scholars internally they say that he can get away with it\nOr we have a fourteenth amendment which basically it it stays pretty clearly that if you were born here on us soil you are a U.S citizen and he says I don't even need to go to Congress to change is I can use my executive\nPower to do it I I think it's a pretty legally dubious claim but he says no I've got people and say I can and by the way he has that the courts with a lot of conservatives and I think some of his confidence\nMight come from that and the thing with Trump you never know it was just an idea that's been floating around in his head and all actually act on it at some point I Would say when it comes to immigration he does feel ... and stuff even when everyone else has and you can't do that you shouldn't do that I Know the president wouldn't do that he still does it\nInteresting on let's go to a ... ...\nHow long have you been in\nThat I'm doing great um I Want to ask you a question but I like to comment about the um\nCitizenship I'm just glad somebody finally talking about it and look like they're poised to take action on it because it has been abused in my humble asked this question or very very well\nUm they come over here that have babies I met people that have that we're here simply out and\nYou know they could have a citizenship and then they'll lay and you know uh hopefully then when they can grow up that can come back over here and chain migration so it's it's a real problem\nIt's been abused and it's also been taking advantage of\nBy the left a lot of the many decades the\nUm [noise]\nThe ah what do you think about that I mean\nYeah I think it's you know the intent was to an Eighteen associate when they did this who are for the slave populations to be integrated into society and as soon as soon as I was the purpose of it\nAnd then you have some civil other acts that one that Bob at ... ... that are addressed the issue but it was kind of in Congress who is kind of group specific to choose the Chinese who's there was a law against Chinese become us citizens as\nIt is wrong and one of the things that government is outdated and then they should be fixed but will the Democrats went to ...\nWell of course they ... out you know the answer to that before you ask ... don't you know this is not something they want a big at all\nAnd you know I'm Wondering I it just seems like illness the election this midterm election boy to me they just feel like a lot like twenty six hey\nYou say Trump rallies just overflowing and Democrat stars like Obama and Hillary apparently I Would draw a crowd\nOr a lot of the left going just absolutely bonkers now making those remarks by James Cromwell that you know\nA Hollywood actor there they've won and the straight guy you know I just it just seems to me that I'm getting the feeling that there are a lot of folks out there that might be giving answer the question that they're not\nEver going to really be all about and I want to actually you know in twenty states thing was that anybody that actually measure the amount of people that were say they would vote for Democrats that wound up voting for Republican or ... but\nI'm not sure if there's a measurable I'm\nA a measurable way of doing that the reason opinion dynamic research\nGuided so right is what they did is they had a big gigantic basket of people and they always went back to that group of people and ask some questions to say that they were changing their mind so if they're undecided\nBefore they got an another telephone call and they they basically were awarded them gave him gift cards were doing this\nAnd that's why they're polling with so much more accurate than anybody else's and also it was done by states\nAnd so to speak to you remember we would always talk about say Fifteen states that were there and there were ... Fifteen states\nRight here is a bad at all and I think that that the best way to people was like seven thousand or something\nOkay so that you see any similar\nI I tell you when there's a great question bubble bay and the answer is yes up to the point of the mommy I think that the bombing do change some things and I think that we're on track before the bombing the bomber guy\nI think that that child or a woman that brings a child over that you know possibly with that I own some type of public assistance and has a child [noise]\nThey'll cost the taxpayer close to half a million dollars of their life um and and that's probably a ... under a minute of it but\nYeah that that is the situation and they'd be resolved he's the only person that has the guts diet it might not be popular for some of those who have those bleeding hearts out there but just the fact the matter no one else in the world I\nDon't think has the same rules or a laws as as we do they would not allow that half\nWell a lot as a lotta countries have turned have stopped doing it branch being one of the ones fairly recently oh sure yeah I'm\nSo [noise] but you know and the reason we rented the fourteenth amendment the way we did and the fact of CBS less some important information out is that I think something's gonna happen or in Congress with his opinion on what happens in the election\nYeah and that's I mean you know we don't know at this point when you start talking about that I that the things that have been happening\nThere's just so convenient I don't know there are ... there are ... out there you can see 'em all Facebook you can see him in any type of social media all this stuff just things like the most convenient time things happen and um\nIt is absolutely tragic especially in the synagogue and then of course this crazy person that sending out these bombs that may be still being are still in the postal service system but I just all this stuff just things so convenient I just I really don't I don't know with an MBA but\nI only hope that we can get the the next seven days and get through that and the other issues coming up\nYeah and if everything was stay quiet um then I think the ah the dams into progressive liberal media will run out of energy and they're saying and I think things can get reset\nBut what about Margaret caravan now\nAnd it was like I don't think there will be here in time I think what will happen is that\nYou're going to say the buildup of forces you to see a lot of coverage of the ... the Caribbean coming here but that say that's a positive for ... there's a positive for Missouri in Indiana and North Dakota Montana West Virginia but it's like that\nOr do you think they're ... there's also reports that I read this morning a there's reports that these people actually having Molotov cocktails some types of weapons they're taking with them I mean is there a possibility we could see something like they they\nIn a in France things like that where you start seeing the conflict\nWith the military I mean if that happens that's going to pay I mean that would be absolutely terrible and I don't know how the media would ban it but it's not going to be good for anybody involved\nYeah if the media fires own civilians even as they should they use it\nBe handled is going to be really important and um there's a difference between a border patrol agent doing that in a in a military now I Will say this I talked to somebody who is in military logistics who is going to be working on this project\nAnd they um they said the whole the everything that they're doing and and it was a real interesting press conference that happened yesterday I'm Talking about you know the fifty two hundred people that are coming there\nThinking of think of these folks says there in support and have a multiplying multiplier effect on the border patrol agent so instead of the border patrol agent\nHaving to have a chopper pilot who was an Asian fly them to pick up the uh the agents and find them to location they have very limited number\nOf resources to do that now they have a whole bunch of resources to it where they can just air drop a bunch of border patrol people with vehicles by the way into an area into his own that is about to get flooded and\nWhat they'll do is so the the drug people will get them to flood a zone and then they'll sneak over into another area and bring the drugs and\nYeah it's a pretty uh interesting that your wife's them down there I just I feel for the people that have property on the border I mean it's just I mean do you watch uh documentaries about it I'm old what they had an aunt that virtually gate and stuff in their own home\nAnd protect himself with weapons that all the time because they don't know what type of person that can make coming over the border and what they'll do bring but I just always wanted the last thing I'll get off the wire Congress no more groggy and all these other why have we done anything really\nOr to protect the border I mean we've got two years the term\nWas not live nothing's been done to fix that but why are we move forward\nOn when you say a enforce the border\nAre you talking about wall or you're talking about border patrol agents\nYeah you're talking about the ... the thin on the border I mean yeah border and then that the border patrols those guys in the ... we don't have the resources\nTo cover the ground we need to cover the bantering back and forth about the wall with the summer that going up but it's really been note for Bush from the Republicans in Congress really bad things that really do anything to fix the issue\nWhether they they did do some some funding for the wall\nThey did get more border agents are hired so those those are two positive features but again without the wall and you know the Democrats will say this is a ... century solution to a twenty first century problem which I don't agree with but\nThey they're they don't want the wall because they know that will inhibit um\nMigrants coming over immigrants coming over illegal aliens coming over and so the border wall means you need less agents\nAnd or you you you you can do a lot more with what you have not having the border well that's where you need the military and and they're going to have drones that are going to have you know started I saw a bright a vision type thing thermal imaging there they are doing it up right here\nLast thing would you consider the a\n... I'm an Asian yeah\nYeah that's when I when when Trump used terminology I guess when we first reported on a jury about a month and a half ago when you use that terminology I'm has said that that's exactly how he needs to counter this and it's not a bunch of people that are hungry coming this way\nIn his gay bones to Mexico in Mexico they choose not to say Mexico they had been offered asylum in Mexico and they choose not to take it\nWell above young a young male that's a lot of things that he has a lot of young male just like the all the all the Margaret among over the Mediterranean and from Africa if there's a lot of young well\nNo you don't know ... ... ... uh ultimate reasoning behind that maybe the bond work but it looks like a\nAn invasion force the may so that being said you'll have a great I think there was like oh\nThat's where it's going to be shown any who he bought one they're more show will be back right after this\nAnd you're listening to the damn more issue [noise] long Ninety three only one of\nThe [noise]\nRadio hour\nMonday through friday six or seven used on money three point what\nDo you really\nWhen the power goes out your light is disrupted in basements London security systems quit heat air conditioning refrigeration phones all gone\nYear alone forty one million people lost power for an average of five days and with severe storms becoming a common\nOccurrence it's only gonna get worse so how can you take back control do much in Iraq homes standby generator protects your home against power outages every second of every day all year long ready to automatically supply power to your home within seconds of an outage whether your home or\nBecause it runs on either natural gas around me you won't have to wait in line to buy gasoline\nControl your power all your\nWith the general rag homes standby generator\nWithout formal financing options available announced the perfect time for Mr electric to install an automatic standby generator in your own and remember Mr electric provides maintenance for backup generators to for more information and go Mr electric Montgomery today who\nActually is to kill us off of this radio do from ...\nA new song Johnny three boys want to have them re CD [noise]\n\nNow\nBack to ... news talk Ninety three point one WABC\n\nTuned to to a place where we are\n\nWant another one you don't need that nobody can you can just human emotions well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but\nThey're saying I can do just with an executive order\nBirthright citizenship is covered under the fourteenth amendment of the constitution the convicted Boston mob boss Whitey Bulger's been found dead in prison in West Virginia you've just been moved to that President from a holding facility in Oklahoma ... there were present in Florida box Boston reporter above board says Audrey\nMaybe nine years old we understand how your health we're going in for some ... ... or no wheelchair bound\nCause of death today has not been announced Fox News [noise]\nRich job us whether Rob do you buy a teenage carpet for all for covering it granted products C H U H garbage for the guaranteed best price range in age coverage across from Walmart on the Atlanta highway\n\nEverybody important weather changes on the way soon but for today's sunshine dominates very warm for October upper seventies to around Tahiti windy clear tonight not as cool when I look up to seven tomorrow very warm Halloween I Am a little bit eighties\nA good bit of sun you know I Can't rule at an isolated evening shower sometime during the trick or treat hours otherwise showers and storms become likely the overnight hours tomorrow night\nShowers and storms on Thursday some of which could be strong possibly severe would all modes of severe weather possible breezy high Seventy four down to fifty three Thursday nights breezy cool friday high sixty five\nForty four on Saturday morning at a cool first weekend in November with this a storm system coming in and you want to get our weather app on your ... downloaded today go to the store search rich Thomas weather from the blue water whether ... this is rich Thomas\nHeirloom jewelers specializing an antique an estate jewelry diamonds high end watches and more by selling trade with ...

officer retired as a colonel or I had a lot of experience leading people and and fixing broken organizations and when I retired from the air force\nI came back to ... uh before I retired so I could retire here\nAnd uh then got engaged in the community work for the chamber for a year and then spent a fourteen or Eighteen more years working in in uh the defense industry and one of the things we did while I was in that capacity was work to\nUh protect gunner in two thousand five from the brace realignment enclosure commission ... and was heavily engaged in a in keeping Gunter\nAlive and well

career people who are not performing well\nI don't know what you did an airport ... appreciate what you're doing out there and I tape because it's important\nBut uh one of the things I learned was\nTo know what I was doing before I did it and I I'm not suggesting that I'm going to sit there and and sit idly by and watch watch what's going on I wouldn't be running for this position if I was going to do that anybody can do that\nI'm running for this position because I Believe\nThat I Am tough enough to to make the decisions in and take the criticism that people have for making decisions that may not be suitable to their particular bias or prejudice\nBut that are in the best interest of the schools and if if Dr Moore is not the right person to have their then certainly uh I Would be in favor

think that uh you know I'm I've spent a long time and the leadership business and and in big organizations I think the the scope and in depth of the\nOrganizations that I've been privileged to lead and the results that I've achieved is taking organizations that were failing once\nAnd turning them from failing to among the best in there or in the in the\nLarger structure uh prepares me very well to\nWork in an organization and and lead a revival and an organization of the the scope and complexity of of Montgomery public schools it's not like running a small business because it's\nThere's a lot of real property involved there's there's large budgets involved or\nThere's well over ... there's two or three thousand employees in there so it's a it's a very large very complex and and very difficult organization to to get your arms around and and I have done that I've spent a lot of time\nTo be a Russian asset I'm Sorry if you've heard this a thousand times but this doesn't make sense if you don't deeply understand that the lesson tier Russian collusion narrative interest on the fact that the Maltese professor who told Papadopoulos about the rest of the emails was in fact the Russian this is obvious right bumps\nIf he wasn't rushing the obviously has no connections to Russian intel or Russian emails on Russian information on Hillary\nTopic they had something to say this morning about that which was absolutely just on it\nWe meet in Rome and I never quite understood exactly why I was meeting this person at a this University in Rome through my old company which I found out is some sort of a western intelligence a front group\n[laughter]\nI'm I'm a listen I bully laughing because I don't want to cry I'm laughing now in lieu of crying because this this is the only the biggest scandal of our time and at George goes on Fox and for instance boarding and and and just drops there's this enormous\nNugget of information so let me get this straight according to Papadopoulos he meets with ... and he finds that he has no idea why this meeting is set up but he finds out later that company he's working for that set it up has significant ties to western intelligence\nFolks\nIf you were writing a book like I did on this and you were fabricating story they couldn't write this story any better first by novel\nDo understand what he just said he did not\nDuring the United kingdom a\nHigh ranking intelligence official shows up at a training seminar to change our train or other Friendly's the Italians were friends and tell that they're not five eyes but they're friends of ours five eyes meaning the very deep connection but they are intelligence partners of ours in many respects shows up to train them with a guy who's a Russian agent\nAnd nobody's worried about this [laughter] so you're telling me a Russian agent you submit stood with a straight face showed up at a training seminar where the u._k. intelligence to change the train other Friendly's in Italy\nAnd nobody's worried about this at all\nRemember the FBI interviewed miss certain February and let him go why they let him go jokes if he's a Russian agent why they let him go even worse why did the state department joining a conference Mississippi was speaking at in February right before he was interviewed by the FBI [noise]\n\nThat's interesting\nSo this guy who also by the way has hung out with the ... so they are they can't find them right and his attorney or you're going to pick up with this has said he was working as a western asset\nAs attorney said that [noise]\nSo obviously this was a big show set up here so his company which is a front for western asset\nSends him over there to me with this guy you know they know he is with the Trump campaign he goes up and out of the balloon this guy says you know the Russians who got the Clinton email then asked them now for the information they didn't ask them promotion hit has offered it up [noise]\nSo there are two possibilities that then bunch you know it's going to lay out here as listening to him\nThere were only two possible explanations here number one\n...\nIs like Evelyn salt\nAngelina Jolie from the salt movies and it's so good at covering his Russian tracks that he was able to in bed himself in a friendly intelligence seminar with UK\nAnd Italian officials to train them well simultaneously acting as a Russian cut out not only that when I interviewed subsequently by the FBI when leaving a conference with the U.S State Department where you also managed to cover his Russian ties he was let go and the FBI found absolutely nothing\nSo explanation number one is the greatest Russian spy ever on par with Evelyn salt [laughter]\nI think in the salt books I think it's a guy I think they changed it to a woman in the movie I'm not sure I didn't read the book but he's been sample in Salt I chose ... Evelyn salt\nNow if you believe this I I strongly suggest you seek gay professionally trained mental health or individual cue because this would be the dumbest story in human history and he's a Russian agent infiltrate the u._k. Italy the United states and the state department and everybody let them go\nYeah that's that's only believable if you're really really dumb\nLet me suggest the story number two comes raise their right mind given all possible explanations except the one that's the most parsimonious someone said to me too oh you said that person money means keeps no way being frugal and explanations that's what I'm saying it correctly trust me give us\nThe explanation that requires the least amount of assumptions\nBy assuming number one show you have to assume the NPR I let him go in the state department let him go the u._k. let them go any Italians\nThe eighties we assuming he was a Russian spy watch a lot of stupid right there if you believe in ... that requires a real a whole lot of assumptions their focus a lot\nMore explanation number to Joseph Joseph soon\nWas not a Russian agent that was in fact they were stirred a bad had deep ties to western intelligence and that's why he was working with the United kingdom officials and Italian officials and U.S officials in the state department at this conference he went to or at least alongside them in this compromise\nAnd that's why he was interviewed by the FBI and let's go\nComes racer otherwise known as keep it simple [laughter]\nHe's nice about on this show or any we bought one be back with more right after they just don't\nWhy I Love you know\nIf you believe in them or love go\n\n\n\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center this is W.

part of what he's talking about is that they handed off the ball right on that out beyond the Russia investigation like the more\nThat separate from being probably didn't have no no you got to\nGet shot down there they originally the original thing that they were doing it the department of justice was investigating Russia collusion\nThat got handed over to mow the beginning point was that thighs award and the fact that Peter Struck and those people were investigating the Trump operation even though Comey told\nTrump he wouldn't being investigated that's what they were doing it under the auspices of that\nOkay All right so so let's get past that they will get all their true\nAll it all at once my point is people within the current crop registration had they have their hands on that have had their hand so for it even if if your if your primary to all of it is corrupt\nIt expands over into the current administration specifically if you're talking about the OJ you're caught my attention even though he refuses sale if all of this stuff was so wrong in\nJason Jason you need to get a new scorecard so you can play the game a little bit better let's let's take this so called me is the director of the FBI during the Trump Administration he gets fired his number two is McKay\nHe is he was there for a while after Comey was fired then he gets fired for lying to the FBI and he's under grand jury investigation that didn't have anything to do with Trump that has to do with McCain and the corrupt ... of the day OJ\nWhy they got then you've got ... who was sitting there during

actor as was Lisa Page the attorney for the FBI\nAnd it was as was the acting um legal counsel for the FBI that was there that I just got to testify before Congress he was there during the Trump Administration but he was a carry over from Obama\nBut that's my point is if you say all of this is corrupt if all of it as the crow and they passed the corrupt football to the Trump Administration while they're continuing to run with it\nHe didn't he didn't they didn't the the the two of them as soon as you know all the stuff was going to know the person who found no this is the inspector

D. classified show it would interfere with Mueller's investigation ow ow ow setting them up for an obstruction George are you is that a little hint the Rosenstein G. O. j.'s dropping to the Donald Trump\nThis is a political investigation only Trump now has political capital\nIs approval ratings are high and there's a decent chance we retain the house and gain seats in the Senate he has no need right now whatsoever to declassify around ... why because there's nothing there that damages him it only damages the bureau and the the OJ case there is no collusion\nTrump is waiting this thing out he's waiting to see what happens in the midterms because he doesn't need to right now is a political bank account as high if he loses you can expect the full de classification and sunlight all over this disastrous operation\nTo take the Trump team down this disgraceful episode in American history\nWhat are you saying that if they lose the house he declared serve as\nIf he wins the house any wage and waste it out\nAnd then I think you could actually go in and just kinda far lower and then release advice award here member interestingly enough motor is coming up with a statement after the midterm election\nSo he knows is there's no if if if the premise is why the people that have seen this in here there's nothing there's going to hurt Donald Trump and there's something that's going to hurt the OJ or they're saying that it was really being done wrong and I think the interview with Jim Baker was one a real important factor out of this whole thing\n[noise] so we wait until after the midterm they keep the house then he Miller does his base and then he he really says it\nAnd the question would be what his motives going to say his mind and say well we didn't find anything we're still in the middle of the mid term do how does he handled this the interesting thing is we're probably going to know in ten to fourteen days\nI Would guess the announcement would be the Friday after the election\nThat mother would do I would guess that that's where it\nAnd then the question is is Rosenstein do this on purpose\nDid he set this up the way it's being set up on purpose\nDid he say that no that would be affecting the mole or investigation so we can relate to that because there's going to make a day OJ look pretty damn bad\nCould make Rosenstein look bad too because he ... he signed off on one of the um the wards okay we're going to change topics we're going to get into midterm stuff before the end of the show but I Want to do but the Pentagon Cindy fifty two hundred troops to the southern border\nThe Trump Administration is also launching a major military operation to quote heart in the southern border and block illegal immigration that includes more than five thousand active duty troops to help customs and border patrol agent from Texas\nArizona and California and the president said last night he also plans tent city to hold migrants while they apply for asylum in the U.S now the operation targets a large caravan of migrants from Central America is now moving through southern Mexico Chang is that the White House for the president has\nThe border crossers our military is waiting for a new\nPlan is a promise kept by President Trump who has recently ramped up the threats of using military might to stop that care that critics say it's just a huge waste of taxpayer money and purely political ahead of the midterm elections the administration says it's just the beginning\nI'm sending up the military when you looked at the ridge loaded up with people that's called an invasion of our country\nIn a late night Fox News interview President Trump counted the military's deployments to the U.S Mexico border\nWhen you look at that caravan of a lot of people and there's people that are in gangs you don't want them in this country\n\nOkay so he said it in the military is trying to fit to two hundred people to know why are a lot of asteroids that are there particularly the drones and the helicopters and things like that\nI don't know if you guys noticed but when the Mexicans were flying over this group they sort of throwing rocks at the um as a helicopter because they were one of the Bronx would a hit a blade Roadrunner and up popped up a trip like that could have been done we'll right there\nSo now there's going to keep going with the Pentagon\nAs part of operation faithful patriots the Pentagon is sending more than fifty two hundred troops to the southwest border in addition to the more than two thousand National Guard already deployed there as well as military helicopters and giants pools of razor wire the first\nEight hundred troops are focusing on southern Texas the closest point of crossing for the caravan bend the military will head west to Arizona\nAnd California regularly armed troops will be allowed to carry their weapons but military personnel don't have the authority to apprehend illegal immigrants instead they will install barriers at ports of entry build houses for border patrol agents and supply equipment troops will also provide flights to transport agents to\nAreas where they are needed the most\nMigrants have already clashed with police on the Mexico Guatemala border reportedly leading to the death of one migrant and injuries to several officers\nIn recent weeks the president has put the caravan on center stage of his campaign rallies and even though it is about a thousand miles away he insists the time to act is now\nWe're not letting them into this country\nAnd the White House is floating administrative options to secure the border including shutting down altogether even to asylum seekers meanwhile because that caravan is still so far away it's not expected to reach the U.S Mexico border for another month at the earliest\nIt um\nThis this will be interesting to watch this happen and because of the way it was kind of explained to me put it somebody working logistics and I didn't realize until he told me how many people that are\nAre being tapped for um\nFor for\nWork on this from all around the country it's not just being there\nYou know if you've ever been in love you probably haven't have you ever been to the southern command that's the whole operation within itself they're monitoring constantly and they're they're pulling in as says and given a given the uh the forward to going folks in Afghanistan support\nSo this is really going to be something that you and have hot zones where\nThey receive through a night vision and throwing\nPeople coming across trying to rush the border and then they're gonna be able to drop in that zone a big group of border patrol folks and then monitor these people from the air and watch them come in and be able to direct a border patrol to where people come here is going to be a well about operation this book up it was part of that's been going to store\nWages thank you you know elections are about what's the turf here fighting on sometimes clearly the president wants this to her for the last week to be about immigration Democrats wanted to be about health care and we saw Brad ... scale yesterday the president campaign manager wants to be about the economy so what's it going to be\nWell I think also when the president says he's going to do that there are few a constitutional or immigration experts who believe the president can do such a move by executive order if he tried to do it it would likely be according to most experts quickly shot down\nBy

walked on stage like him to do yeah\nI mean ... that one night that's just crazy that one night when I was like in the to speak or in his monitor and has been just like through would doubt on the ground set Saddam wider fluids and all the fire\nIt's just unreal issued heroin in between your toes I mean things like that and I was a weird ... tonight we're here\nTo have another classic album battle now last week Brenda that I rented God get Ross how you do he's here again we had a great discussion about Michael Jackson's thriller against off the wall hurt a good\nDeal of it and I was I was worried I thought yeah we're going to go with all the wall over thriller\nShe but this is what happens when you go song by song and also southern would might know it was eighty four coins Larimer are Sharm\nIs you're going as you were invited last week but you had something go now that's that's what I Would just tell ya yeah yeah I had to take the border ... that's how I Do yeah I'll be there and I was like oh no I Can't be there I've got to\nTake the board practice but uh so you're here to help us and that's what happens when you do song by song where do you think obviously like tonight we're magical princes purple rain against the album the bold in Nineteen eighty five around the world and the day and you'd think obviously preparations going to win but wait till we get into\nThat rarified altitude so few or to get to see prince realize what being a superstar require he knew that to meet the demand for his music to feed the base of the celebrity he had attained he would be expected to keep pushing purple rain for all it was worth\nThe door to us than go to Europe maybe to Australia them back for a bigger us victory lap\nBut prince was to restless for that and so he did the only thing he always knew how to do in made more music which sounded different from anything he had done or anything is new fans might've expected and that is went around the world and the day comes out okay\nHe doesn't even want to hear this gets back to our conversation last week Quincy Jones and with Michael Michael would come out with these albums that it's like number one after number one after number one after number one as Michael would wait three four years right that would put together a really good song\nThey ... they would have multiple genius minds think about how to produce those songs and have him carry across on an album really well\nAnd so like with off the wall with thriller with bad\nYou're getting like so there's a five year period in between thriller and bad so no wonder he's got all these sits on these albums premise doesn't even wait eight months and he's dropping another album well you ...\nYou have to think prince didnt work with the top producers at the time because either ... ... that's what I'm saying he liked to have his own creative control and stuff like that\nSo that limits you a little bit then on top of that you know it's like he doesn't capitalize on on the run like you said right you know he could've took that victory lab with purple rain and made a bigger than what it was but it's a whole thing was\nOkay I did the American thing I've dated across seas once I'm kinda tired and performing it now and he\n... he didn't let it simmer in fact he did like he's like stuck it in their face\nHe said like he would not let the record company put out a single to promote the album around the world a day\nJust release it and it wasn't until a month later they put out the first single\nNow now this is my question do you think him being more of an introvert type personality played a part in it yes like she didn't like the the limelight yes they interviews and stuff like that he didn't push his music as hard as he\nCould he didn't he felt like purple rain was just ... you really thought a purple rain as I'm going to conquer the world and be the greatest rock star ever but that's not me I'm always this changing chameleon I Do different things\nAnd so around the world and the day sounds number one thing about this no promotion he doesn't give it time December\nIn the middle of doing this crazy tore he's writing this older album and it sounds like a weird psychedelic pop record not Iraq over the top rock\nWhile you're ... you have to take a prince prince want it to change is Sam and he's I mean just just when you think you got him in the left lane okay he's a rock star he's does Ron type of guy he's like you know what let's switch it up I Want to play a little more phone a little more so on this album and that's when he switched to serve\nIn it you know what it tells me or shows me\nThat prance actually had a on a true love\nFor music and creating music and creating different things other than just the celebrity I'm sure he enjoyed it and I was addicted to it at the end\nI like that but I disagree with you on that by him being an introvert I don't think he liked the cameras in his face\nAnd now I didn't I didn't I'm not saying that he enjoyed making media use oh yeah he might have and just as happy\nSo I'm going to end it out or myself I'm gonna do songs with like worked out jazz cords and then we're for instance think about it ended with purple rain in everybody's thinking he was purple rain and the first track on your next album is this [noise]\n[laughter]\nSo I could tutors so [noise]\nAnd people [laughter] [laughter]\nAnd if you get into it to the day before the days you could just get the ... to where you sit there and listen because there and again\nHe's not looking at it out like singles and stuff you just drop sailed ... now this album does go double ... [noise] it does incredibly well and that I Want to get into now the head when was this was all set\nWell you know you know you know why that was because you had the new new wave crowd of kids who picked up on it because it was it has such an underground following so it was like okay it's not as poppies purple rain was so this is our album duty this speaks to to us the you know\nHe'd never really I don't think it I might want to correct myself I I don't think he ever really want it to be like the next Michael Jackson no it didn't know he wanted to be the biggest coal store whole time ... yeah he wanted the guys that were weird and funky and felt left out he liked those types of people want to do that's the only way to put a\nAnd that that song you didn't even right we have one at least the Coleman I Believe her brother wrote that song and he heard it went well and it becomes the title track of the next album so let's get into that at all and let's go we get into things too much here\nWe have let's go crazy no of course pretty iconic song or using cap for one commercials\nWhat's new at it but we're you know it is and ah around the world and the ...\nSo head to head before I say anything when he ...\nAnd they just didn't know question to me let's get crazy let's go crazy yeah\nYeah yeah I agree it's let's go crazy all the way it's such a cool so I like diversion from the movie the extended eight minute version more than the rainy over real because the woman who was weird and\nI Love the route of the revolution could jam and go into different sections without missing a beat really cool stuff um\nWhich are a lot of people don't know there's a prince early on in his career actually uh did some work with James burn right so that's where you know he kinda got a lot of his\nI Want to say orchestrating shops from 'cause I mean James didn't know how to play instruments but he know how he wanted stuff just sound ... and prince was like that like you know what I liked that guitar riff but let's try putting it here is that it here right and it would change the entire makeup of\nThe song and he could play all this stuff so mess and what's cool about both these out on the other way and it wasn't true later and ... earlier he actually is working with a revolution all these out so they're very much the same group in mind working together [noise] uh but I agree let's go crazy too good the guitar was crazy good\nThe the the things you don't think about like the rhythmic aspects of it and the song itself lyrical\nAnd you're in ... in the mood to put chewing we yeah it's a ... at that and that's one of those songs you can't help but you're going to move something you and you hear it come home yeah\nWell and it's really about it and that's what's cool that disease real about God and the devil\nDon't want the the elevator ran down yeah uh yeah anyway\nClearly when so let's go to track to where you're at okay arranged take me with you against Paisley parks well we're all around the world and days Paisley Park\nIs actually close because I'm like ... I like pay close\nI don't know him by name you don't know I'm I'm I'm the dude that just listening to the radio up here oh no I'm not the ... music gurus like your job as this wouldn't take you back to the same way [noise]\n[noise] oh yeah [noise] yeah\nI Know I Want to go in there was a riding on the bicycle I just don't know about ...\nBasically barks kind of a weird blues\nWhen it comes in [noise] and I like this well for the [noise]\n\nI think I'm yeah I'm just saying about say\nWe're affects those guitar overdose diversions where it's like okay this is just like a\n\nAnd I don't know like as I listen to these I'm going with I'm with you Brandon I'm go with that's three for three yeah yeah he likes this one ... a little more rock and a little more fun okay so that's that's one the\nOne in the ... that's why I Love doing these album breakdown keeping score over there oh yeah I ... I had to it it's one to one\nSo let's go crazy when the first track now out on that pays like\nBark wins the second tract slot\nAnd that brings us to number three\nNumber three on the parade album is the beautiful ones ... number three on around the world is conditional bart\nCondition of the heart [noise] both of these are\nA ... but the way the sun is slightly different though\nRiver regions news blog strange and used on a three point one do you see the news off and they\n\nBattle [noise] as we we did Michael Jackson's widow and friends [noise] boring against or a around\nAnd the day [noise] can you think obviously are boring but right now we're tied up to to to to because what we're doing this this song each track track on against track on track to instructed to track for track showdown\nPut I think that's on a better way to do it but not much else Dario ... bringing a ball fair or his other one I'm just telling here on those shows as it as don't get me started now tell us how to do in any way\nNow I'm offered mopping now whatever let's get the tracks by this is the end if you're listening on ... pi is the end of side on track\nOn boats albums struck sideline purple rain hard to beat the so\nDarling Nikki against track five on around the world that day tambourine\nTambourine Chris Rock is\nAnd you got you got darling Nikki from uh Dave Chappelle doing the doing calling out the plays on his show [laughter] computer blue\nBlue darling Nikki shoot the jury shoot it suited but I think hands down this a darling Nikki of course it's a weird ... it's like a metal so\nAgain well if you listen to the words it sounds almost like a torch so\nThat they used to call her back in the back in the days of jazz and I'm like that when they talk about sex and stuff like that they call it the torch so\nAnd that that's what it sounds like\nTo me but then you listen to music and it's like a weird metal rock song was an interesting but it's unusual rhythm for mental but\nThat's what it is it is I Will try to learn guitar odd chords we're timing and progression\nIt's just a funky funky so and and that's that's kind of part of the magic of Brandt says he was so talented on the guitar he wasn't just good could write like that cat was ... and going the wrong tambourine ... an acquired taste\nFor folks who have ... sorts of sorts [noise]\nIt's it's an acquired taste it's I like it because once you get into it and you understand where the songs going there like that's funky as well and it's really cool but it's an acquired taste it of course of course and I think hands down all day every day darling Nikki is a better so yeah that's the western purple rain pulls ahead\nOf course like I like I said he got rated to carry this is science fat and so we're on the beside huh\nSide B let's go\nOutside to for over in starts off with the iconic\nWhen doves cry winter\nYeah [laughter] I\nDon't care what it was not even up against America on the around the world and the day on that would even be ...\nI mean that's just see I don't know I Would argue with a window now I'm On my way to make you want to argue argue I Would rather Lynn's into raspberry puree\nOver ... you know why you don't you don't like a lot of princes pop hits anyway how do I love all of prince's music has no no no I'm Sorry I didn't say you didn't like his mask burns you don't like his pop\nHit on a saying raspberry Braves more\nPoppy solved when doves cry and also I think the ... brand and fallen out of his share of ... is coming from a place of windows cries overplay it\nThat's the ... and ... number one song of\nCourse and we said the same thing about the early ... that it was just it was it's right at comic but like tomorrow is Halloween think you're not going to hear that\nSong South Florida when doves cry I don't want to hear it on the radio I Want to hear or if I Do I Want to hear the album version because at the end when everybody is not a forty five collector like you know but at the end of the album\nVersion when doves cry you get a nasty guitar solo and then the keyboard so low and the story behind that song and its besides Seventeen Days really cool he made these songs and like a night\nI understand that but we don't really cool stuff but but most radios don't have nine minutes to play the extended version understand them and the explanations\nUnderstand and then all of that this is the constant cursive especially popular bands it's like I I Know you want to hear when doves cry for Iran and raspberry bribe prince broke out tambourine born not you're gonna make us die hard really\nHappy man he's playing that song you played that song raising a\nBut but see songs like that got played um way back in way back in the day back then um a lot of people don't know bands to build up high they wouldn't have secret shows yeah you know they would\nGoing to be performing at the top of the Empire State building\nYou know just just something crazy like that and it would be up to that one than the spread the word to everybody like Cape print than the revolution and are going to be on top of the Empire State building\nAnd it secret little shows like that yes you will hear stuff like tambourine where I'm you know stuff that that that normally don't mail at this stage the deep end did that don't make the state's show\nBut then we move on because unless I mean I have to say when doves cry is almost like anybody who grew up in a home or things weren't always great\nLike it speaks to you is that it's a very well done so that could easily have been to maudlin to over the top and sad but the way he gets it\nIt's just weird mix a sex and then the motion and like he's very good at using all those different feelings and presenting it they're really\nGood I just I Want to get back to the electric spying in there where it goes ...\nThe ... Puerto windows that's far ... well see you have to make sure what you're talking about they're the only way that you have to watch the video ... just watch it again I don't let it I'll\nWatch the videos [noise] okay who wants to move on and so that makes it was five to to\nAh yeah purple rain or ... or to do in order to afford to do because we're only on trial\nIn the beating keeps go\nOr that was a number six were a number seven here Mm I don't know ... to ... go OK number seven on purple rain\nI Would die for you great track\nBy its up against the song we came into\nPop life\nBoth songs were very similar because both songs were performed there not prince alone in the studios so it's the whole revolution\nOut daffy duck hit song we came in to hit it does a little bit more [noise]\nThe lyrics in the song I like better than I Would die [noise]\nOn that but it's still cutting his heart of this around the world they've FU to celebrity is what's the matter with your life\nPoverty bringing down the mailman dragging around each with your million dollar check in somebody else's boss [noise]\n[noise] [noise] that that\nYou're not going to change them out on the [noise] maybe I I I have to disagree okay where where do I I I did I go with this one ... hour light prince talking I Love the songs raise [noise] telling his story right [noise] they just great storyteller [noise]\nWhat's the matter with their world was a boy when he wanted a girl [noise] we'll straight hair and got no curl [noise]\nAgain it's I I just like the the song better because it's more like oh wait you're complaining about those things in life here let me give you something to ... you know it okay but I'm not in on that day but I just like it sounds better okay enough then so I'll let you to say I would die for\nYou it doesn't need the money is it ... the ... the anticipation when it first comes in the [noise] what\nIs what does the word I'm looking for the the drive the the whole makeup of the song come on that it's actually a little cheesy\nIt's got a little bit of a cheesy pop to it as a little puppy and think about it I Would die for you come on man how much more cheesy can you get then oh I Would ... wait a minute wait a minute of the woods\nOh gee do I look down or my wife but I've been married for Twenty years\nBut we don't sit around listen to the same way I go to a vote for my sponsor ... over for all the pets her motives pop life that's ... ... okay I've been over ... okay now we're going through to on here\nSo that makes it what that is for three four to three and it's pretty neck and neck ... so we're going to track eight uh-huh\nOff purple rain baby I'm a star good song it gets a track eight on around the world the day the ladder", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Coosada", "day": "30"}
