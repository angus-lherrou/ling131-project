I think there were a couple of vitality so that's that's the saddest part will not yeah\nIt's bad enough when the chickens get their heads all chopped off hunting but you know\nA [noise] there's all kinds of stones rusty you know a now\nYes I'm a very conservative guy and I believe in conservative politics here but I got a science background and I'm not trying to get anybody angry at me are mad at me or anything like that but it's obvious to me that the storms are getting stronger is obvious to me the earth is heating up is obvious to me that ah there's things going on do you think is\nMore global warming or\nClimate change because you know throughout history the climate has changed from time to I mean I mean this area right here was once like you know ice and stuff\nRight and good use yeah if you remember the little ... in the they the the problem are what they should cause ... was that the sun itself became\nA little dimmer our little cold or what are you going to\nHappen some of these things happen that's true some became a Democrat is that what you're saying\nNo\nOkay uh get it is that the sun has a lot that that's what's called natural phenomena of yes we don't know what the actual is going on but we have heard I've read in recently that the sun is going to go through possibly another cycle like that again which could all set the carbon\nThat say oh two in the air\nWe are rising up all its CEO to end it does cause cause the earth to heat up\nA we know this it doesn't work for for for industry to have to here's the problem with it\nIf we get laid down some actually over spin on trying to protect ourselves and our economy crashed mhm see is a delicate balance and I don't really want to say which way is right or wrong when to say that it's not happening are couldn't happen\nTo me as kind of foolish and to over span and make it where you can't even do anything is also foolish words has got to be a happy\nBalance honest no you know as soon as he was out of the White House Al Gore starts this thing and it and the man's got no credentials than ours on a ... and he he's he's making money hand over fist styles made a lot of money off and it just it just and some people will just about believe anything you tell them\nRight and they they sometimes they would be the uh they be the most vocal people's if you know what I'm\nSaying what you got to understand is that in the uh\nSocialistic kind of government yeah is that you know when they do research\nI had a friend of mine he's a scientist to he said look where the money is coming from money's coming from the universities are coming from the government to study climate change course they're going to be pro climate change okay I understand that influence\nBut I also know when you see storms getting stronger mhm you can call it natural phenomena but it kinda scares the wits out of me if in the year twenty fifty or we say oh we wish we had done something maybe we would I don't know but I probably won't be here to see it but somebody will be\nWell you know they said that ah those the stone that just a hit here recently Michael yeah that uh they had not had a storm like that in I don't know what forty fifty years because they say it's the strongest storm that ever hit that area right but it could have just recycling back through and then\nRusty thank you bet that they don't put that chickens outside or is he still in here\nActually uh well from the old song the chickens in the pan out I don't understand what that actually means but uh he's he's over there and ah he's he's just kinda he's got some of those French fry tighter shrimp Carl out oh always on our porch\nBy the way it's kind of spooky when you come up and Carl says they are yeah yeah and he's a he likes he likes he likes fried chicken or working on Wall more when I saw him a minute ago Mm [noise] but uh they're they're all out front we're in here where we're safe yeah and you know that's something you we all need is a safe place\nAnd and and a lot of times you're not just going to find that you have to get somebody to help you put together a safe place and that's where you need to have your portfolio in a safe place and I'll tell you the guy who can help you with that\nAnd that's David ... Thirty years in the business called him up to seven ... seven for three one he will help you out he will not let the the storms gets you he'll he'll not let the chickens ... stuff he'll he'll take good care of you to seven nine seven four three one\nMake it a safe place ... you know these folks and I got one I got several of them you know guns\nYeah you got to put them in a safe place yeah I put mine in a safe and lock it up that's my safe place ... ah because you never know when these young chickens well young against youngsters might get a hold of ... you know\nAnd uh so you've got to be careful so any kind of thing that could happen you accidents if you want to call the market drop in an accident you know you will call wrecking your car and acts thing is is probability there's probabilities says if you drive a car Seventy five years\nOr longer yeah a year ago and be in an accident that could cause a fatality now my brother was it in one indicting Ninety seven Mm they and they was several fatalities ... luckily everyone in his car\nSurvived ... but the others in the big big big big all huge gigantic vehicle uh they did not was was his his uh his fault or the other people or the other people I pulled out in front of him while\nHe was a huge huge truck pulled right out in front of me knocked backs off of it they turned over and burned a while but\nWhat's the chances of that when you you you're driving around in a ... as a small SUV and you'd think that this big truck when you hit it just goes to be smashed you know what happened that vehicle\nWas so does that and for safety when that disaster happened mhm it came apart the way a vehicle that would be safe for them are just like that condo though I have down in Panama City\nThat kinda was built under new specs new laws okay and when the storm came ... there's the that that roof next door the pineapple whether the release calm mhm you know and there's roofs there was another ...\nI don't know how much damage we had on the roof but uh you know we're we're still assessing that but he does it seem like it's anywhere near our if any true damage [noise] the thing is if you have a portfolio and you put that thing in here for protection\nA ... you won't be damaged as much if any\nIf the storm hits ... that's what you want to do him people say how do you do that how do you put a portfolio into that specific safe zone but that can still make money listen that condo down there is still makes lots of money people rented my outlet crazy they buy into it\nBut the storm didn't blow away all these other people around here where there are other condos ran their bona way they're going to be hurting their ... their income went down their portfolio went down so you got to be prepared\nFor portfolio erosion are crashing\nEither one portfolios grow mhm but sometimes they run out or do you know you ever seen do rising ... OU\nEventually quit rising mhm and then if you keep on cook and eat is going to collapse in turn into something looks terrible just flat thing yeah overcooked Mm So when the portfolio starts getting overcooked you got to take it out of the oven and let it kind of cool down a little bit and put it in a safe place where he won't burn up\nAnd you don't want your portfolio to be gone with the when you know my friend drawing on Anchorage down the best you can read an anchor with a professional that would be David artist\nSo we were talking about just a few days ago a few weeks ago there\nAre a lot of experts were saying is the stock market's going to get its its top heavy look what it did\nLook what he's doing mhm is it is it going to correct who knows is it going to keep going up who knows but do you want to be in a in a vehicle or an airplane or whatever it is that it's got buttering going oh\nAre you rather be down on the ground where you are safe again\nUh let me see [noise] yeah I think down on the ground where are you going to be safe you know you get up in that airplane you here's butter and that ain't are\nGood for you know I don't want to be on some kind of buttering type of vehicle or a ... you know in ... your portfolio is the kind of thing 'cause it gets you where you need to go in your in your retirement\nAnd uh it's just like trying to get some place you want to get there are you getting a good car if it's safe to like my brother's car kept them from losing their life ... you get into a good portfolio will get you to retirement keeps you from Lewis\nRetirement I have people coming out of time and I must tell you this guy came in and he gave me permission to the values and his name but I'm going to use his terminology there you go I showed him how we do everything he said you know what\nI did and said do you do he said\nYour portfolio is sort of like bonds on steroids and I said can I use I coined the phrase and I'm I'm using the\nYeah bonds\nYou know a on steroids there's these are insurance products that utilized bonds corporate bonds\nAnd the interest that they ... they buy options with strategies and things like that and so these things are guaranteed the principles guaranteed a everything is guaranteed in the interest that goes back in his guaranteed\nIn anything that you make that goes into it is guaranteed to never go away mhm so since the insurance companies using bonds to drive that and options to drive it\nYeah I think about it is bonds on steroids ... ...\nThey were right there bike ride but if you give if you give a a racehorse a bunch of steroids fro for about a year that's a horse can run pretty fast then he's probably going to drop dead\nYeah keep feeding him steroids yeah that won't be good well that's the reason why we reset these things every year every year we re say they would get a new horse uh we get an a so called new options you tried in the old horse for a new that's what the insurance companies that do they get a new when they keep you of fresh brand new horse you ever heard it on these westerns come flying\nIn and they gave me a phrase shoulders Pony Express you know short yeah we these insurance companies give you a ...\nA fresh auction every year on your what they call strategies\nAnd so what happens is\nYou're always fresh you're always running strong in their funding this thing with bonds so you got bonds on steroids every year you get a ... and it gets on steroids and we just keep on going I asked for fresh shores and they gave me one and he said Hi sailor\n[laughter] you know in a\nMan you got the wrong TV weird horse that was the wrong western you\nYeah [laughter] I Can't imagine [laughter] ah yeah that's weird true grit and you know [laughter]\nI'm just going through all these things I could say that but get a second off is none of that ad on trying not I'm not saying we need to stay on our ... yes we should yes\nSo that's it you will to stay on your horse or you don't want to get bumped off\nA ... I used to ride horses when I was a kid and a lot and uh I got bucked off quite a bit but I learned some tricks about staying on horse you gotta learn some tricks about staying in your ... your portfolio staying on the horse in other words if you can put your portfolio on a bucking horse\nIs a good chance you can get bumped off yeah but if you put your portfolio on a horse that just Gallup strong and tries to keep you on the back and if something goes wrong that horse evens out that ride for you and then when you get to the end of that year to you get a fresh or she keep running again with it\nThen your portfolio just keeps on going you look over to the side and maybe somebody else had that bucking horse in the portfolio is scattered all over the ground he's laying over there all broke up and everything and and he broke his crown is just not a good thing when you get it off the horse\nSo that's it the the storms of life um [noise]\nNo I'm not all negative I'm all about using the market with these ... these programs used the markets my friend the thing is we use the markets in a smart way we use the markets where we can't lose today tomorrow no way we can't lose money in the principal's guaranteed\nThat you basically the same person so you might as well vote for the guy the devil you know that essentially their argument that's the best that the star ledger can do is get down and vote for him and end up with\nIt it's it's unbelievable and the wall Street Journal the good job to put those in perspective those the logic that they had there and the sad thing lore about the whole thing is here's a guy who's been in Washington for twenty five years sixteen years with Democratic president\nAnd he has nothing to run on it's like come on you want is a job interview for another six years and I want to talk about how much attack the president I'm going to attack the candidate\nI'm not going to tell you and he had done to help you with the people in Jersey or so over taxed he's voted for more than five hundred tax increases and this is a guy that you're going to reelect it's time for change\nWell the the amazing thing again just going back to this pathetic endorsement and the star ledger which is still read in in the state is that they the star ledger trashes Cory Booker and governor Murphy for\nEndorsing Menendez and they say someone better could have run so I mean ... ... ... again I just want everyone in New Jersey listening to this\nThere is no real argument for returning Menendez to power it's so corrupt and New Jersey that the only argument that they can make it he's not a Republican oh and Bob Hugh getting a praise Donald Trump and was just a one of his a chairman of your chair and finance chair and New Jersey\nWell I I imagine people are enjoying the economic revival in this country pretty well and especially a lot of those a Wall Street or who lives in New Jersey and commute into the city so the idea that they're not enjoying this economic revival brought on by Trump's policies as absurd\nAs people who Jersey really differentiate\nOn the fact that listen we want somebody independent of New Jersey at the short of the stick for so long it's time for the people in New Jersey tickets put first and and not some party or politics and in New Jersey is lucky that we've had the economic revival in the country because it's being dragged along and [noise]\nAnd we need to do things in New Jersey are going to focus on putting our state the right direction and higher taxes more government spending is\nAbsolutely thought the ... not the solution to the Jersey it's the problem and New Jersey and and and and I tell you you know we think about your children or grandchildren I have three kids my daughter works at your body over New York and my two sons are station to camp Pendleton and California in the marine corps\nI Want them to be able to come back to New Jersey when the time comes or raise a family et cetera that's the role model\nAnd so on affordable and it it's just respectful to the people ... people just deserve but it's time to restore honoring bigger the integrity of the office and that's where we're going to do on November the ... the mob but you get all\nKinds of you getting enough help from a outside and I know New Jersey is like my home state fairly liberal even though there's conservative\nElements and conservative kind of pragmatism in in New Jersey but are you are you getting enough help or you need it and if not and what type of outrage needs to be done in these final days to connect voters with a ride to the polls and so forth\nYou know ... you know part of part of the reason I'm I think we haven't gotten support or\nThe Democrats have gotten a lot of ... Schumer is put about seven million of Senate ... an hour as a democratic senatorial campaign committee in his own majority pack into Jersey and I think it's about ten or twelve twelve billion dollars of outside Washington money against me we're up and we haven't had any\nAny positive support financially and in terms of our campaign from the Washington Republicans but that's that's okay with us this is about the Jersey is Bob Bob\nSo they are as the whatever that's called didn't didn't give you any money or the or the or are in late in any\nUm no no virtually nothing I mean I I actually think it's like I think they did make a contribution to forty seven thousand dollars that I that I really liked us ally that goes but can you know but you know something that\nYou know that's a tough market in ah New Jersey because he got ... in New York media market you know bleed and said you got any cash I mean the Democrats are laying out the cash and look at look at what you're dealing with\nNo support outside support that'll just dying that year within striking distance here\nWill tell you the truth Laura the last poll and we stopped pulling a glass last night for the last like because we don't want you to talk of changing it's just it's just for curiosity pull actually last poll we had we trust because it had me down twenty two to start down a dump five then we're we're up\nTo is the latest one that we really believe this the great poll so you can told us as testicle tied to heat but we're actually Neal you were pushed ahead here now\nAnd that momentum is so clear it you know how how do you justify voting for a guy who has had this track record\nIndicted ... his best friend is convicted of sixty seven felonies for ...

polling\nThe the the way most people view this when questions\nAre asked with specific [noise] do you think that people who come to this country who\nHave no legal status here should be able to secure a passport for a child born here [noise] that polling on that if they if if the polling companies wanted to really find out the way people felt on these types of issues you have\nAsk questions with real specificity because again most people are busier the live they don't really know what this means birthright citizenship\nBut then when people find out about it because Trump talks about like what four hundred thousand people are born in the United states to illegal immigrants every year and it costs four point three billion dollars in taxpayer dollars to educate them and to give other federal benefits healthcare and so forth people are just like to watch\nAnd I get outrageous most people including in one of the most hotly\nThen the beautiful state of Montana Jon Tester is in the political fight of his life Matt Rosendale is with us or this racism very close a record amount\nOutside money coming in to this race just over the past week another six million and outside money poured into

coverage that you have to have to pick your if your places where you go but it would seem to me that the way the American media have\nAttempted to demonize Donald Trump just on the in the last a week or so were these horrible attacks and and on the issue of immigration I don't see Montanans buying that demonization and trying to connect you with that I really don't\nAge and I'm very proud to stand with the president his policies ... we've had him out here three times and the president will be coming to Bozeman again this Saturday at twelve thirty or to join us again for yet another rally and I and I'm thrilled that he's doing so you know his his policies of\nTax cuts and trying to secure our southern border and reducing regulation and getting these trade agreements employees um has been very very good for the state of Montana\nAnd and the people embrace those policies and they would like to send someone to Washington to help the president accomplished more I mean if we can get as much done\nAnd the last twenty months with with a Congress that has not always been cooperative and shortly the Democrats had been as much of a structured is that they possibly can cause is what can we accomplished in the next couple of years\nOf how much in a way of of lobbyists um money has test or taking in during his time in the Senate\nTo this is this is one of the things that demonstrate just how for from Montana Jon Tester is gone he is the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists in the country five hundred and thirty five members of Congress we have one million people here\nAnd he has received more contributions from lobbyists\nThan any other a member over one million dollars over one million dollars and why is that he stood on the stage twelve years ago and said he wouldn't be ... by special interests and now he's the number one recipient he literally bought a house of\nA million dollar high in the Washington DC and left Montana and his rearview mirror\nWell again Montanans are very smart pragmatic no nonsense people and I think Jon Tester talked a good game when he ran and kind of look like a burly\nGuy and he has put a plaid shirt on and then he comes to Washington and it just becomes one of the ... mosque monsters in Washington DC and he wants to he wants to continue the big spending ways of the Democrat Party and my friends are Matt Rosendale got

far the German government has not changed his position that still wants to stay inside of the Jaycee pie away\nBut nearly every German company folks with real money at risk made the opposite decision they have fled they have left they decided they are not going to run through the Iranian sanctions that President Trump will put back in place on Monday [noise]\nAnd there are other countries in Europe who are with us um and I'm convinced that overtime or all of the European countries will come to see if Iran is indeed the uh the force creating instability in the middle east and then we must apply all possible pressure to push back against that to fix it\nSo these sanctions going place on Monday correct\nYes ma'am Monday and they'll feel them immediately or will it take a little time to

any or up with the rise of solving and the challenges the EU is facing [noise]\nSo we have many places where the Europeans work alongside us we clearly have some were\nUm we don't share the same view the president\nHas been direct with respect to the Europeans taking increased responsibility for their own security that makes perfect sense most European countries understand that the primary folks who need to defend against the risk that Russia creates um [noise] uh reside in Europe and America [noise]\nAnd so I'm hopeful as each of these governments evaluations and sees that America is with

reported yesterday Mr Secretary that North Korea is reportedly preparing nuclear and missile sites\nFor international inspectors are what can you tell us about I Know you're going to go meet with you're now North Korean counterpart just a matter of days but what's the latest from ah North Korea\nSo I Can't say much about what's taking place on the ground but I can make clear that when I was with chairman Kim now or three weeks three and a half weeks ago [noise]\nUm he committed to allowing American inspectors to come look at a two significant sites and we hope to get them there before too long it's one of the things I'll speak with my counterpart next week about and then we do have the intention of a President Trump or German Kim getting together\nBefore too long hopefully early next year where we can make\nA substantial breakthrough in taking down the nuclear threat from North Korea um [noise] we're we're still a happy that they have been conducted a nuclear test in an

has the attention to the nuclear rise and [noise] we do everything we can to system in following through on that committee but\nI Want to move to China and Mr Secretary because all we've seen in in

have this chipmaker ban are in place I'm that guy got garner and a lot of um attention\nOn it's trying to I guess we're trying to target that stayed on a chip maker and China over national security

taken the law when you're ... you're just admitted [laughter]\nYeah ... ... worth so um yeah you know\nWhat your household income uh somebody now than they are giving money in savings at all um we

don't I'm\nSave up and pay it off or pay monthly um is there a credit union I Know\nLet you have a loan for the difference ahead of time ahead of time because you can't sell the truck if you can't cover the difference okay so on\nAnd then yeah I Would be willing to go down I mean two three thousand dollars below what you owe it sounds like it's one thousand dollar blows the blue book on it but you need to get this truck sold it's killing you\nYeah\nI mean I wouldn't go I wouldn't do ten thousand and the whole on it but I I Would drop down there a few thousand bucks in a heartbeat just to get rid of it your stinking payments ... and a month and it\nUm six eighty six eighty okay close enough\nWow yeah so I mean you you you made the right decision to get rid of it it it's an out of control purchase while over the top and out of control and\nYou know you're just going to have some of the truck for what you can get for it uh and if you get forty five for it fine if you get forty four for five to forty three four it fine or you know three four thousand bucks in our little small payments a whole lot more than I have an almost fifty thousand bucks out on a truck\nA you're reducing your debt substantially by doing that\nAnd it was what you're paying a month you beat you pay off that\nYou know a couple of thousand dollar loss in in just a few months she'll be done with a very very quickly so you'd be right on track you know you made the right decision but and I know I wouldn't lose ten thousand or wouldn't take a ten thousand dollar beating on it it doesn't sound like you have to in the situation but I Would get rid of this truck by Christmas\nSomebody makes you an offer you try to figure out a way to make it work Joe's with us in Minneapolis just got home from

know investing in your mutual funds near four one K. investing in paid for real estate they do these kinds of things that defense is avoiding stupid stuff that cause you to lose everything all the progress you've made\nAnd so that stuff like the right kinds of insurance the wills all that kinda stuff and so having a good solid financial plan is both ... and defense and that is one thing we find one of the data points we find with all these millionaires they really good at defense and um it sounds tedious\nIt it can be but we've got a thing to help you it's free it's called the five minute coverage check up\nSo you get your phone out and you text the word check up to thirty three seven eighty nine\nOr go to Dave Ramsey dot com slash checkup\nWith text little word check up to thirty three seven eighty nine or Dave Ramsey dot com slice checkup completely free and they don't really help you I mean it'll help you get that millionaire mindset going and that's what you've got to do Andrea is with us in Pasadena, California Hi Andrea welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHer I gave her having me on that um I don't either um my husband and I currently have any sense to me now you know totally again we've been living here about three months already okay um and\nJust trying to see what our next step is that we have about um solving dollars in credit card that we have about fourteen thousand and saving and we have going on strike they're really holding\nBut we're just not sure what else we can do with that I mean it could come and get rid of them and they're I'm not really sure what to do\nRight well you can we can do some math and determine if you want to just ride them out or if you want to sell the car now if you want to sell the car here's what you would do and you need to get the information gathered up [noise]\nYou need to call the fleas company and ask what the early buyout is meaning if I wrote you a check to day to get my title what would it be now should be less than the total love your remaining lease payments plus the residual value the buyout at the end\nOkay and um so you get that number that's like the early pay off without the interest on a car payment okay\nJust same thing in the early buyout number that's what you're looking for and then you compare that to the value of the car have you done that on any of these cars\nYes we have on both of our vehicle\nOh wow okay so we've got the actual numbers always talk about vehicle number one then what's the early buyout\nEarly buyout is thirty three dollars okay\nAnd and what the value on the car\nThe value of that car I Believe he looked at it but it's like twenty five\nAnd ... Kelley Blue book private sale\nYeah yeah my husband is that it's thirty two that's how much it's I'm kind of labor about\nI'm Sorry thirty two or twenty\nI made a mistake that the early ... thirty three ...\nAnd kept the Kelley Blue book number is thirty oh great okay so you can\nOnly lose a thousand dollars by selling that car you'd only write a check for a thousand dollars it'd be sold it for thirty two but you had to give the least company thirty three to get the title you're a thousand in the ... right right right now your lease payment is how much\nMy [laughter] at least eight minutes five hundred and forty\nTwo dollar them I said how many how many payments remaining\nWe have about Eighteen more payments okay\nI'm just putting that in here that's nine thousand five hundred and Seventy six dollars\nYou lose a thousand if you keep it you lose ten thousand yeah no brainer salad okay okay you see how the analysis now let's look at the second one then right what's the value of the second one\nSo the value of the second vehicle a twenty five\nOkay and one of the early buyout on it\nThat early buyout on it I'm ... about the early ... twenty five okay I haven't done the Kelley Blue book 'em out but I'm sure it when you're at I think actually I live in town and for that one where really in the hall\nOkay and what is the lease payment on it\nAt least payment is two hundred and thirty dollars a month\nRight and how many of those remaining fourteen why payment\nGuy so that um let's see here to thirty ... thirty two hundred dollars if you keep the car till the end of the leaves and hand them the case right\nYeah that's what I'm told us to thirty times fourteenth okay and that one is somewhere around fourteen thousand and the whole today okay so you get to drive this car for free\nUntil the end of this lease on that one you keep it 'cause I'd rather lose thirty two hundred and fourteen thousand and I drive the car\nOkay you see what I'm doing yeah comparing a total of your payments\nAgainst the amount you're in the hall\nSo that one that one I Would probably keep it for your husband's numbers are correct on their value I suspect there and I suspect you're going to keep it anyway because I don't think he's going to be that far off I mean we've got a fourteen thousand dollar deficit right now if he if he's eleven value is right\nBut even if he's half wrong it's still a seven thousand dollar deficit versus three thousand to keep it\nSo that when we keep\nOkay and you pay it out now is it overall miles\nNow that one way I'm Don mile\nReal ... and the wear and tear you're going to keep it up so you're not going to have to write a check when you turn it in fourteen months from now\nNow they're both saying that well that one's been great condition\nOkay good yeah that one or you see how I did that analysis\nYeah yeah that really clear that out track when they were really struggling like what are you\nOn that one and you know what I Would do is move on past\nA baby step to once you've gotten rid of the the big car the more expensive one and once you got rid of all your other debts except this but if you still had this one with the two thirty payments were just written a car all the way through the end here and you might as well keep the car you get no advantage to turning it in our early\nRight right you're going to write the three thousand\nTwo hundred and twenty dollars worth of two hundred and thirty dollar payments no matter what you do so you might as well drive the dad gummed car you know and um if you want to put thirty two hundred dollars aside extra in your emergency fun just to make sure you got that plus your emergency for uncovered the call yourself in baby steps to win three then that's fine\nBut that's how you do the analysis on whether to keep a police or not and um\nMost of the time unless you're close to ... unless you're close to the end of the lease you're going to be selling the car and that's what happened with the more expensive one there it's killing you\nSpell that one was based bite ya\nSo good question thank you for joining us ... if you've never heard the saying it's kind of a country saying you're getting ...\nWhich means it it's it's like a a a sheep getting its for removed that's where it comes from your getting ripped off as a fleece means that's why I call them car fleet says because if we take the value of the original\nMarket value of that car that thirty three\nBut that five forty two into a calculator and then I put the in value into a financial calculator with residual value at the end in other words the residual values what you can buy the car for at the end of the lease your your games up number at the end of the least you put those numbers the calculator you come back out what the effect of interest rate is\nAnd most of the time it's around fourteen percent\nThey call it cost a capital\nAnd they don't have to disclose the interest rate the AP are to you you know if you get a car loan you get this this cruising lending sheet that the Federal Trade commission makes makes them show you the a PR annual percentage Richard you're being charged but when you're leasing it's technically not that\nAnd so you 'cause you're renting a car and so they are not required federally to disclose the cost of capital or the interest rate but you can figure it out with a calculator that'll make you a ridiculous that's why we call it's leasing it's the most expensive way to operate\nCar the car leasing is a disaster\nDisaster as a financial decision just do the math you can understand what I'm saying\nThis is the rams or share\n\n\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the\nSmart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dog ...\nHave to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new it finds them for you\nIt's powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes identifies people with the right skills education and experience for your job and actively\nGr age\nYou know and I don't you know we had some hard times we did not everything was not easy you know wasn't it wasn't a just a cake walk the whole time but\nBut we uh we worked hard and I think it brought us together for sure we um we always had a goal that was that was right in front of us and that that was one thing we didn't fight about I mean like any other company we fight about stuff for sure what that one we were I Know that one being one of the most important ones we were not there on the same page\nLove it yeah that's one of my biggest thing even with a telling people when we when we're hosting a leading su classes I'm biggest thing is I get on the same page and he has we never fight about money mhm\nSo do they listen when you tell them [laughter]\nSo I think\nWe definitely had some resistance definitely you know it's\nAll all the stuff you talk about why why would you if you can get zero percent interest why would you not do it it's free money\nMm yeah no I don't get it is different so what is the key to getting out of that you've done at your coaches your blood classes you've done everything\nI think the key is vision I think you have to see where you're going I think uh if I have any criticism of myself but then I'm probably too long term oriented and I think that has been I Believe your strengths actually already weaknesses and focus on so long term sometimes I forget the short term when she helps me that\nHe's very very determined and on I was the one that that like at first started it started out on the journey and I was so excited about looking like I got

found out the truth the American dream is alive and it's available day for the people were willing to put it into work and the sacrifice\nI was reading a political article this morning 'cause aren't really completely lost my mind went down a rabbit hole and they were talking about the lead that one candidate has over another ... and this this poll and it's in a major newspaper four hundred and

of time giving and a monetary also mhm I'm you know and I'm\nOne of the interesting things about being my typing retired six years now and people ask me well how'd you do it and what's interesting is most people look at me about halfway through intel I Can't do that\n[noise] why why don't why do you think they say that\nWell if they have to be conditional plan I mean every day you make a financial decision you know do I say the money or dies and that\nYou know um [noise] so the the ... there's not a true statement I Can't do that the statement as I won't do that yes that I I agree with that

years old\nI'm you know so it's it's not it's not an education thing it the hard work very\nWell and and as you said the discipline to everyday make a good financial decision so what would you tell
