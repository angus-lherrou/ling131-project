I Know it now but money plays such an important role\nIn in our lives are being all aspects of our lives are career or lifestyle self image our marriage is our family our health us I mean they should have something called the money I cutest\nLittle you know I remember and I was gonna say it wasn't that long ago but his nearly forty years we had a class they taught us how to balance a checkbook right out of a creative budget by how to pay bills that are ... ... and\nI never want to know somebody had to show me no I mean you have to have mentors yes now I mean losing any little candy notice Mentos I'm Sorry there's a fresh Mike or you know [laughter] well [laughter]\nI mean it's at least luge even lose change has a mentor yeah money man yeah money money keeps them out of trouble yeah uh you know otherwise you'd probably get flushed the you know what I'm Talking about an hour to get in trouble when that happened one time or did it\nSo you know people need to know how to do this basic things like checking their credit report or you know balancing the check to check book what's the difference between the one in vast type it another you know the I mean just basic things\nIn a you know we talk about a lot of these things ... am not going to get too much into them right now but the thing you just need to know what your choices could be but\nYou know I I run into these people sometimes it's a yeah I got a four one K. but I don't ever put money ... why why do you have it well I mean they got it available at work who say they don't ever use it because they don't they don't they they just won't spend the money I guess I don't really know\nOr they don't match now let me tell you if they are not managing you four one K.\nOr if you want to put money beyond the match yeah you need to absolutely call somebody like me because we can probably do some things that would amaze you but if they match and then you fool one K. you need to do that\nFirst year as a matter of fact we we were just stepped out of the studio for a minute you gotta call somebody wanting to talk to you\nAbout their financial are cute and that number is ... three four two seven nine\nNumber is your piece of paper and write it down three three four two seven nine seven four three one\nTwo seven nine seven four three one and he's got a website\nRetire with Ernest does all one word rye rye retire\nWith earnest and everybody's got that answer to that and just go in there and oh yeah I Want you to open an early\nYeah your website over there at a ...\nA retired with ... and we're working on putting the radio shows only websites and we're working on a Facebook where yes we are we've got some pictures that we can put on there I won't say who's going to be hit him do we do have some startling I heard that you had the perfect face for radio so that's a fact I tell you with us while I was never a big on\nTV [laughter] they always\nThey always we run a net Godzilla movie this afternoon you will lose show your face when no that's all right well you seem to be a popular character a little bit earlier today when we had learned I was surprised that and I and it kept happening and especially can we tell their yeah\nI've got this thing on my phone I I think I've given it to a to a mad in the in the booth they're going to stick it in somewhere and whenever I get a message Donald Trump comes on and says I'm Donald Trump approve this message [laughter]\nWell we were at this uh what was what was the basis of ... of Republican made and we were there and we were we were gas and wherever they're sitting there somehow\nOr another you and I wound up on the very\nFront row yeah yeah and uh the lady of speaking had her back uh I have a back to her but we were turning around and uh they had everybody go around\nAnd say something about themselves kind of like ... ... and they got around to David and the lady actually into recognize usually this is my friend David Ernest ... and you told about the show when everything\nAnd then he got to meet you pointed to me and said this is rusty and I I made some remark in you know everybody kind of ha ha but then I'm sitting there and the lady starts to speak first off my phone rang and so I'm from around trying to get it turned off then like split second lighter who says\nI'm Donald Trump approve this message and everybody flies day was perfect timing right it was ... and I'm like oh man\n'cause I I didn't think about turning the dark thing off but we got that situation I was just thinking the Republican mating or something like that happened is Jill I'm Glad it was Donald Trump for come on I'm Martha Roby and [laughter] well hey you know she's never been to one of those meetings I don't think really an hour\nThat would look like that would be something that would be a good idea for you to go to he said if if you were a a a Republican uh\nType person ... to me as as\nBeing a politician I Do not understand that now but anyway what is your what is your financial ... and you know I you know Trump pro any you know ... or ... or anything but I Would think a lot of people it's not as good as they think\nWell your act cue there's nothing wrong with Iraq you know\nIf your average or you know what to call it when they measuring\nAccusation say anything between I think nine in a hundred and ten is nor is a ...\nSo that shows your ability supposedly to learn and to retain and stuff like that but if you if you can actually\nTrain yourself to make higher points only ... you can become a critical thinker you become a ... okay you can do the same thing about knowing about money you can up your ... you can become a money ...\n... and you have to have to teach\nTeachers are reading reading is a good thing but teachers teach you things to make you better be able to take the test better in other words the more the more the more schooling you have\nA ... like the ... say the more I they are man while I've been learning the law you know they the state of ... ... ... book learn much learn you know if you would just learn\nMore about this now there's two ways to do want us to read and one is to have a teacher ... are and there's a three way to do a combination of both\nAnd to not always always be open minded and to balance out the different things that you're hearing\nYou may hear something that says this you know we have done this and were were fantastic you know and then when they tried to put all these foot nose in there you'll see that some of the decades it might actually lost so much they were horrible cry you know see it always has to do with the long range stuff\nNot just short range you know I'm short range can come up with just like OK above above all team\nBall team could just come out and ... when the biggest game there ever was and then the other nine games in other words they beat maybe they'd be like to beat the one live as opposed to be the national championship does\nThat happen here [laughter] I Know that's what I'm thinking man you just don't know\nIf it ... the average is not\nThe episode ... stock market goes up one day and you made or you bought into one stock and he became a millionaire okay that's called luck and it's a it's just the extreme looked just like rolling the the lottery the dad they nice ride it can happen okay but if you want to be a\nConsistent consistent act cute genius\nAnd everybody can be if they try what you do you stay consistent with a plan you stay with a plan you know that old saying not everyone\nFails to not everyone plans to fail they failed appliance uh-huh\nAnd makes good sense yeah so failing to plan will cause you to fail because you have NO PLAN and you have NO PLAN you have no ambition you have no no reason to do anything because you don't know what you're doing because you haven't even try had\nYou're not doing anything and not doing anything that you know just usually causes no results so don't plan to file\nAnd plan to plan a plan I have had something to do this kind of went away their plan plan ahead if plan ahead planning ahead have a plan it needs to be written\nDown and you know a lot of people say we're writing down my wife's always say and do you remember this just write it down what are you know I use this little thing and bomb on my hand now that's how I I don't write things down a punch them in well you\nKnow in every pirate movie I've ever seen they're looking for treasure what am I got\nExactly that's it they got the map out there looking our goal over a year and a bias there and ... are and then they found the treasure\nSo the other day we were talking about treasury maps in the uh the the pirates were actually like the IRS and\nI you know there's a lot to be said about things that you've got to have a map\nIs treacherous territory out there you got to be able to to like you have a faster ship you have a quicker direct you know a ... a quicker\nWay to get somewhere via a or a better way to get somewhere or a safer way don't bring your ship around rocks and and and corals that could sink you\nWill not a hole in your home knock on your plan to stay away from it that's right if it's a hurricane out there don't come in where he can ... get out there and the wide open this get away from it now both for your own ship gifts to the rocks\nPick up the phone call David ... three three or four to seven or seven for three one he will get you Jim job done your remains those trend didn't get you back on the right course well\nLike I say this show is about financial IQ and finance your I. Q. can always be improved will say well I'm not too smart on that stuff but you know what\nNobody would be if they didn't know anything about it wouldn't matter if this is ... ... you could be a genius mechanically and no nothing absolutely nothing about investing money or about how to gain wealth\nYou know we had another show that said there's a thin line between being poor and being wealthy just like there's a thin line between love and hate it's such a thin line\nThat crossover is so easy\nAll you do is have a plan in steak consisted if you will get a plan and steak insist that you will be successful is ... is an avid will you just you can't even fail at this plan\nBecause you have a plan and it does work it's always worked and it always will work um if you\nAre planning to do something let's just say you were you you were trying to plan a dinner or what your plan trying to plan an event\nIf you put it together\nAnd everybody comes and they eat all that great food and all the ladies cook all the food and they put it all together it's wonderful event right right but if he said well I don't care who's just let's just get together we go to McDonalds or something like ... I don't know man I mean some of that that doesn't sound too good it doesn't really work out so well bilateral poll man's progressive dinner\n[laughter] you but I Am but if you're taking the money and you had bought the food and you had cooked it it would be the quality would\nBe much higher and I'm not knocking hamburgers I Know some people like oh yeah my dad loved his or like blink you'll know if I had ever had a child I Would have named him hamburgers [laughter] how much I like you wouldn't named him Libby\nWell it is possible I mean look they just prayed nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah field several\nPeople or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders for you know the vice president's et cetera uh of the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point and that's just my point you know I have reporters\nAll over the former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that they would do that\nAt this point in time but let me ask you this because getting getting back to this high enough treaty and you've written about it I agree with you wholeheartedly at the time has come for America to pull out of it um but ... has now turned around and said that that if the U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles\nIn central Europe he's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can elucidate us on that but what you know that he's going to target these countries\nI can talk so what does what does that mean\nAnd and how and and what you what does what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the IMF treaty pull out\nWell that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is he going to do except threatening you know the U.S in countries where we may deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles\nJust like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan with the person to is against the says twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so when he means by targeting is is really just putting the coordinate sort of Warsaw or you know are hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting a timeout pulls that carry this\nTime and this is so you're literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit is literally he's talking about about changing target coordinates\nOh for sure he he I mean what could I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all before then this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia can keep up with us economically especially under the Trump economy which\nIn two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and I noticed he went to the United nations and the you know tried to drum up support there to force us to not what you off and the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations that you know threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with and had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot uh he's\nAnd the Washington Times an arms race with Russia bring it on I think it'll go up on on more as a a Web site certainly will go up on the underlying or show page on Facebook so go and check that out there and explain to us a little bit about what ... dot com is because that's that's fascinating to me\nI Know I have a long history or in Russia studied it at the air force academy the language I you know learned about the Soviet Union flying for the air force I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realize that the west especially Americans and you know middle America don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI had built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell and the important point and and you and I own a lot of talk more about this because I was I was a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learn the language of you at the very least I Need to rush up on my Russian so I've I'm always looking for people to talk to us but the hottest show dog teams on a show\nSo much but my my question unlawfully people what they don't understand is it is that this is really it's not for ... and it's not about the reestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about ... the trappings of the Russian Empire\nAnd and uh you're exactly right and some things like me well thank you but you got a [laughter] I think it was supposed to be able to claim that a little bit explain explained what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks like\nWell I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the old one looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a Fort roost you can go to in San Francisco yeah it was just today as a monument\nAnd so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union was one of the most productive successful countries they said he's a really half the world with their economy and their agriculture\nAnd adjust now a hundred years later\nGot back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union said to them that destroyed them economically destroyed them politically culturally I mean what Russia last with the Soviet\nI'm a you know the ... revolution is just astounding and I would I Would I don't want to happen here so we had a lot about\nThat but I mean this is this is why this is changing stance\nVisa V. Russia is so important I mean the the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual\nThey the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strengths it's not quite that but the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I mean don't I mean that that's what makes\nWhat we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to do with my right\nOf course and as you want collusion them in the Bahamas or their their entire administration on down are the ones that clear to Russia and still probably are in some ways\nA ... you look at a uranium ... you know those sales you look at a what's going on with the Trump dossier cetera I mean there was the intricate interaction with the Russian security services by the bomb in his administration against a political candidate and and so\nIt's just amazing to me that people don't get that still they don't want to I guess\nTaught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good work they're doing it wasn't like get in touch with me when I Want to talk Russian when you\nWell I can always\nGo to ... dot com T.

I think there is that is the thing possible that's why this piece this morning and thank you very much tennis for the call 'em you know we've got the situation MSNBC has been calling this a suggestion to the mail bomb suspect reads the Drudge Report and Fox News Sunday on one of the earlier callers which was hinting at\nWhich is sort of these false flag operations I I'm Sorry I'm not going to call it that we step back I don't mean that in what I mean is that you have Democrats who will\nPerpetrate these kinds of crimes\nAs a way of raising the stink you know I'm a there was a a feminist activist in Wyoming or who had claimed that she was being threatened that turned out she was spending threatening emails to herself on the same thing happened just recently with another democratic activist a on a college campus\nUh you know at this issue of folks who claimed to put up I'm the founder of anti Semitic graffiti uh only to racist graffiti only to find out\nThat it was in fact done

to whom is there a benefit to this and I think you are you are correct in that regard I mean this is the again if it fits in with ... razor here\nI'm a you know the the simplest explanation is usually the correct one and I know I I've said that a couple of different times but I don't want to make sure that a hammer that point home so that we talk about these things um but that's also why I I Do think that we cannot discount\n... we cannot discount or that the Russians might be involved here in some way shape or form such as you want to have this conversation yesterday with a a Russia expert who who did tell me he did not think\nI did not think that the FSB the Russian foreign intelligence service was involved in this he did nevertheless say but on the other hand there is strong evidence to indicate\nThat those are not yet as you know the cameraman and his brother up as your car up in Boston that they may very well have been trained in influenced by the Russians\nThat they are all sorts of weird things that were going on with their radicalization\nAnd and that the way that they built this they're bomb pressure cooker bomb is not something that would have been readily available on the Internet\nAnd so uh that that I found fascinating there is a real benefit to\nA real benefit a continuing benefit to a lot of foreign powers or by this continued a discontent in a in the United states affect somebody tweeted it I don't have it in front of me you know or that the Russians would very much like Democrats in power I think that's true to an extent\nBut the what the Russians are

the first congressional district of South Carolina\nIt just it because it let's be brutally honest with everybody on on the right yeah Democrats don't have a platform to share not to say in the past Democrats haven't had something good but they don't have anything to talk about we should be focusing on the fact that we\nThe lowest them wind that amber and if people don't see that they I I just can't put my arms around it but I Believe that Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are toxic to this country\nThey are toxic they're all about the rhetoric they're all about the negativity in body in the exact opposite of what an American should they\nShould and proud and strong to gather as a country\nMy just inside my dose of South Carolina state representative Katie Arrington she's the Republican candidate for Congress in the first congressional district on and on that point you know nobody or it's obviously off the front pages today\nBut this was we got a the the third quarter GDP a measurements today we knew we were going to be getting those obviously nobody was talking about them or because of um [noise] uh uh because of the other things that are in the news this a fake bombs story a and and we now\nHave a a GDP at three point five percent of the third quarter\nA President Obama when he was an office said we were never going to see GDP above two percent\nOf the Trump a communist turning that around obviously this is very important to other folks are talking to the see this in terms of jobs and more money in their pockets how are they on those sort of uh the Trump tax and regulatory agenda one of those same to you about that\nOnly a lot more money in our pocket of the Trump the you know tax agenda is positive it's up to Congress to get tax to to auto path\nWe need to ensure that small businesses and the middle class get permanent tax relief absolutely paramount we have to do that that is that's going to be a huge focus on going into fashion but other than that when you know we're looking at the regulatory you know I have some big manufacturers in my area\nA bowling being one of them shore and they just four hundred new people that parents no one likes a tariff no one likes the tariff\nBut President Trump is standing firm and putting America First and that it's imperative we need to remember that this is the world's best negotiator let them and do his job you don't regulate it got\nNo no go ahead go ahead please reducing regulations\nAnd we're thinking well I ... to let businesses thrive is what we need to do I mean we ... government the fundamental belief and I'll get Senator Tom Davis and the state of South Carolina credit on 'cause he told me that's probably part of my ... a Democrat fundamentally believe government is to set up problem\nAnd Republican elite government is a problem and that is what Trump is doing the government's the problem is getting rid of it finally we got Congress working chili within on that and we have to keep them a mental going it is paramount as my\nMy colleague at the Competitive Enterprise Institute Wayne Cruz says you don't have to teach the grass how to grow you just have to remove your walk from your lawn and I think it's already been a little bit that sort of by one of my other Bailey works is is the is this issue of regulations but but you know and it's and it's interesting because you talk about this issue of negotiation and\nAnd and Trump um I I have a I had formulated a theory on what I call Trump's rules of acquisition I'm a star trek Duke uh this is a ... thing the ... and we'll number one is always be willing to walk away from the table\nRight ran over to is sometimes in order to demonstrate your opponent but you're willing to walk away from the table you have to walk away from the table and will number three is don't pre negotiate with yourself I mean this is\nThis is the great folly of a of a you know democratic negotiators trade negotiators over the years is that they've always pre negotiated individually inevitably sold out American interests and so you know I understand probably\nOr what have you but nevertheless it is going to go shooting tactic to pick the strongest position don't you think\nOh absolutely and we need to remind ourselves that that you know I look at what we're doing through right now it's like a child getting inoculated we know they're going to have a fever for a day it going to be a little bit cranky for a minute they're going to live a lifetime and never get sick\nWe have to prepare ourselves I mean this is it it it really

going to be our friends\nKnow that we have a president is going to stand tall against\nThem I just you know I was going to ask you about about how your constituencies are looking at this this\nBomb possibly but I really want to focus more on substance here I mean what about what is your what does your polling response when when he talks about do you mean he literally I'm assuming you know for

thing he he is\nRunning on a platform of I'm going to stop offshore drilling from South Carolina wow and I sit\nHere and well number one he doesn't understand the job of Congress that's not their job

four hundred a month\nAnd so it's like you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit a direction I have about two and a half years to go there we're going to retire from our jobs and laugh and Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family what we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\nThe camp will be a the\nThe operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that had his own\nOwn will be rented or own we currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on it at a\nTime and um\nI Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent for ... for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or which happens to be your non profit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk\nAbout what kind of a\nYou know\nYou need to get with the insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I Would be concerned about that if somebody fail and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the landlord or they could sell the tenant\nThey could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\nThings that they don't own you don't have an ... interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit or\nI Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do so well let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on their hands up the land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a and so treat the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get confidence insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying as a treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it or they might but you wouldn't want to buy their even if they did so instead you would go to insurance broker and they shot five different companies that ride airplane insurance\nWorks on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash wrote what happened in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs this much and this cover company covers the same stuff except that doesn't have that one thing and it caused this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins [noise] you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into the low a little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing you want is liability do do hold harmless agreements carry any weight in any of this um\n[noise] no uh ... yeah they carry weight but um\nHe in\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from ... you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was right and then one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless\nAs you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh and because we didn't properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign of Harlem farmers before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called ... those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk\nHarmless is it what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps people honest right it's like do you know you were you were walking across that employer you fell on your face 'cause you ...\nYou know and use on hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not have to write him a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh\nAnd it'd be proven that you are liable regardless of the hold harmless but I\nI Would have him sign them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to we're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and having attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are often Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still awful [laughter]\nThey'll still loose [laughter] so I mean ... they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you and I think for the Gulf and you're ... you're joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five at two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll talk AAA eight to five five\nTwo to five\nRight Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you know better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUm okay I have a Christian and I'm a new holiday or something that you've touched on our why\nI'm new to the ... and I know that number wine and the ads and dollar an American the fine my question is do you ever think jak aiming more than ...\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works in oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing\nBut I'm just wondering how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an honest stable environment where there's job is what you're saying and I agree with you OK but um that's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of gory but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\n[noise] um I don't it's never have only been working for three years ... never happened to act like it was never been laid off and that they get home pretty ... I mean within a couple of weeks\nI'm going to see a couple of weeks to do something and he is going to work\nOn something when he comes home if they did get laid off so uh\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed paws\nOne of the makeup of every step thing and there's pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about it as well we all have and that's why we get out of\n\n\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com\nIt's not dental insurance wander into as a dental discount program that functions like a membership club think of it like Costco you join for a small yearly fee and you say big every time you use it\nOn talking discounts on all procedures from routine cleaning to root canals in fact two of my team members of saved over a thousand dollars with the one dental plan\nHi Dave hey\nWell I was a one of your opinion on regards to um to whether it's just all my rental property to pay off my primary rap for them or ... any other debt also that I have a\nBunch of other debt if you've got\nTwo cars um I had credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the last I Would say three or four months\nOkay so your debt free but two cars and the two houses right okay how much do you own your cars\nI'm fifty thousand on bald each or total on both total\nOkay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty okay you know a lot of car and um so what do you own your primary and what do you owe on the rental\nMy primary I go to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\nMhm\nThan rental and now my my rental Ohio one in is worth about I wouldn't say or thirty ... but I met a little bit less\nOkay so I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right\n[noise] right\nAnd so on you know if we state taking say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental first probably go ahead and pay off the rental um my pal files first I don't know either one's fine but um you know he started going on forty fifty grand a year and that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh\nFour twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the year of paying off your car I'm ordering soul the rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had in classroom whether to to do that and in ... most of the party much do the rent on pay off pretty much all my dad on it but I also have in mind for that but I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in two years she's going to go to college I\nHave a house payment you can cash flow that right okay you know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore right now my credit cards are cut up there and then she told me get ready by a car\nYou pay cash for it I'm All right you never grow money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight up the planet to get on track\nYou know you can't sort or ride this out a dead horse it doesn't work\nSort of routed me got to ride him or not and so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental\nAnd pay off everything cash flow college and I would say about and bought me some other rentals with cash or go along out there into the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have\nAnd go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it\nYou got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle then yeah dumped the rental on pay off the cars and pay off the house um\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do\nYou need to be a hundred percent free a slap build your emergency fund and then start building George junior college fund and then once you got junior college covered um by just don't want to start in a savings account junior college junior dollar just throw it in their build it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then I'm\nA then once that's done then you just start saving up and paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way what we're working the baby steps here are the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the soil that run I Would I Love rental property but I Love being there for a more\nAnd so I don't borrow money in life is good when I don't have any payments any where life is good it's awesome\nI thanks for the call man or Russia you're joining U.S Open phones this hour as we talk about your life and your money it's a free golf the phone number is triple

I'm not exactly sure what the best thing to do if I'm not the beneficiary about it or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took the shot when your husband was a child yeah oh God\nThis is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it's quite a million dollars\nWow they should be canceled okay\nIf his whole life insurance policy about ... billion dollars is a very expensive\nRight and yeah and like my ... are you know we found out the beneficiary I don't I mean he's a great guy I'm not worried about you know that it down\nMy own guy doesn't matter if it's a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there was a very unlike occurring now I'm a wild one\nBut it's strange how long have you been married for a long you been married for five years and five years they've done address this issue as strange as it really\nI mean they should you should address the issue is that they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on a half a million dollar policy that's a whole lot policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a portrait of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\n\nSo if you just called me up and you just only about half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ... but you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance symbolizes proper on you and your husband and I think\nUh I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that like I don't want anything in pain or something that you know I mean I think you have a long time\nAnd it's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan a plan has now changed yep 'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nHow are you today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm a question uh regarding out part of my retirement savings sure comes a called a pinch him from my company [laughter]\nAnd that overall is about eight percent of my total as ... or ... or pension\nHow well it's I mean a ... it's projected to be or at a projected retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that that would be by eight percent of my code will have had you know and\nAnd my question is whether it be an as a lump sum yes or ... ... okay\nHere's why okay if you die or not we if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all going to die or get when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a ... and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it might it might go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefit the money's gone it's gone and if you live I or\nAs long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we've got an account for you over here two hundred and eighty five thousand you can invest it you can make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you could think that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can rolling into some mutual funds and a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal right\nYeah I just [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but uh\nIt's still you know if you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you do the same concept applies so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you\nDie makes this a bad deal\nAnd so you always take pension lumps on almost always type engine lumps arms and rolled 'em to IRAs and invest them and good gross stock mutual fund so it sounds like your net worth ... million\nUh yeah it's a closer to close that and that's probably about four oh well they're total total Matt where the assets house and so forth ...\nCongratulations [laughter] how old are you I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um\nProbably somewhere in a hurry to hoard hunger range from both my ah my family and my wife's family forty a millionaire or that was before that happened a\nMillionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when\nOf all a young popcorn time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\n[noise] a holding pattern or because of the amount of heritage is leaders maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nIt's it's almost irrelevant yeah OK cool as I'm ... I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell by twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means lives they got a modest lifestyle which we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I've done a stupid thing which I think if you can limit\nIs saying that that should do along the way that's good I like that\nBecause it makes every every everybody listening right now yeah he has done or will do stupid things I didn't you can minimize ... along the way\nAnd we have a modest lifestyle will blow your means I'm no more aid\nSo do you think you're going to be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if they're just listening to me right now\nBut he is probably a probably even higher if they stay minimized do stupid you know it maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and that sets up all the math on networks to your benefit a at a Wal alive as he put it in mutual funds and upon death for short\nYou come out three hundred grand to have a\nQuestion about it a thank you for

you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dog ... days\nTo hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates binding you it finds them for you\nSo what we're saying is is that you know that there's this houses really poorly managed\nDon't hardly anything [noise]\nYeah it it comes and goes there's been a couple of years where it was about seven hundred a month in ... but the last year I think it ...\nIf she's getting seven hundred a month off his house why isn't that covering her three hundred dollar shortfall\nIt was and it was building um that are checking

to live\nA well that was kind of in the plan which we could basically jumpstart through a baby step three and take the money put in some of the other money put it in the end or merged refund and then either rent for a short period of time while we built up more of a down payment or use the money and buy a smaller property\nI'm and smaller house um that uh that we can you know they will enjoy\nMhm ah ah [noise] um\n\nThere's nothing wrong with any of this equation um but I Will be a straight with you I I'm afraid I'm hearing something else that in order to be happy you have to make less money\nAnd that is not a script I Want to join in on\nA you can be happy and make more money\nAnd this idea that in order for your life to be good you have to take a dumbed down job and you're not living to your potential and I'm not suggesting you'd go back into a high stress situation but uh doing something you love you could make double what you're making now and it feels a little bit like your surrendering settling\nRemembering when\nCells of the nation and used on history wanted him to do or you\nKnow certainly thank you how can I help\n[noise] okay [noise] so I can find your plan for Arnold like a couple of months now I had the emergency find that I'm working on baby step too good on the night and I had made progress not a ton of ... it's on ...\nOn an issue is I give a chronic on that [noise] um I still work with her own I I'm not letting it killing our life good on my question is is how do I I check 'em for\nAnd I did Dr ball and I ended up recently I recently switched off ground summit festival started again I'm\nNot a chronic illness you're going to hit the ...\nRight I'm\nThe guy that thing on the go it it it's not they don't have and not life threatening are you going to double every year\nNow\nOkay so now I look at what what is the nature of this or what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail going on in that it's an error pain condition and the doctors are I'm sure I'm I'm I'm okay um so it was over there but I Want to do is I'm sure because it's relatively new got I got I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experience got to help you that you have with this the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing it what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in as a budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand or ... years and that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA\nA whatever a line in your budget for medical expands only going ... medical or just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money is set aside for that so that every 'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up\nAnd leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime\nOf this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean the issue is that I'm literally um like penny pinching [noise] I don't like the where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you like to hear right now on\nWhen I'm I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know pay out more so why are we planning\nAnd we're going to I had that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand island that\nI make I don't think a lot on the license social worker because at my condition actually switch to a job I had more flexibility on Sunday fee for service division as opposed to a salary position and then I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred Fifteen hundred ... a paycheck\nUm I knew that he drives a month on line\nYou back twice a month okay and you said you're living with a\nGuy gets them I'm living with a roommate I paying nine Seventy five around each of us a lot um and I do that from ... from ...\n... and what is the nature of the debt student loan\nDebt is everything credit card all also because they can handle it I was trying lot of holistic thing [laughter] I'm not at all and then it's you know most of it for him to check it out [laughter] I haven't the total effect speak out\nOkay so for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things and that's a food pantry\nNot eating not eating outside and you're paying more than half your life your lights and water and your rent and your transportation\nSo food shelter clothing and transportation utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson and listen to censor the necessities are only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you work as an end of the dead as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going to repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming\nYou're told me that that's why you're called yeah yeah yeah I mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying ... said I've got ... how do I prepare for it you save uncover it so\nNow that's our short term long term outgrown we got to get your income up and you're out go down and knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and as your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be\nPrepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but uh we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards is Tom for plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you [laughter] I'm doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nAll me and my wife I'm going through baby who right now I'm In fact we just stayed up art that getting credit card today though we are the only credit card movie on the line\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're working to babysit too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding\nI don't know if we want to ... and ... percent and um I ... that we were not in position media right now we're trying to pay all that we can get later\nOn on what I think what kind of a new model that I'm about an eighth of all I Want to get your input on a\nWe have our ten percent by it but we want to die without thinking about Clinton bought out and given back the church and then having that extra five percent and kind of giving it to\nUm other charitable organization that we believe in that are doing day or a ... you know ... ...\nYou know try to do what we can to people who need it um but if she's on the other hand want straight and pretend a church and then you are what we do what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she won't give her a church\nGot a big argument about I think there should I tell you what was it was on the\n... the definition of the time there's when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term in Jesus reaffirmed given the New Testament is tent they literally means chant the word means tamp\nIt doesn't mean that doesn't mean twenty if it means tamped down you can decide or the ... they're not you get to decide\n[noise] um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says and so what they rammed his opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker Lanny ... Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you\nI Love ya and um you can give are not given all still love you but the best way to live your life is to to give\nAnd all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed does in the New Testament as a tie the tens of urine from evangelicals have taught and believed for Fifteen hundred years that that private is your baseline minimum and giving and it comes off the top [noise] before you do anything else and he goes to your local church\nSo if you want to ... to answer your wife wins the argument that's the biblical argument but she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably true\n\nIn order to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nThey actually managed to make something that was already difficult to understand even more confusing\nIt's never been more vital to your business should consult with attacks professional to determine how the new tax law will affect your business employees and quarterly filings I'm Talking about consulting where they tax endorsed local provider here are some of the changes that affects your spending\nAnd a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income\n[noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one twenty year where did you used to my old job\nYeah that that's what I was making before uh before okay um what do you make now why\nNow I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June ... June was my first day and real estate [laughter] I've got to choose a house has sold six listings and extending clothing bought into uh the second week of November\nSo what is your projected income for a vote that's six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand by the end of the year\nAnd now what does your why didn't make of the one of\n... makes it the uh she made a fifty one dollars the\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you rent or make as much as you used to make\nYes okay good good news All right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out\nI'm only selling to houses that between that long it's been um [noise] and her thing is she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [noise]\nOkay that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for rich or poor in sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows said\nAnd so it you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape if you want to be married we are doing this together\nIn other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just give you can handle that cancer thing there by yourself and those troops that came out you get to do that by yourself and you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nOne were married in an instant sickness and health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a princess and be selfish that's not an option sorry\nAnd and um that's what I was trying to explain to her that we need it my my truck is for sale already I have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these cold in the courts will have if I can get what I was asking for which would when I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good\nI'm with these clothing and that's what I was trying to tell her to as\nI'll get a car cash and then she tells her car and then what have at least one corner [noise]\nBut that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're going to move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay off on other firing until now\nBut here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming should create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYeah and like I told her she she worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are any or clothing by the second week of November everything should be closed those\nMoments just two and three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her car today I Would show your trial today\nAnd I but I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ...\nI'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... that ship your room mates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that\nSo uh but uh but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth of debt making about a little over a hundred but instead it has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven thousand dollars for the ... a year for two years we can keep her car\nBut if you're not willing to do that as a household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble then you're not willing to join armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys you ever marriage problem [noise]\nBut hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit\nAround start selling mama's car is not weigh a good way to get ...\nHello so let's try that other approaches I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes right looks like your income is going to go\nThen you might be looking at a different career and he's going to be looking at us on our car and you get hurricane car to drive you drive a cheap car while we get this man is going to\nThis is the day Ramsey show\n\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing

large sized baby Ruth or whatever it is a good trick or treaters so I don't know any more [noise] uh All right\nSo in for George Nouri tonight who's getting a good weekend off I Hope and doing something fun and ... and in this period just before Halloween ... is our focus for both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night looking forward to a season with the which\nIt's a in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we had a great show but about witchcraft in Salem a couple of months ago but in this case uh we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween\nAnd some of the festivities it will be taking place and uh and then also the men from the train discovering Americans most elusive serial killer\nAbout the scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAnd also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James\nWho have some of the butter no as a sportswriter he writes a he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he was not in he's not in LA tonight\n... originally we had him scheduled a Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out he wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to finish in after all which is great because in the tradition of like [noise]\nYou know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff up it's a creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night on coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll tell you some of the subjects will get to\nIn the news segment in a minute but but by the way speaking of the world series I think we're competing against it right now we're still in in the late innings still tied up unless something changed uh it was a great game\n... and I don't want to accused Larry King of being a vampire you know I'm not saying leery of vampire [noise] but I was looking at him behind home plate and I'm just saying that um he\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world uh I tell for example the story of Ilan mosque\nOr being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got his finger in this whole neural net of business it says are really the new one of the new hot topics out their\nImagine a ... and ... and ... imagine this because we're already doing it with mice in in in the very near future um you know it it's pretty certain that we're going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net\nThink of it I think of it as a fisherman snatch so you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse\nAnd when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain\nAnd then kind of a integrates itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this neural net has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it and the idea is\nHonest to goodness mechanism by which we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that have on mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that's that's even better but one of the one of the things that you know a mosque as foreseen\nIs the day when when you went to use the one of these men are on that\nWe can actually surf the Internet\nWith our thoughts we don't need a ... or anything like that so I think that is the beginning of the ... of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts\nAre memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore once you have that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will or thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon is so you talk about the supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so easily easily a whole you know it's not just the ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic we can do about that tonight\n... will I I think that's the way to go not cryogenic cryogenic is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think these other technology is much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know ... and so and I'm not going to try and see what you said to me it's been a a I think it's fair to say and this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward is when we use terms like thinking about doing or\nYou know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we can do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say chili logically that's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because\nYou know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously\nThen we're often reminded that what starts off as a really good idea [laughter]\nCan go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\n... thank you thank you [laughter] absolutely oh no absolutely and and you're right there this book deals with\nWe're right at the cost in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes it in for some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies ... are are kind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it it you know it it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about ... I in the sky want you know in the sweet bind by one day now these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about\nHey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible [noise]\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have a ... that we are creating these are incredible robots artificial intelligence and we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is\nThe near future but it is it's it's enabling right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I'm reminded of the ... the ... song um which I I inevitably come back to an subjects like this\nSo the folly of men Godzilla and ... and the the the I think this is where and I'm sort of curious about your approach on this because this book is published by\nA publishing company which is known for being the based\nAnd ... and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can but because we should do and the arts are really important in there too so you know just because we're on the threshold of doing something on we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision\nOn the implications of when we decide yep this is where we're going with this\n[noise] yeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I have to give him credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you can\nUh reporting science all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you\nKnow opine about the threat\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that I described\nAll fact based in their ... it's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew ... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand what now if you can imagine\nOh no it's I I've read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so\nHere here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um\n[noise] I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are brilliant a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise]\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of\nCreating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an eight is in the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA\nWith the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA than on the Cornell where I got my PHD in physics math and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be and I explored Hindu wisdom and Buddhism and ...\nA Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter] and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it is so I became a man of faith faith I'm a Christian and I take my ... my face very very ...\nWho call upon the fruits of him in spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever you're fading [laughter] to me is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist that debate there are some innovation in the book\nThat I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff\nAnd that's where we go with the next in the classic study so much so that the pope rodent as he does get ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael Guillen list next on coast to coast am\nThat that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about [noise]\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like the weather that was through uploading brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something the you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate lets the end use for that um other than our own human vanity that we've become immortal [noise]\nYeah I agree with you and and uh I think that in another concern a in addition to that is that [noise]\nAnd about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive\nUm you know ... and never mind are trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let's let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to let's say\nA I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going to just take that as an example there is such a good way in California right there's a company in California that is a marketing a retinal implants are people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff cause you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so a lot of the technology that that is aimed at improving our how Hansing our health and hence you know live achieving their mortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people elite\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put on a business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about in science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the years well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now\nIs for people who have been kind of disenfranchised\nUm are marginalized by this technology will just get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking it and we're taking it as a behind and and and and and we're not going to we're not gonna take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ... do you talk like that to the people in jail um no I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta be really on a limb there you know and [laughter]\nWell I figured it's a late night shows\nSo you're not going to lay down on now I Know it's\nLate but you know never mind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know hit ties at the white you said what a bus or [laughter] but um but I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually\nAre buying these what they're calling book out houses rent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nThe chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again only this stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I caught some I quote former Google engineers in a Google executives are and and others\nWho say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay been hanging on may ... lives in ... ... ... because he is the idea of having a bug out house right\nYeah that's like I mean every ... every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has a has that philosophy\nRight it was ... to ... and yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that belief that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point I\nI'm thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance\nRight they're done they they they they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce sane\nIs and the and the notion to that for example when you talk about the ... the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the morals that leads anyway we could you know a ... quantify society\nIt's the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them\nAnd then if that becomes the ... the class that's perpetuated I Would say again they had their chance this it has\nTo there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else is going to have to come along behind them or we turn into a lawyer and more locks from H. G. wells time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no it it it's interesting I by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside when in fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and\nI had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere in the ... at the after party and Jeff bloom was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to I said Jeff you know you're always like playing a scientist\nOr not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said\nI I'm just curious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up or what he does not just a job and you know he has the housing is appointed in his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in physics at college and now you know [laughter] but no job for him\nYeah it's interesting I I ... I Love you bringing that up in the dinosaurs had their chance [noise] it's really an indication of how the earth how the world works how the universe works\nAre designed during work\nIs designed to work exactly yeah and you know a a you know you're somebody's religious beliefs aside for a moment let's just talk like strict the science sir I'm ... what what were you learn is that\nUh the species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's the media or whether it's a temperature change or or it's a rampant disease that ... that I mean you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on\nAnd the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder\nAre we doing here and then I think of what Arthur C Clark one set and it stuck with me he said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I go oh why oh\nYou know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by a half\nWith a staff thinking that you know we're going to improve why they were gonna improve the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves in I mean that's a real possibility and and and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some\nSome creature and the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance now he blew it\nUp and here's an inch now let me bring up a little differently yeah there was an ... humans killed off species they didn't die out naturally they were killed off as opposed to say\nEvolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow their evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by\nIn bird and New Zealand lead these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so to me there's going to so I mean I I realize you can make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some there are some tiger or whatever that if we cloned that barren brought it back and reentered introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed that it couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles\nUm but I Do think when we start\nLooking into the future and then we start making all these plans of who's going to beat and who's going to not be that's when I think again super well to use the words in your book ominous but I think it goes ... becomes downright scary because who is going to be making these decisions once that technology becomes more facile\n[noise] yeah yeah you're you're you're raising a good point you know I Do talk about these the extinction efforts that are going on right now I'm at ... primarily focused on the woolly mammoth\nHow they'd been voted best dry clear in Montgomery year after year\nVisit them too good at one twenty five brown springs road Seventy eight twenty five bong road\nOr online at birth cleaners dot\nWhen it's worth it choose ...\n\nChevrolet Master control so this is W.

things that are coming from the frontiers of science and in a couple of things you want to keep an eye on I'm saying about you [noise]\nUh and uh and it will be the end of life as we know that life will carry on but what will it be like we'll talk more about that just admitted also will bring you in on the conversation at\nUm who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached to\nA just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins and the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nBy that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been coated frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic ah you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nAnd there are scientists who are uh her quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so we're at once again you know rumor\nI'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart transplant\nSure you remember that a Jobbik are here he um what was his name Jobbik writer yeah something\nLike that and um everybody cringe to oh my God way way putting that Mitch mechanical hard in a human being and the you know it was in South Africa right and\nYou are ... and ... and ... and and you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing\nAlthough now you know with stem cell research and other things going on um we're even getting past mechanical hearts hey by the way in a you talk about things that\nGive me some pause here's one there are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota yeah I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but okay there you are [laughter]\nI Know that the minute University of Minnesota's ... does he has a huge research you it's a it's an hour one it's a big school\nNo you're right you're right I just I just I don't know why\nTroops to scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called ... shape human and take him in ... so these are creatures whose DNA has been it together using human DNA and sheep DNA or human DNA pig DNA\nAnd they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human heart for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom\nAh but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I discuss the book that if you put too much human DNA into the recipe and it was it's always a question too much human DNA too\nLittle human DNA then you don't get the human organs right if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain\nTrapped inside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now because of our ability to tamper with DNA um so that's one of the things that gives me it gives me a little bit like the we really want to do this and what's interesting is that these guys are doing it\nAnd by the way I quote one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility that this is not like\nYou know made up ... pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this possibility but they're doing this research against the wishes of the NIH the national institutes of health which is the government's never one funny body for biological genetic engineering so even the end I H is kind of very um [noise]\nYeah you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just push the pause button and decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines for the guard rails\nAre all I'm sure I'm sure these guys are no just doing it in violation of the ancient probably doing it against the advice of their moms [laughter] yeah yeah they don't\nMind the oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then ...\nThe town over and I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found my mom's kitchen and I look back and I'm Out there in the garage at the ... of our [laughter] making hydrogen gas\nAnd you know that stuff is explosive and I ... I Would filled balloons up with it and then send little insects law just to see what happens that's a ... I was a little mad scientists and they're in\nYour own space program again in her will right by the way\nGuys but they can marry you're right the mothers and say why don't you know I get All right doing that already go play tiddlywinks there's something safer\nMentioned LA as you mentioned earlier when you mentioned that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA you kidding me know so I didn't know they didn't they name\nFifteens inning game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like singing a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz he said to kind of works and so I don't know I I guess\nI guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors because that's how that's how it's happening right now still there's two men on top of the fifteenth and we're we'll keep an eye on it so sorry to ... this is the island of Dr Morrow things pretty scary it really is but I\nI I still you know none of these ... would have the technology that people use\nWell you know we're series you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look on a window Siri is it snowing\nYou know or you know Google ... by ... by me some more uh ten meet whatever and these commercials and everybody's focused on that type of business and I kind of get it but they were just beginning to learn the down side of having\nA microphone connected\nUm and on monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things to worry about and that's the other thing we're bringing about ourselves okay I'm\n... and you're absolutely right I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas\nWho use the Amazon Echo and you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by the way you know this a doll house the fancy fancy dollhouse and parents are totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak out\nBut here's the punch line in he would think that the parents will have learned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know get rid of it uh but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around Alexa now are you\nKidding me [laughter] why take away having leaders are oh yeah I Know\nIt's so big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story\nAnd ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and death now I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really it really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter\nMay be in there in the Saudi consulate they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor it that way but however it happened that kind of the debt that passive\nListening that is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our ... a country I've just had an op ed that it'll be published very shortly I'm a U.S a Congress issued a report on Thursday so saying that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nThey were then you know is that kind of a refrigerator dishwasher everything that's going to\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now I'm more than a billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to ... to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show the thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nAnd I think that there was an intruder and now the only man who killed he killed his wife and the basement and the police started looking at things and they found she was wearing it why\nOh yeah no I was telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed a one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fitbit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet chi walk and it didn't square with the story from the hospital\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things\nThat are fine on every aspects of our life they can tell you when your sleep when you're awake how many feet you are\nWhat your heart rate uh you know it if you watch Netflix the the the they they download what you're watching when out for how long I mean there ... this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited it on our fellow then we're buying these gadgets\nYeah and I like a lot of them I mean I were in ... by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the fitbit in ...\nTook it from the real life\nOh they do maybe they are they always do no ripped from today's headlines to pay a but that's where I mean I think that\nThey like to catch a killer is one thing when people listen they go oh good they kind of killer because of the ... the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection systems\nWhich accidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime\nI mean that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having the humongous database of face prince\nRight or that they mentioned covering the ... yeah and and and and they have like a eighty they they allow themselves on eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent\nInaccuracy race with which raises the possibility that you and I can have the FBI knocking on our door is because they think we committed a crime based on their database but the facial recognition technology that they're using\nTo id and could finger culprits is wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere\nAre saying it's it's more than twenty percent and so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people are going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA McGill in the end of life as we know it let's get two key who's in Virginia and coast to coast am Keith\nHow long can you hear me in perfectly good a night on my own turned back up\nThere you go and you know the question from Michael\nYes Michael and I argue or speaking about the ah Jarvis cart have a couple of friends one of which I wouldn't be a great guess because of his favorite experience\nAnd service even there's a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but uh it'd be great to have them on to tell a story\nAbout a lot of things [noise] um one of the um [noise] predecessors that artificial heart was a a\nHeart open heart honestly that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling mail from a\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that the sharp a cart was at the University of Utah\nAnd I'm ... years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgery at some paranormal experience is one of which was a\nWhere he did a surgery but a technique that they'd never been done before and he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically for the first ... or whatever it was\n... right in his mind any of that the surgery\nA from those instructions but he was I was in his mind and later I\nGot to get to a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so do you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like that but did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm I'm a male and by the way is\nGoing to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to that because I knew there were ... we had our time is precious and I open lines is where that kind of belong so let me go to Tracy who is\nAnd Tracy\nMichael I got one question for you here where does it and where did you stop when do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we as a good question but are we playing God yet and when do we played God is maybe is another question but Michael [noise]\nWell I think that is the ultimate question that Tracey is asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president and he said now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I hold him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but he was when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who's in the thick of it and this this is directly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that\nIn effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about\nAnd and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with a dynamite you know you pick your you you pick your image imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you're going to have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics\nBut all it takes is one thinker and that can really within rice that but it was everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God premise are we playing God or aren't we would we cure a disease if the disease is natural was as God made it natural and the earth is hurricanes\nAre we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know it's a popular phrase phrase right and\nThat's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really encompass all the ways in which\nYou know when we make a better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but it was really a matter of playing God I think it is more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplants I I mean that can be said we're playing ... so what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on fire oh totally\nI was I was the first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil fill a oh a oil fields that were on fire and the way I\nHave to get there was through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the a Saudi Arabian oil company he knew way through the mind feels and so that's how I I think of trace this question is\nI see as their icy as navigating a mine field and you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one line that's going to do it in\nThat is unsettling and outright dangerous nevermind a great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine I if I say all it takes for\nUs to do is to step on that one mind that one hit in mind and it's just going to blow us up\nOkay Mississippi thing I think that will be the end if it comes that way but no I did\nOkay so you're the scientist you're the you're the you got the PHD in physics [noise] let me just\nGive you what I think is a better metaphor though for a for a science and this is is we had to get you had you know let's say the the goal is the other side of that minefield [noise]\nWell you just simply going to have to say there are going to be X number of scientists are going to have to run through that minefield and enough scientist run through the minefield

it's if it's just a a machine you know complicated hammer um it would have no soul that it could occupy but then again you talked to other people who say that a inanimate objects you know become the

you pardon the expression I think we all you know lost her breath over that we just just just cut us off guard [laughter] so yeah and I'm Sorry and I I Know that I think I think he had any

never did that start track down a\nNap and get paid to do and I if if if you're a kid they were like oh my God is that\nWell it's nice to chat with you I tell me real quickly uh so what kind of ... what station did your father worked for a\nWhile he ... and pat eight eight\nThan they were aware of how\nI Know I think you so much information that I Would like to I was like to hear I think you do

the news is really no their stuff [laughter]\nIt's really cool they could just builds the not enough and\nI'm All right so that brings me to keep from Virginia is back\nSo key had called the um when we were talking with our guest last hour and it seemed much more appropriate to have him on here for open line so I'm Glad you called back heat so you you had a friend who was you were telling the story about how the surgeon had essentially experience to kind of\nAlmost like a scientific revolution but it came into almost sort of divinely\nDelivered where he suddenly knew exactly what to do in this complicated surgery do I get that right\nOh that's correct because I understand that and um\nThen individual by the way and and ah thanks for having it back on and sorry for not\nIn a little bit quicker and smarter with everything but um somebody very topic for eight to ... and and that related to some of the things I wanted to say too but I'm sure this gentleman Dr wrestling now and\nUh also had a a he relates the experience of a failure a twice in surgery which his patients died\nAnd they were children and they later many years later a visited him from the spirit world\nAnd delivered a message for him to give to\nTheir parents and so anyway this individual by the way is the same time I'm now from that in at the age of Ninety three after having been on a possible for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having left his world renowned medical career I\nBecame the careers of a church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three and a an amazing man even a damn downhill skier at that age\nAnd um [noise] anyhow um what I Want to\nFor a couple of things regarding astronomy and some other things and which\nIs revealed by the judge gave a little bit more and hiding from ... on your things on the coast am that there can be perhaps a connecting in ... in the lame about normal and things from traditional Judeo Christian\nTeaching a we find them and also in the Bible\nAnd and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph revealed or I'd have to reveal to how much should say by a Jesus Christ and many other officers that he had a profit\nAnd he brought about a lot of new\nScripture H in scripture as well as new scripture [noise] you know and and get about thirty more seconds here so go ahead I said\nBasically to wrap it up the eternal manners one concept that he spoke about any caught about\nI wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by Truman Napster and there's a very good Youtube video Joseph Smith and the recovery of eternal man because a lot of the responsible thing to\nThem ... by you know the the church from the council on some of the scriptures for the last ... where the base of the creek\nWill have to leave that for [noise] a LDS scholars to sort out um [noise] but that's interesting and I I I have a lot of friends around the U.S so [noise] that'll be conversation over an iced tea coming up\nMarriage have little caffeine and so uh coming up next our methods of books are next half hour or more open line calls will give you all the numbers you need to take his wherever you want to take is coming up next on goes to goes to am this is the\nAnyone at all the pairs correctly in in the in the jar container so they're all\nFishing out towards out\nOr whether they come and get there they were just out of their own fan right there\nYet but the thing is that the moving of the I mean it really is it's an amazing video in it for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it um but the scissors in depends who the ... in this little cup holder whose district moving around\nAnd it's just it's not I mean you could almost making an argument like maybe the jar\nWas on its slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh but I don't get the thing with the the pencils and the than the scissors so benevolent pulled her guy so I'll go with that until it got\nAny of that theory to a a back in a ... show is in Wyoming and coast to coast Michelle\nOh wow Hi Stacy and I'm Sorry I'm a truck driver and I like all\nThe first things first things first thing I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that'd be easier\nI Know I can talk right now for a second look at it and take on I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have you what I was wondering why it's like I was raised as a Catholic and then like I chose to kind of walk away from that and explore other\nOptions and other things out there because you know I just I don't know that that we had help inside an when methane gas Michael I'm close to the when he first got on he was talking about that you know that scientific side of him and and\nThe lady that lady\nTold them to read the Bible and now he changed his mind on it and it's a Christian saw what I was wondering and\nI don't know how well very strong religious stuff exactly but I'm a little bit like I ... I Wonder how often when I'm driving down the road and how we can trust\nThe authenticity of the Bible because you know I've often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the story of the ... and the story of um [noise] you know like\nI said you're a hero type figure being one of a virgin and stuff those stories can be found in like pre biblical tax you know like ... ... talk for like ... and ... you know whatever predates the Bible so\nYou're talking about\nYou're talking about ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels in the in the guild diminish narrative to the news story [noise]\nUm and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of men God or ... that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is just another version of that\nSo the question to me always is not this to me\nAnd this is where I think a lot of it in my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up because I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the Bible because of how many trees it has in it\n[noise] okay there's a there's a difference\nTo me and there are ... that we know to be a worse steering by right there there you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good do you you still have to be good to them because it only makes us\nAnd a lot of these stories tell these cruise the actual facts of these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest\nThey'll let you know story that can be found in other places we can still try as saying like the other information on the ... well no\nHere I Would say though is that even some of those other stories there are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who when Christianity was catching on\nOver two thousand years ago or the other people started in like I'm emphasizing something from their tradition saying see were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote\nThe things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof about that there isn't that in the Egyptians there's there's a little bit of a tradition to that but but ... in the end does it matter I mean ... it's do you can you do live your life better\nIt doesn't improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science blood people treat it like it's supposed to be a science book and it's not I don't think [noise] um and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to re learn from them every day\nHow do you think of that that's my best answer for you open it gives you something to to

somebody is um\nThat logically advanced than the mind and have the means to do a lot pretty impactful when he says things about like a a guy and a five medical augmentation and stuff\nAnd uh I really thought it was a neat metaphor they use than how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around you know we have the ability then massive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want\nAnd all that and he said that you know in the very\nNear future that could possibly be the thing that we could do hands free\nYou know and uh\nYou know what would that do maybe to the educational system would we go to school will be just take a loss of classes to learn how to think properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those but I think we need

I'm burning treatment that idea so they'll have to wait maybe tomorrow night if I could figure out something between no tomorrow night\nOr I Will and I appreciate that and I'll get to it and if I Do going to be in the first hour tomorrow night an otherwise I'm not sure it will be back on again and Thanksgiving so it may have to wait a while but let me see what I Do but they use really it's really very interesting let me go to\nKaren who is in Alaska on coast to coast am Karen\nHi um this link and when she was just saying and it certainly ties in with last night there was some gas and I'm In the show was short um first of all I wanted to say you are by far my favorite of ours and has to gorge but you seem to be afraid of controversial subject\nThough because they love it [laughter]\nSo you know politically correct oh we can't talk about it or they just\nYou know I I I guess it's funny 'cause I I should listen to more maybe I'm I'm Out of step maybe I should be more like you know you you're not used to say that oh no trail\nWhat what I wanted to change the subject to in like I said it may go along with what she was saying\nAnd I'll tell you a few things and I'll get off the air and everybody else and put in a sense where I'm been Mandela Effect first of all\nYou've probably heard about it there yet not knowing the memory to yeah will laugh about all these things called memory\nLabor in the world were members of one way and then suddenly it's not and and last night the example they gave was um I Believe it was I they are living in the Bible the wolf and the lamb versus the way we grew up hearing about the lion and the lamb\nBut a couple of other examples and and it's in any Bible and you're confined except guess what I got a catalog in the mail today\nAnd somebody had a prayer 'cause he was saying last night they had also changed the Lord's Prayer and maybe 'cause the catalog print like by this I don't know for over ... remember what it was but anyway it was the way we remembered it\nSo Luke I Am your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father um the things that have changed life was like a box of chocolate you watched that movie now Forrest Gump life is like a box of chocolate\nSally Field you remember when she really liked me you like me or anything right now they're saying if you watch it now says she says you really liked me now okay that's\nWhen\n... when she was hanging encyclopedia\nHow you have a couple of paragraphs about Jesus and pages and pages them all on that last night and I agree with this it's like a credit ... I've been doing the research for a couple year and a half maybe so they've been saying that there may be that there they said something about their goal was to make a\nI don't know Cornel and to another dimension or anything ...\nPanic rituals outside that place I'm and I'm Wondering if maybe that's why they're diminishing he's has now and and ... as we all know what he does you know that things he believes in any way\nThe other things we sent me to do be there'll be a victim of the Mandela Effect well even as you're talking about it because it will nightmares more ah\nBut here's a here's what I Want to here's what I'm proposing the the ... the thing I mentioned to you about Islam and about ... about uh Mohammed is that what we often do and I think you're you're getting into this and this is a completely fair point is that we we rely on other people to give us our memory\nAnd so we think we heard something we think we remember it away and to hear somebody else and then somehow we insert their memory in two hours and and and whenever we may have held we might have originally thought of the line the way it was ... you know but then more people repeat it\nAnd that's the only way that you you know that that they can hear it so I think the Mandela Effect is very interesting I think it's compelling I'm Sorry I missed the show we brought a great examples I Will say when it comes to Bible translation just remember this\nIt he can't do a perfect translation\nInto English from Hebrew and Greek ... from that era Hebrew enough that Eric Greek\nIt's impossible to do a perfect translation there will always be changed\nAnd some of them are just as simple ones some of them are just you know pronouns in people insert the name of the person that was talking because it's easier to follow the story but you are changing it you know just by dropping a permanent and putting a person's name in but others are much trickier because there are verbs that literally don't exist anymore\nAnd so we have to find just quibbling form facing was a verb for a long time I am facing\nAnd we just don't use that terminology so you know the fact that the translations keep changing that's great that's the way to beat up and I hope not for politically correct purposes but because it's just a matter of getting it\nCorrect which I think is more interesting All right so let me go to a ... a Marty who is in Tulsa and the time we have left on goes to goes to a a Marty\nIn a corner as you're I'm honored uh first I've ever tried to call and the coast to coast I've been listening and like others for years and years I had to hit the readout about fourteen times that I was surprised to be able to get on\nThe right [noise] I had a and it's\nNice by the way to hear your back on coast once in a while I thought you had disappeared forever so\nI [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nWell they needed year [noise] hey I'm In uh discussing a with a couple a gentleman earlier about the Bible\nAbout thirty minutes ago or so you talked about how genes or um is depicted as being murdered and the ... but not in the Bible and I think I'm a seminary student I'm a minister I studied and a couple of different Bible college's and ah [noise]\nIt says very clearly and scripture that she and her um no one could take his life he said that he laid it down we're fully he later down voluntarily\nMirren schemes Adams drugs you can find that at the intersection of front\n[noise]\nChevrolet Master control so this is W.

do the whole\nThe whole old intro tonight I'll just say reading to Mr and Mrs middle America and all the ships at sea\nCoast to coast am with Ian pointed to the to the to the hospital alien armies floating silently behind their cloaking device you just outside of earth's atmosphere remembered eat the Canadians first [noise]\nIt's a special Halloween treat really because they're like the size\nOf candy bars when you knock on the doors are rich people's houses that was that the Americans were like fun sorry you don't do that for the large size baby Ruth or whatever it is I Know a good trick or treaters\nSo I don't know any more [noise] uh All right\nSo in for George Nouri tonight who's a getting a good weekend off I Hope and doing something fun and ... and in this period just before Halloween that is our focus for both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night looking forward to a season with the which\nIt's a in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we had a great show but about witchcraft in Salem a couple of months ago but in this case\nUh we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities it will be taking place and uh and then also the men from the train discovering Americans most elusive serial killer\nAbout the scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAlso happens to be a written by a guy named\nBill James\n... some of the butter no as a sportswriter he writes a he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he was not\nIn not in LA tonight\nWe originally we had um scheduled a Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out he wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to fit in after all which is great because in the tradition of like\nYou know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff up it's creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night on coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll tell you that you're still with the subject we'll get to\nIn the news segment in a minute but but by the way speaking of the world series I think we're competing against it right now we're still in in the late innings still tied up unless something changed uh it was a great game\nAnd I don't wanna accused Larry King of being a vampire you know I'm not saying Larry King the vampire [noise] but I was looking at him behind home plate and I'm just saying this um he may not be a vampire\nWe're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but but how realistic is it ever in the near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else [noise]\nI think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Ilan mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nGot his finger in this whole neural net\nA business it says are really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine this because we're already doing it with mice and in in in the very near future um you know it it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this joined jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it think of it as a fisherman it's not so you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse and when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped\nItself around the brain and then kind of a integrate itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this neural net has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it and the idea is that now we\nMechanism by which we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that have on mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection\nThat's that's even better but one of the one of the things that you know on mosque is for seeing\nIs the day when when you went to use the one of these narrow math\nWe can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a ... or anything like that so I think that is the beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore\nOnce you had that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon is so you talk about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so easily easily or hold you know it's not just for ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then\nAs I say robots are becoming very realistic we can talk about that tonight we will I I think that's the way to go not cryogenic thing ... is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think these other technology is much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and pursue what you said to me it's been a a I think it's fair to say and this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward is when we use terms like thinking about doing or\nYou know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when they see the future because what we can do now is the frontier\nBut that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically that's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously then we're often reminded that what starts off as a really good idea [laughter]\nCouldn't go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\n... thank you thank you [laughter] absolutely oh no absolutely and and you're right there this book deals with\nWe're right at the cost in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes it in for some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies ... are are kind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it it you know it it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about pie in the sky one you know the sweet bind by one day now these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about\nHey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible [noise]\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have a ... they we are creating these incredible robots artificial intelligence than we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing\nIs the near future but it is it's it's enabling right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I'm reminded of the\nOf the ... song um which I I inevitably come back to an subjects like this\nYou know men Godzilla and ... and the the the I think this is where and I'm sort of curious about your approaching this because this book is published by\nA publishing company which is known for being the beast\nAnd and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can but because we should do and the arts are really important in there too so you know just because we're on the threshold of doing something on we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision\nOn the implications of when we decide yep this is where we're going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I have to give them credited with their idea um and you know they said basically he you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you can uh reporting science all your life and\nI've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this but\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know uh I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that I describe\nOur perfect based in their ... it's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew ... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot now if you can imagine\nOh no it's I mean I've read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough\nThorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so\nHere here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um\nI see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are brilliant a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise]\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating\nFor ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an aid is in the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be and I explored Hindu wisdom and Buddhism and ...\nA Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter] and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I have become a man of faith faith I'm a Christian and I take my see my face very very seriously\nCall upon the fruits of him in spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist that debate there are some innovations in this book\nThat I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff\nThat that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life but on this planet is like whether that was through uploading brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something that you know even that it makes me\nA question whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate what's the end use for that um other than our own human vanity that we've become immortal\n[noise] yeah I agree with you in and I think than another concern a in addition to that is that a lot of the technology that\nThe longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive\nUm you know ... and never mind are trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let's let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to let's say\nA I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going to just pick that as an example there's hardly in California right there's a company in California that is a marketing a retinal implants are people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policies so a lot of this technology that that aims at improving our hell Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving their mortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from the ... and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about in science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the years well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now is for people who have been kind of disenfranchised\nUm are marginalized by this technology will just get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking it and we're taking it as a behind and and and and and we're not going to we're not going to take it anymore and so and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ... do you talk like that to the people in Salem no use that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta be really on a limb there you know [laughter]\nSo I figured it's a late night shows\nSo I Try and she's going to lay down on now I Know it's\nLate but you know never mind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know his ties to head the white you said was a bus or [laughter] but um but I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually\nAre buying these or what they're calling book out houses\nRent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world on the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again or one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I Hope some I quote former Google engineers and a Google executives are and and others\nWho say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay ... ... ... lives in ... which ... percent because the idea of having a bug house right\nYeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has a has that philosophy\nRight it was ... to ... and yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that believes that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point I\nI'm more thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had\nTheir chance right they're done they they ... they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs\nAnd the notion to that for example when you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the morals that leads any way we could you know a quantify society it's the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except\nInheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them and then if that becomes the ... the class that's perpetuated\nI Would say again they had their chance this it has\nTo there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else who's going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from H. G. wells time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no it it it's interesting I by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside when in fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and\nI had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere in the ... the after party and Jeff bloom was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always like playing a scientist\nOr not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I show\nI I'm just curious has said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up or what he says not just a job and you know he has the housing is appointed in his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in physics at college and now you know [laughter] but no job for him but\nYeah it's in ... I ... I Love you bringing that up in the dinosaurs had their chance [noise] it's really an indication of how the earth how the world works how the universe works\nAre designed during work\nIs designed to work exactly yeah and you know a a you know you're with somebody is religious belief ride for a moment let's just talk like strictly science um ... what what we learn is that\nUh these species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's the media or whether it's a a temperature change or or it's a rampant disease that didn't that I'm In you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on\nAnd the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder\nWhy are we doing here and then I think of what Arthur C Clark one set and it back with me he said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\nAnd you got a minute\nOh you know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by half\nWith a staff thinking that you know we're going to improve life the we're going to improve the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves then I mean that's a real possibility\nAnd and and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance now he blew it\nUp and here's an edge now let me bring up a little differently\nYeah there was a ... humans killed off species\nThey didn't die out naturally they were killed off as opposed to say evolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow the evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by you know\nBird and New Zealand lead these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so to me you know there's going to so I mean I I realize you can make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some there are some tiger whenever that if we cloned that barren brought it back and reentered introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed that it couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles\nUm but I Do think when we start\nLooking into the future and then we started making all these plans of who's going to be and who's going to not be that's when I think again super well to use the words in your book ominous but I think it goes ... becomes downright scary because who is going to be making these decisions once that technology becomes more facile\n[noise] yeah yeah you're you're you're raising a good point you know I Do talk about these the extinction effort for the going on right now I'm at ... primarily focused on the woolly mammoth\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center and this is W.

even getting past mechanical hearts hey by the way in a you talk about things that\nGive me some pause here's one there are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota and I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but okay there you are\nNo you know the ... University of Minnesota's ... does he has a huge research you it's a it's an hour one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just I just I don't know why it just gives me an article\nBut anyway you have three groups of scientists\nWho are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called ... shape human and pick human ... so these are creatures whose DNA has been knit together using human DNA and she'd be in a or human DNA pig DNA\nAnd they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom ah but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I discuss the book that\nIf you put too much human DNA into the recipe and it was always a question too much human DNA to little human DNA then you don't get the human Oregon's right if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain\nTrapped inside of a body of a sheep or pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now because of our ability to tamper with DNA\nUm so that's one of the things that gives me it gives me a little bit like the we really want to do this and what's interesting is that these guys are doing it\nAnd by the way I quote one of the researchers and says yeah that's that's a real possibility so this is not like\nYou know made up ... pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this is a possibility\nBut they're doing this research against the wishes of the NIH the national institutes of health which is the government's number one funny body for biological genetic engineering so even the end I H is kind of very um [noise] ah you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just push the pause button\nAnd decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines\nFor the guard rails are long ...\nYou're probably doing it against the advice of their moms like what are you yeah yeah they don't\nMind the oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then ... the town over and I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found my mom's kitchen and I look back and I'm Out there in the garage at the ... of our [laughter]\nMaking hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive and I don't believe I Would filled balloons up with it and then send little insects are locked just to see what happens ethic\nI was raised in a little mad scientists and they're in\nYour own space program against their will right by the way\nGuys that they can marry you're right the mothers I say why don't you know I get I stopped doing that already go smoke quite deadly waiting for something safer\nMentioned LA or as you mentioned LA I Want to mention that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA you kidding me know so I didn't know they didn't they name\nFifteens in a game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like singing a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz he said the kind of works and so I don't know I guess it\nI guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors for because that's how that's how it's happening right now still there's two men on and the top of the fifteenth and we're we'll keep an eye on it so sorry to ... the the island of Dr Morrow things pretty scary it really is but\nI still you know then he would have the technology that people do you see all the commercials for which I'm\nYou know we're Siri you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look out a window Siri is it snowing\nYou know or you know Google ... by ... by me more uh ten meet whatever and these commercials or the N everybody's focused on that type of assist and I kinda get it but they were just beginning to learn the down side of having a microphone\nConnected um and on monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things to worry about and that's the other thing we're bringing about ourselves okay you know I'm ... and you're absolutely right I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas\nWho use the Amazon Echo and you know and said hey Alexa buy me a\nBunch of cookies hey Alexa by the way you know there's a dollhouse fancy fancy dollhouse and parents are totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak\nBut here's the punch line and he\nWould think that the parents will have learned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know get rid of it uh but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ... and now are you\nKidding me by that take away I mean you know who you are oh yeah I Know\nIt's so big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story\nAnd ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael Gil in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch that they were able to monitor his apple watch and ...\nIs that I don't know that it really it really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter maybe there in the Saudi consulate they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor it that way but however it happened that kind of the debt that has to be listening\nThat is going on that we had not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our country I just had an op ed that it'll be published very shortly\nI'm a U.S a Congress issued a report on Thursday who are saying that\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities that something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about the videos that kind of a\n... year treasury rate or your dishwasher everything that's going to get\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches as smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now I'm more than eight\nBillion Internet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to bug us to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you talk about the show the thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe situation and the husband was cleaning one thing he said there was an intruder and now the man\nWho killed he killed his wife and the basement and the police started looking at things and they found she was wearing a it it was\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a the these women wearing a fit but it's one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walked\nAnd it didn't square with the story from the hospital\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things\nThat are spying on every aspects of our lives they can tell you when you're asleep when you're awake how many feet you are\nWhat your heart rate uh you know if you watch Netflix the the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean there ... this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited on ourselves then we're well these gadgets\nYeah and I like to do a lot of them I mean I were in ... by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the fitbit in a ... a law and order episode last week the exact same thing\nThey took it from the real life oh they do maybe they are they always do no ripped from today's headlines so he uh but that's where\nI mean I I think that they like to catch a killer is one thing when people listen to go oh good they kind of killer because of the ... the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection systems which\nAccidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime I mean that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test\nOf this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having the humongous database of face prince right of the\nSafest you're covering\nThe ... yeah and and and and they have like a eighty they they allow themselves on eighty percent accuracy rate so the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent\nInaccuracy roadways which raises the possibility that you and I can have the FBI knocking on our door is because they think we committed a crime based on their database but the facial recognition technology that they're using\nTo id and could finger culprits is wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent\nAnd so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people\nAre going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA McGill in the end of life as we know it let's go to Keith who's in Virginia and coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me a perfectly\nGood a night on my own turned back up\nTo go and get a question from Michael Michael and I heard you were speaking about the\nA friend one of which I Would be a great guess because of his very experience\nAnd service even there's a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but uh it'd be great to have them on to tell a story about a lot of things I'm One of the predecessors of artificial heart was a a\nHeart open heart honestly that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson or worked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that the sharper cart was at the University of Utah and I'm Thirty years earlier and he\nAnd his career as a heart surgeon and some paranormal experience is one of which was a\nWhere he did a surgery but a technique that had never been done before\nAnd he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically it's ... or whatever it was ... right in his mind and he did the surgery\nA from those instructions said he was able to see him his mind and later\nI got to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so do you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like that but did you have a question from Michael\nAnd that could be yeah I'm I'm a male and by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to it because I knew there were ... we had our time is pressures in an open lines is where that kind of blog\nSo let me go to Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\nMichael I got one question for you here where does it end where did you just stop when do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we that's a good question I mean are we playing God yet and when do we play God is maybe is another question but Michael [noise]\nWell I think that is the ultimate question that trace he's asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project I'm sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs said now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I hold him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but he was when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who's in the thick of it and this this is directly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that\nIn effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about\nAnd and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with\nA dynamite you know you pick your you you pick ... imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhenever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you can have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics\nBut all it takes is one thinker and that can really within right\nTwo of the playing God premise are we playing God or are we would we cure a disease if the disease is natural it was as God made it natural and the earth is hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know a popular choice for a ...\nThat's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really encompass all the ways in which\nYou know when we make a better break pad or who do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but it was really a matter of playing God I I think it's true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplant\nOr I mean that can be said we're playing ... so what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story\nYou remember when they lift the oil fields on fire oh totally I Would I Would vie for television corresponded to actually find my way to those oil you know a ... a a oil fields that were on fire and the way I\nHad to get their way through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the a Saudi Arabian oil company\nHe knew way through the mind feels and so that's how I I think of traces question is\nI see as their icy as navigating a mine field and you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one line that's going to do it then\nBut as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous nevermind a great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine I as I say all it takes for us to do with the step on that one of mine that one hit and mine\nAnd it's just going to blow us up ... thing I think that will be the end if it\nHad to come that way uh no I did\nOkay so you're the scientists you're the you're the you got the PHD in physics [noise] let me just give you would I think is a better metaphor though for for a science and this is is we had to get you had you know let's say that the goal is the other side of that minefield [noise]\nWell you just simply going to have to say there are going to be X number of scientists are going to have to run through that minefield and it was enough scientist runs with a minefield the goal will be achieved [noise]\nThings do you know why we're getting applications from jugglers tightrope walkers\nI

tell them a lot of things are changing here as the winter weather comes in and one thing I've seen around the\nThe the subdivisions right now our tree removal companies doing is still out there but be sure a few tears on some of those right now you need to be sure you got one that's slicing and insured be sure because that that's a\nThat's a tough job like if you get the wrong person up they're cutting the tree down it falls on your house a lot of\nDamage is done who pays for it also one of the things you need to look for is after the tree is cut down ... somewhere in the clause is just that they will ... a ground stumped for you but you don't have to have an extra hundred or two hundred dollar charge for that there's a lot of the biggest misleading things right there\nWill tell them why they want to make sure that their license insured\nYes because you know that happens in your insurance company doesn't cover\nWell that's the problem if they get hurt and they don't have insurance and they're on your property then they're going to go to your insurance company\nAnd you got to go I yeah\nI never understood why if you hire somebody and this guy's working for this company you hired he doesn't have insurance and something happens to his worker then you're responsible ... why is that if he was on his job with his employer why am I responsible for that it just makes no sense to me\nThat's true and why is it if you're going to visit a neighbor's house and you walk across somebody's yard trip and fall and fall\nI mean it's I don't shouldn't have been in their yard I tried but I don't know if that's the lawyer side to make money or an insurance I wouldn't be 'cause they don't lose money mhm but I'm a I'm that's a good\nQuestion and he is going back to what Bob he's talking about the ... uh you don't want to hire somebody who is not licensed and insured because you don't want any tree to fall on some structure property and then go oops and hop in the trucking in here and\nMake that cut cut cut and they thought it was supposed to follow this way and it falls on a neighbor's car\nI mean I had an eight hundred a ... even worse than that some of them had been cutting trees down here in this uh you know these are some of this weather here lately here and it's been hitting the power lines it when that here there's a lot more a lot more houses without electricity that's your fault and pays for it or they're not sure about who pays for the damage there\nYeah it was a Saturday about seven months ago uh we'd finished house dug side been back home and my wife and I had had a little lunch\nAnd the power went out beautiful sunny day or what happened then I look out and now do you have underground utilities certainly yes of Oman neighborhoods a little bit older and we [noise]\nSo you got me now yeah okay and\nI look out and the power lines are just shaky and I'm like okay maybe that's one of the ... ... ... email look down the street then neighbor was cutting a tree and then fell on the power lines that luckily it didn't bring 'em down but it made a made the break or throw somewhere but they had found fix\nWell and that's I take that back mad at my house are to how these two houses the one next door to us was added after the subdivision was developed so yes we have above ground lines but I see a lot of new subdivisions which I think is very smart\nAnd it's all underground and then he comes into your house in ... and now we have cold weather or actually ice or freezing or somebody ms cuts they're not fall over power and so I think that's over the years you'll probably see that get better and better and that\nKind of a ... so that's what you always hear when there's like an ice storm coming somewhere dry in in the you know all the power lines and the trees are going to vote he was\nA rural don't drive over don't try to step over don't go around that don't go near it just like you don't go near the water over the road because we don't get swept away\nSo I you know and also another thing that is when you're cutting trees down I have a professional to you know\nBe sure that they know exactly what you're doing because think about it a lot of these trees they ... they won't cut down right after big hurricane storm and the trees are when when they when the weight of them is like three or four times the original wait to watch out I said\nHey what about the guy I've seen so many what America's funniest videos or they cut it then they go I got is going to go right way to look at all of a sudden has gone the opposite way they're running into this crashes the houses are of car or you know are actually hit some people I mean\nThey have you seen those laws are there on the ladder and they're cutting the branch and it cuts and the hits and then it flips and knocks the latter down and I mean you know it's I don't know I'm too old for all that now\nYeah but you like to look at the video how do you know I mean you go there's some things you say about those people\nAnd when somebody is holding the branch down the guys cutting it then it Pam it's ... it's not so I don't know just be careful out there are professional\nThat's probably the best thing you can do I mean if you're handy thing go for it but you know the best players just hire somebody who is license and insured and they can take care of it for you and you don't have to worry about it all you have these right to check their ego Bob here\nOkay that's the thing in the news like I mentioned at the top of the hour was apples streaming TV

and how you got interested in um a wellness aspects of so or [noise]\n... oh well about forty years ago my uh my father and a number of other individual bomb found a number of silver mine and my family card produced and silver way back that\nThen what happened was the price of silver dropped so low we couldn't sell it at a profit and to what happened was that\nMy father said you know we need to do something much better with the help we need to look at what product we could make that would do good for often also helps people have said there's more than ... eighty products better at clear products that are all based on building\nAnd uh well we ... we turned it into a huge body of silver had the cat and why we found was that there were a lot of product that were made a silver and most of the more I ... and ... the eye on it formed ... they were not very stable\nAnd we actually went on a big crusade that they couldn't make an eye on a form of silver stable and what happened over time was bad\nI'm through our study and through all of our experimentation we thought that we had created a an eye for the silver that was very people that could be used in a lot of golf\nWe found out later with bad we'd actually be the new nana article silver bad multiple ... incredibly able it needs to be the ad in the other products\nAnd we were able to pat and that's formed the turnover because

find all the different uses for that all types of technology\nComputers all types of electronics there's all types of needs for silver in industry but when it comes to health care um\nWe can reflect on history ... over two thousand years ago had silver applications and the old saying being born with a silver spoon in your mouth had a\nRecognition as a silver has some ...\nTo it and it says some of our silver that still so today is based on some of these very ancient technologies are very very expired patent power\nAnd so you came across a in in your research that there were some side effects

do good or you may know about that book and like I Know quite a bit about that but [laughter] and uh it's you know\nLet's just refresh some of the the the kind of the mistakes of the buying public to make when they just go into anywhere that might look like a health food store\nDrug store and say I heard something about silver liquid or colloidal and I want to get a bottle of wine with the buyer needed to know a about a making a purchase [noise]\nWhat was the real big deal is that most companies really have no work on the product\nYou don't know where you're catty and anything with silver and water and that is down ... silk\nAnd some are like thousands ... parts per million some can be like two hundred and fifty million until you understand the different let me let me give you the one on one on it okay they're basically three forms of silver that are on the market one is called ... silver\nI Am a forms assume or what they are is the single silver ion Adam\nAnd they're missing that electrons and they want it back\nOnce they get found electron they're happy but there are no more use like a single shot\nAnd so I on a formula for you have to think about things they'll show they were but they don't work very well\nNow I Am it forms a silver not very stable\nAnd say what they do is they find it to a protein to keep it in their pension meaning keep it from falling out into the bottom of the bottle\nAnd so some companies find it to protein that's kind of like ... your grandma make jello or jealous and write or jam they put a protein in there which keep\nThe ah [noise] keeps all love the Jews as an day and keeps they've turned gum bat boy and that's kind of what they do and it's called a silver proud to be able to tell those pretty easy because the scope of proteins there about\nTwo hundred and fifty five hundred parts per million and they pay their battered because they have more over\nWhat the answer is they're not actually better because protein ... about their ability to function\nAnd so what you have the only partially functional things chat and because of that they put a huge amount as silver in there like two hundred and fifty to five hundred part per million out those are both on a form as a single shot it will work but it just doesn't work that wow\nBut we've created like I said by accident ... I guess was the nanoparticle and this particle is covered with the skin on the outside is the most they balance of rock that ... what's that mean is that and that is the only one electronic ours was to eight\nAnd then it pulls those into the core and they can feel a more and then eight more and then a more to what happened is Glen Bell slugging machine gun where everybody has the English that not only that you have to take into consideration the safety by now\nBut you get metabolized in your body because there are chemical foreign ... happens is they can actually stay in your body to ... a week or month\nOn the nano silver though we use goes then does the chopping washers right out in fact we have the only human ingestion says he's been the history of the world and why we prove those that are now and I'm Still bridge eastern ... were washed out of your body completely in twenty four hours\nAnd that's where you want you wanted to go in to his job and wash right out and ... or so we have to prove that ours was incredibly more on the fact that didn't know he talked a little earlier about a product called it'll be the only thing that is the number one burned cream in hospitals on the market\nAs white creamy stopping it has like ten thousand part per million silver\nAnd we decided that we would make a prescription product that people could use that would be a lot safer a lot more effective and you know better but in order to get in Munich Clarence on that we had to go head to head with a with a drug products that are already the ... and we think it'll be\nThe one we did was we took thirty two parts per million of our ...\nSilver jail and we put it up again ten thousand parts per million of the a bill that interesting thing that happened was that in the past we pick

on the counter and he took unprotected ... put it out money to put the males count and they started some silver into the mouth\nAbout two weeks later this science fair project one of them started just

cameras than our focus always workplace in workforce trends and this week we take a little bit of a different path\nAnd I want you to listen to what's going on here we've had some changes for the past six months we've focused on the trends that are shaping the work place in the workforce however\nDue to a number of request there have been a questions of how your places\nAre actually reacting to the trend so this week we began that exploration and it was a fantastic question\nCame they send you talk about the trends I'd like to know how the workplaces are reacting to the trans let's find some business owners and business leaders and talk about what they're doing and that's where we'll go and I'll give me a little bit more information momentarily of what we're going to get into here\nBut the focus of today's conversation listening closely is beer beer you heard me correctly and the state of the beer world I guess for lack of a better term in the year twenty Eighteen\nWe're going to look at how the millennial generation this generation born roughly between the IRS Nineteen eighty in two thousand are shaping\nThe beer industry today and how local distributors are having to react to those demands we're going to look at challenges in hiring and how one particular local distributor\nIs recruiting for people in places that I hadn't ever thought that they would\nAnd we're going to talk about how believe it or not I didn't know this\nInfluential the weather is into the sales now I assume on a pretty Saturday you're going to sell more beer but I didn't know how much difference it was so we're going to look at specifically\nA one business place and their reaction to the trends that are shaping the workplace and the marketplace\nAnd we're going to talk to a buddy of mine\nThis is Chris Chris is third generation uh owner of Budweiser Bush distributing in Mobile Alabama and Chris is dealing with these challenges up front and personal I mean it's it's his world day in and day out is how to move more safely to the right people of course\nAnd deal with this changing in the workplace and in the marketplace so you're interested in how the millennial generation is shaping the beer industry you're interesting and where it's going perhaps where it's coming from you're interested in where the good old fashioned Budweiser drinker may be\nChrist is going to give us some insight and that and I want to hear your thoughts and expressions in your ideas about the changing brewery world changing world of beer at two five one to six eighty one hundred [noise]\nTell us what you've seen what you think about it and again to five on Tuesday so any one hundred and that's both the phone and the tax law\nThat be in you know become a mean across so many different uh uh so many different platforms and it just it helps make the brand relevant and when the brand Israel is and it's healthy and when the brand is healthy hopefully we can sell more of it do do is do we believe increase Bud Light so you'll uh\nHadn't yet uh [laughter]\nEverybody [laughter] [laughter]\nBut but what it what it has done is it's it's ah like I said it's made the brand relevant brand relevancy you know and and and all sorts of different marketing is important especially in beer um so it it uh it hasn't turned the brand from negative to positive um but it has certainly\nImproves the trend and it's important in a consumer brand or your third generation and the first generation if I recall you told me in the past came here from St Louis is that right\nThat's exactly right Nineteen sixty five my grandfather worked for standard oil up in a St Louis and had they had to that this market had come available and sold everything he had and barred everything he could come down here and start this\nBusiness what is the third generation do new well usually were the ones that screw it up\nBread [laughter] first generation plans to treat the second generation ... grows the tree and the third generation sits in the old Chinese added knowing you you're not going to happen\nWell let's hope not a of a up and running this place for I guess seven eight years and I haven't managed to screw it up yet as hard as that try to um [noise]\nYou will um ... you know\nWorking for a family business um I I I Would say it's a different thing but it's the only thing I Know so it's not different for me but it is something that I take pride in and I do\nUm\nYou know I ... I Do feel um a certain degree of responsibility to um to work and try to do as best as I can for my family it's a there's a a pressure I don't know what the world would be it's just a a level of responsibility that exists and I I Try to live up to it\nHow involved ... of the end of the third generation or the first and second generation is still around\nFirst is passed away a the second generation are um here an active usually there's an indirect correlation between how well or poorly things are going and how much or little involvement there as from the second I've noticed I noticed that I Would advocate [laughter]\nKid or a no you know I Am\nI work with a a bunch of family members I've got\nUm an uncle who was still involved an aunt who is still involved my father is still involved um they're they're not they're not clock and then eight to five but they're here a whole lot and and um you know we we also worked with three of my cousins who are also the third generation\nUm and it's a it's a special thing it's a special thing to be able to come to work with people that you love\nAnd also being able to get along with them to the point that we still have Christmas and Easter together um so that's a that's a big deal for us\nUm the the family dynamic is fantastic or is that the case with most beer distributorship sort of they mostly family companies are you guys unique in the industry\nNow again most mostly they are um you know every every state is different and how they regulate a the sale and distribution of the product\nUm that was you know mandated by Congress and the twenty First Amendment when they repealed prohibition thankfully and I'm\nSo every state has different in some states uh for example the brewers can be distributors in Alabama that's not the case so in Alabama all of the ... is our family owned\nBusinesses um and yeah from what I Know they're all pretty regular folks and and uh and get along pretty well\nSo I was one of the questions are hand for you in so much of our society today in the business world the middleman\nIs being cut out Amazon shipping directly to the customer or something like that there's not a distributor [noise] uh I work with the product or a our office supply company out of a Chicago and their finger as being cut out because people are getting all these bulk office supplies directly from Amazon or from Office Depot\nFrom what you said in the state of Alabama the beer brewer will never be able to sell directly to the news or is that correct\nWell you never say never and and there are slight differences but I'm In in in our state\nUm the supplier may not also beat the distributor [noise] um there's a separation\nOf the tears in our business there are three tiered supplier distributor retailer and for the most part those are separated\nUm [noise] you know it it it uh it was\nOnly business to defend the constitution and not only in there once but twice or we tournament state or the national alcoholic beverage is the ... the industry\nSo it's into the the constitution as the Eighteenth amendment which are all edition and then the twenty first which were appealed it and the twenty first said that each state has the ability to regulate this product as they see fit because people in Nevada think differently about alcohol than people it out\nLen Arkansas eccentric cetera so they there's all sorts of different rules there's this patchwork of of different rules and regulations and [noise]\nYou know one of the things that that does grant to us or a ... it it has been a major part of and I always tell people said look at the difference between the Coca Cola aisle or the cola aisle\nAnd the beer aisle if there is a forty foot soda ... you've got twenty feet of coke and Nineteen feed a Pepsi and then one feed of some odd finance everything else right in the beer aisle\nYou have a whole bunch of baby and Beth and you have a whole bunch of Miller corps but then you have just massive amount of space for these hundreds of independent brewers that are out there\nAnd you know as a distributor who couldn't go out where we serve as a funnel if you will you know we're up to about forty two suppliers right now we have somewhere in the neighborhood of three hundred and brands you know imagine that each one of those forty two suppliers that we service as well as the probably more like Seventy or eighty my competitor does\nNeeds to take a truck each week to each one of those retailers that would sort of serve as a mess so the the function that the distributor serves is an important one not just for things like tax collection and\nProviding a real clear I'm I'm I'm an avenue for transparency with a product like this\nUm but you know also it's just a a very practical real we play as well\nSo you know as Bush out of St Louis a nail owned by the adventures we'd building our Brazilian Brazilian Brazilian group\n... do you call Budweiser booster Germany company are also delivering competitive products all these micro Bruce yes how do they feel about that\nThey ah you know they are in the process of of in building their own portfolio right there they're going out and purchase and a lot of these Kraft products like you mentioned the craft a space has been very active and has been an incredible source of energy in our industry\nUm and so they're enhancing their own portfolio a so that they can turn around and said to us the distributor hey you sell our stuff still sell this cell that right [noise]\nBut uh we are a completely Independent Business and are are the name of our business happens to be Budweiser Bush distributing\nUm and and we are mainly ... house but um we are completely independent from and has a ... then and um take not only other beer slash ... products to market but\nWinds and water and energy drinks and just about anything we can fit on the truck anything that's a truck carrying new willing to bring it to the retailer and that's even better believe in heaven wheels will come to you so is that the way it's going is that the future I think so\nI think so you know I'm a B or as a part of the overhaul alcoholic a market is is losing share but he is chair of throws chair stomach\nOr whatever you want to call it to spirits and ah and wine um that's been a trend over the last several years there's a whole bunch of different reasons for it the the boomers are getting older\nAnd drinking less beer and and move and the less carbonated products like wine and whiskey and um and these millennials you know these these kids are coming up and these are the group that uh that grew up having forty two flavors like eight or a there used to having the ability to pick their own individual flavor\nAnd spirits give them you know what unlimited liability of course to make whatever in the world flavor they're looking for\nYeah to some of those other products\nSo there's one way to say we're in the heyday of beer with so many options available there's another way maybe from the Budweiser point of view we're no longer in the heyday of beer due to so many options being available\nYeah it's it's well you know another thing you asked that question to start off about what what has made or what what has changed in this business untapped it to ten years the amount of ... ... s K is just um individual items that we sell guy rocketed\nYou know whatever it in the world it might be yeah so do they take the beer by the way you know in my experience\nThere's a there's two types of beer is your favorite near freezing [laughter]\nThe millennials you mentioned the millennials huge market ... number ... ...

percent or eighty percent or more are\nDenied the asylum claims that they ... percent so [noise]\nIn in in very short explanation is that a lot of these people do not have\nThe the um the case for asylum be approved at the end of the process\nAnd irrationally enough the a lot of folks\nThere was some it was over two thousand basically have turned around and going back home another two thousand Thirteen hundred thousand or seeking asylum in Mexico\nWhich is kind of an interesting proposition and then maybe they can try to come over some future point all of the people that are being

are to be honest I mean because uh it seems like central and south Americans are getting preference over Mexicans so we solve the Mexican illegal immigration issue we give a favoritism to Central American issues as all things factor two thousand two thousand nine guys your hands are tied innocent process just every time\nWe have a a a situation where we catch and release that involved is that population that demographic to continue growing and growing I Will tell you that because of the practice or where we do not have the ability to return these people to their home countries that\nHas instigated the caravan to an extent people do not believe that we will return them back and we have to absolutely returning back um if they come this way and illegally and for the United states\nAnd Japanese and when you look at the crowd here at four and five ten twelve pounds more than that and it's like a carrot and we don't know at this point exactly when the Pentagon has are going to send troops down I'm sure it helpful but not enough\nWe as we're seeing actually were seen about two thousand ah apprehensive\nDay right now without a care of and then my sector alone yesterday um or or the day before yesterday we apprehended well over a hundred people and\nAveraging very high numbers that without the or the caravan so as a camera and starts moving in and we're already are preparing for we're planning with our inner agency partners with the local leaders was non government organizations we will manage the situation the key is that we are\nWe have to be able to return these people home or if we do not do that we will see more carbons\nAre going to think about those two thousand a day that's fourteen thousand a week at sixteen thousand a month\nAs senator and twenty thousand a year but instead of the constant which it does it because of the seasons and whether you play in a in an ... type seasons that\nAre out there that is a bunch I had no clue that was to coming over that

are being taken advantage of it has absolutely sickening decision to the last part of this\nMr pretty isn't the problem really is a law that I mean if you want to change the way it is Congress and kind of do which Republicans in Congress age and look we've been trying to get something done while we've been trying to get some Democrats involve any simply will not change the law with absolutely\nWe have to give the men and women are the border patrol the tools that they need those two tools are are very simple one is we have to lose a cozy immigration loopholes in order to be able to process these people and return them home but the second one is of course the or the personnel the technology and the infrastructure to include the wall system\nIn areas where we need them um wages are working twenty four hours a day doing the best that they can but at the end of the day we need those two things\nPrice to the caravan is a ... problem but there is a quiet problem to deal with every day eight hundred to a thousand apprehensions and some of them walk right up to you in turn themselves in and they're part of the process and the ones that can't get processed get an ankle bracelet which they break off\nAnd they never show up again it's a cycle that you're seeing a daily basis and it's up to Washington to fix it can only do so much\n... that is exactly what's happening\nI Wish I could go in that I'm back I\nKnow I Wish people would just do the right thing really is and I hope the state or above a good cause I Believe the Senate could change and such a way that some of the people like Jeff Flake and John McCain not being there will be a good thing\nThat those two were is a a a border posts say basically they wanted a big open border out there and so

... often told her from by the people 'cause right next thing is I'm so glad that the last caller brought out a history of Jeff Sessions commenting on this because this is not far from the Russia investigation and he will be all over it\nYeah so you know if I hang tight balance you know don't rush to judgment on is this a pack bar where they may I think that what we really need to look all falling as if we see the uh the Democrat starting to retreat and they're gonna come up with something else you need to get rid of it [noise]\nI think that maybe the FBI move too fast for the Democrats liking if everything turned out the way it as being in some of the reports are coming out [noise]\nWell is this is actually ceased to before we so coming into the phone call I appreciate you as soon as he just came on board\nAnd Joey thanks for everything you do for us to hear it all I don't take me a mess I'm On the phone by um anytime anyone who sees the bomb of any kind I Do not take any time

so\nI Am not I think Brian because of the timeline from discovery up each individual bombing the location in the pool and Puerto is doesn't buy [noise]\nOne of those who\nWell for some reason they

bank in order to re energize democratic by it had to have bumps in the ... and I am Barney Frank that\nI originally thought this might be a a crazy is pony stuff out here\nPeople and [noise] I find it on a Trump order but this guy in the end and they all off off by by by our picture that we have not shown yet and I oh gosh\nThat is completely thoroughly investigated I've talked to finish and Bob fame twenty four hours with this\nCurrent the hour a crazy a ranch possibly mentally ill guy I'm short\nGift ... whichever one night I\nFound a a dot com and they're having their sourcing info from NBC News washing the examiner\nAnd this is some loose background information on say Iraq um according to a promoter named Tony valid died who talked to Washington Examiner accused the dream of becoming a professional wrestler\nIndeed found work as a professional stripper instead he found it\nBack in the nineties according to Tony Valentine event promoter circles running around the country taking jobs as a male stripper Valentine hired him for some stripping jobs in Ohio's a setup worked in Minnesota the Carolinas Florida quote he really couldn't find his niche in life and I guess he found a dial\nA Valentine told the Washington Examiner\nThen sex cousin apparently talked to NBC News\nWho said he couldn't go took too many steroids in this day he's always been a little bit of a loose cannon he's always been a wall soul Sunni steroids in a state of ... your brain that goes into it and they said it does just some background information now people are already system through linked in pages\nI'm seeing a photo of say a word to make America great\nAgain hat at the inauguration\nRed Bull looks like um [noise]\nYeah it's it's all coming out pretty quickly but to me it looks like he was a registered Republican that's what it's linked in page says to me it was so full term support him and you have ... let me go to a break get back to the ... thing and they went back\nOkay so let's say by today you let's say he loses ... and they say hey when as you and find out from this take care of this could be big 'cause he he gets down there it wouldn't work should it was Israel\nTell me if I got this right you are working to help Israel\nPrior to President Trump running for office to help Israel or do the best they can with his new oil discovery and you hook them up ... creek officials have tried to get a buyer for their oil and be able to actually write to energy that would have put a red flag up to the Obama administration they didn't like him doing that [noise] that's\nRight I mean there's this misunderstanding that I was a sort of about Russia Insider I have absolutely no contact whatsoever in Russia I've never been to Russia I have no Russian friends um but I had a lot of contacts in the middle east and Israel and Egypt\nAnd what I really think this is all about as there was some sort of red flags that the Obama administration and possibly his D. O. J. pulled on me for my contacts in Israel if it was politically motivated I'm not sure it seems like that now given a certain information I learned\nRecently but uh that's really what this is all about\nSo wouldn't motion it on as Israel oh so you know who had a lecture and that was out of there\nWe can keep on going down here now is gonna be talking about that but to\nSome extent but apple is get the attention of Donald Trump an easy answer to his foreign policy Tina unpaid position we didn't use missiles and hopefully get a job if he wins as fresh use asylum David Cameron rips Donald Trump to write an editorial saying it's unfair to do that and all of a sudden the antennas go up with British Intelligence am I correct\nAbsolutely as soon as I gave this it was an interview to the times of London I think a\nAround me first or second of two thousand six ten or ... told the u._k. prime minister look back off from the candidate that I'm supporting any shouldn't be calling him an idiot or whatever he was doing about a Kennedy Trump's proposal for a Muslim ban which I think many people at the time in the United states were supportive of\nAnd as soon as I gave that interview that's one of my life completely turned upside down I was being followed in London\nI had a officials from the U.S embassy which are seemingly use or intelligence officials reaching out to me Eli center down or want it to me and it was at that meeting with Alexander down or were essentially he told me do better stopped bothering David camera and then you better tell trying to stop bothering them to think about this Jewish\nEmbed the Australian and bass it or who by the way gave millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation is telling you to stop bothering the camera and here in American who happens to be working\nTo book proud that you were talking a guy name when states ...\nUm she always says miss it so it looks as I I I think it's I Need to clarify who this person Joseph ... for the audience so he reached out to Joseph enough so that was the professor for small teams professor who dropped the information on me about the Russians have any Hillary Clinton's emails\nHe was the one that a draw up the the thing about him on the Russia has he didn't ask for it I just mentioned the\nTitle Bob ... is the way he's describing it is and this is true is is ...\nIs a huge just continue on with the professor against his opponents who was working poor [noise]\nTo find that when you start to for what reason he wanted to talk to you about energy\nOf a sudden we meet in Rome and I never quite understood exactly why I was meeting this person at a this University in Rome through my old company which I found out is this sort of a western intelligence up front of ... pay which I didn't know at the time\nSo the entire meeting with Joseph Smith said from beginning to an seems completely orchestrated and the most important fact\nHas just a couple of days ago this man's lawyer one public unstated listen everyone this narrative about my clients to submit that is completely wrong is not a Russian agent targeting Papadopoulos he was actually working at the behest of the FBI\nWhen he was talking with Papadopoulos when he was interacting with Papadopoulos now unless his lawyer is slandering his clients\nAnd he's a waiting a massive lawsuit for libel I'm not sure that his wife got\nKilled civilians comes up to you and he says I hear these Russians have Hillary Clinton's email FEMA Simpson okay Allentown comes up a few days later and said you won't even know about Hillary Clinton's emails\nThat that's allegedly what happened I I don't remember ever talking ... about emails but let's assume that's what happened at this meeting it seems completely a suspicious that a week or so after chose service or drop us information on me alone Felicity unsolicited than Alexander donor apparently\nWants to figure out info on this particular topic it just seems that there was some sort of a sting operation are gone bad to be quite honest with you worry\nIs down or tape that conversation down or all of a sudden feels motivated in July of twenty ... twenty sixteen to call the in the eye and say I'm really concerned I end this conversation with George Papadopoulos and they say really some of these time following us our question to you the FBI questions you and what time they say you lied to us [noise] uh\nYeah so I didn't actually my first interview with FBI until January twenty Seventeen so it makes no sense of Alexander donor had this information about me that I was some sort of a Russian conspiracy person why was I interviewed only in January of two thousand Seventeen when I met Alexander down in May of two thousand six ten and makes absolutely no sense\nOkay so ... and he had interviewed until January after Trump is one\nAt but it's there and basically I was in the building and then as soon as it ended said understanding the Russians have emails own estimates when that guy is a western is said for the FBI now provide for the FBI\nHas big boys and girls as big okay so now that it's just an in where a so much has been under house arrest and the professor and he was talking about is what he's missing\nWandering next thing you know the FBI is talking to you and you're basically under house arrest tend to feel\nI mean it's been very difficult because uh you know my livelihood is is uh basically ruined at this point in all my business was based on traveling abroad and domestically I've traveled a lot of restrictions has been very difficult on my ...\nThe most beautiful thing go out of this entire episode has been the American public support for me and my family and I'll never forget that and\nHow do you feel about President Trump I'm a big supporter of President Trump I think he's doing great things for this country and I never lost faith in the ... did they try to get you to flip on President Trump\nOr I Can't really get into details of exactly what was going on with the FBI um but all I can say is I'm a firm supporter of President Trump and his agenda too of any Russian connection I have absolutely no Russia connection whatsoever unless you consider a think tank analyst and Russia\nA connection that I've never met and only through email and this multi is professor who apparently was working with FBI now wonder hiding somewhere in Italy\n...\nWho burned has been asking this question who for him to and then it's going to get into a conversation with her by more owning Papadopoulos\nFriendship I mean from the best you know you're not a detective\nThere I mean as I say that all all my contacts or completely in the middle east in Israel in particular in Europe I had to actually know contracts in Russia\nJust given that how on earth could a man like may be at the center of a rush of conspiracy unless I was completely framed by western intelligence to make it seem that Papadopoulos was interacting with Russians\nAnd that he's a Pepsi that started this whole investigation do you feel like this is a plot to unwind Donald Trump Kennedy and presidents I truly believe that uh\nIt was likely some sort of a plot by a western intelligence to assure that if Kennedy Trump is elected and remember this whole insurance policy that there will be up about Trump precedent or some uh excuse to really try and squeeze them as ... as he's trying to squeeze now and do you believe that if someone a\nHad a Pfizer warrant on you like they did Carter Page um I don't have a real evidence yet

Still in the ... the first five hours which means the tutorial I'm\n... ... to ... apparently is very very long a\nCouple like was said earlier about the introductory chapter most folks are telling me about how they spent a about two hours for the first ... yeah I'm Still in the snow at the camp type thing so I mean it's I'm not very deep into this thing [noise]\nYou know I think I ... the third shift or or are you nearly finished with it at this point\nDo we know how many chapters are and the game\nI'm not sure how much are probably the hidden trophies are good and\nProbably or you know when they could hit up the Internet I don't know if you want to know how many are in the game but I'm\nI'm a I don't really care too much about toilets in that regard\nI many chapters and read that too which is real underneath the suggestion of how many chapters in the Bible [laughter] um if you're looking for how many chapters you come to the right place click the link spoilers are inside a K jazz like four number yeah\nI Know that's all I'm looking for you ain't got to draw this stuff out here Mr website um\nSome of the chapters are shorter than others but some can take a full day a play at the very least one of the later chapters said doesn't say that there's that many just says one of the later ones\nA chapter six\nOkay so it looks like\nOr what does he say okay I'm looking I'm looking at they see rates in the chat room says eight plus two epilogue or six plus two below yeah say it looks it looks to be like six but maybe some epilogue thrown in as well so I'm Terry ... laws maybe as it is that it may be a possible alternate ending consider debate is what you do\nFrom what I'm reading in the article here it says once you're near the end of chapter six you may want to check out our guide on how to get the best ending and Red Dead redemption too so I have no idea I'm\nI'm not big on spoilers either a yeah that's sort of thing so I'm not too worried about it but if it does have a you know a different endings to choose from I kind of like to go through that on my own so [noise] um yeah chapter six chapters to at the logs achieve you're going to be dealing with so [noise]\nWell okay uh enjoy the game [noise]\nUm yeah pretty much like a few minor ... I have a little far\nNot too crazy\nYeah what were you saying our dreams are in fact I was about to ask a ... if he was still in the first uh\nStill the first to this he said three chapters and you've been playing well I think there is only I think there's two dis but only on the ones that installed disc and then the other one is your plate ask\nSo whether you never switched disks because all the disc actually after you've installed at all but this does is just they'll pick for verification down near the ... to this and I'm thinking he's just being able to find stalled purposes is not okay just once you play and so um that when they\nSo you're on chapter three or about to be done with with close to it or something like that so [noise] um I don't know what do you what are your thoughts so far\nI'm I'm liking into law\nClick travel is a bit hard to come by\nYou kind of have to make quick travel happen\nAnd even then not too good of a thing because the quick traveling in one direction but Ken quick traveled back to the camp\nOh that's interesting\nThough that a little bit complicated and you have to move loss I mean or a mission\nYeah I had to watch one of those videos why didn't they had to but I watch one of those videos of like here's some of the first things you need to do with the game I Love those because it kinda it helps me to to know what I Need to focus on as far as like when I'm playing and and and not to really my biggest fear is missing out on something early in the game that I can never get back to\nAnd so I like to watch these sort of things have like here's what you need to do that sort of stuff so um I was watching that and they said okay once\nOnce you get a little ways into the game you should upgrade this part of the camp in especially upgrade this or do this because once you do that fast travel will be unlocked that was like oh wow you have to unlock fast travel there is not a situation where\nYou play enough in the game and it locks for you you actually have to upgrade your camp or do something um to actually unlock fast travel um I thought which I thought was interesting [noise]\nYeah and it\nPretty well from ... from what I wrote called the whole ... great are pretty expensive\nYeah there was another video I saw where they're like hey you know don't worry too much on the cap stuff um\nYou can do that later with a much better ... this was this was early in the game type stuff like that the tips that was given early on in the game was loot\nEverything you yeah any any of the bodies the shooter whatever Luther the bodies search everywhere beef thorough and get everything because you're going to need that money later on\nYou don't need this keep your horse the worst you start out with it by the time you get the ability to pick up other horses is going to be just as good as any other horse in the game with the exception of some of the more elite horses that you can come across but you don't have to worry about them until much later in the game\nSo the horse that you've got is good and by the time you get anywhere to where you can get other horses the bonding that you've made with that horse is such a um a higher level that it just benefits you to stick with the horse that you had\nAnd what else did I read about uh stuff that you know help out members or you know people that you come across 'cause uh later on they'll they'll recognize you and help you out later with money or free things from whatever store the year and that sort of thing so [noise]\nYeah but you shouldn't be too charitable because some people are really trying to call you when you try to help them\nYeah I can remember that from the first game yeah\nI remember the original and\nIt was one guy and was a really didn't pass them and they called me over the top and the moment I Do the run up to me and pulled it off ... off the horse and tried to be able to\n[laughter] and\nThey just shoot him of course I've really careful to not hit the horse goes [laughter] yeah your horse can die yeah\nYeah you you ... you can get it and not to cheat\n[noise] there was a ... I probably a good point he said lots of people say they went too much into the cowboy Old West simulator for this game [noise] um\nAnd I know that they went to my plane enough to tell you that they went too much into it I also don't necessarily know that that's a bad thing for me I like all his stuff and\nReally depend on what kind of game you're looking for because the first few times the whole information pro or in the animal cleaning you what [noise] old is the word is fun but if you're doing it\nAll the things they do take a really a lot of talk\nAmong\nI can remember\nYeah I Do some other games I've done that where I got tired of it and it's like okay we have to go through the motions on this thing against um where it's really fun to see in the beginning and then by the hundred and Seventy fifth time that you're doing something I'm really tired was picking or ... I Can't remember what it was there was some game\nIt was for me it was building settlements in fall off for banning it got to a point where if the first the first time you build it up is nice and bodybuilder that way you like it but then every settlement in the waste land you can build build something for the I got a little ah\nTedious after that it meant it in something they may have been something like that where you go through an upgrade saying and Everytime you upgrade it does is really neat little thing\nOr to make sure that it doesn't but it doesn't break up I can look at it I mean what I'll probably do is eventually get another pair and then I'll look into repairing the swimming and kind of have it as a backup or get a repair to where I can use it and then have whatever it is I buy new to be my backup a\nMonkey that whenever you have a chance they made the pages of it or what a way it broke or the way it should go back to gather I might have a lot is I might be able to buy something you know five or ... than it might not what the best but at the at the like if he said that does the job and and the last five or ten years you know I'm up there it's not like the F I\nS thumb drives my memory from a you know looking at if I can think of them\n... we'll see about that because if it does I don't care how it looks but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Coosada", "day": "27"}
