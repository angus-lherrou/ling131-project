never intend to belong to any of the party than the party of freedom in progress\nNow should you ever feel the desire to know exactly how Abraham Lincoln really felt about slaves and people of color you need to take the opportunity to read the debates between the former president and the above quoted Frederick Douglass it will enhance your paradigm I promise you that will\nWhite liberals are the most racist people there are because they put blacks in the box insist that they think one way and if they don't they attack them as illegitimate all the while denying that their policies destroyed blacks that was from Dr Ben Carson\nWords of not just troops but truth and wisdom from a man who took advantage of the opportunities this country offered him and the man who shield should be held up as a role model for the troubled youth of today unfortunately for Dr Carson working to ever try and personally address said youth held up as exactly what he would probably be\nLet's see I don't know if you've ever heard most of your young and so I've never heard of the late or the excuse me the great football player Jim Brown\nThere has never been in my opinion a better running back in football

this country have made me a better person I don't think that we should take in the in protest I think we should work out our problems\nNow you have to understand that was him on the lawn of the White

one yes folks he would know that stuff because of his position at that time\nSo that's interesting uh I have read about what happened to them how they killed him and his pretty disgusting they cut him up while he was still alive they cut him into bits\nBut to me that goes against\nThe new the Mohammed bin Solomon the thirty three year old crown prince the one that's kind of taken over over there which purging all of the pro CIA people getting rid of the ones that were behind or who were held facilitating along with the elements of our own government what happened on the day of nine one one\nSo it doesn't make sense to me that he would be getting rid of someone who was thinking the same way he's thinking so I'm thinking the enemies of the ... been Solomon were the ones that killed this journalist\nThat's what I'm thinking because it doesn't make sense\nYou know a house divided against itself cannot stand and they used to run on the same wavelength because Solomon knew that his predecessors in Saudi Arabia help facilitate the attacks on them and let alone with the agency and some of the governmental agencies so I don't think he hadn't killed I really don't\nBut that's just my opinion I could be wrong and it's been known to happen [noise]\nThoughts you know I Want to be surprised if that uh if if they murdered him if they if they cut them up it was most likely ritual\nAnd stick it seems to be in because he was still conscious when they did which is really sickening\nYou know they they they they do that it has something to do with the uh uh ... the afterlife and and essentially\nYes and they claimed that can cut it off if they if they if they cut it might be just something about uh\nSomething about a knife you know because they used them in a sacrifice

really good podcast I've read a lot of stuff before Middle East on fire once again is Israel is attacked with both rockets and missiles enemies of Israel repeatedly do this and didn't ask for a ceasefire\nAs to why Israel grant ceasefires after repeated attacks must be because someone or something higher than Israel is behind it suggests the princes in rulers of the spirit world\nJust this could not only go hot at any moment it could it most likely will bring Russia and America enter the fray as Trump is totally Israel he will back them in any mood they decided to make\nAlso earthquakes are increasing their all over and the big one could hit at any moment meanwhile or changes brings so floods and drought to the world and all kinds of terrible terrible things\nAnd that's all that he

about the Titanic and there's some new stuff up or mental mental or just have claimed that there is no way in the world that ice could penetrates to you\nThat there's there is just it's

bit further and you're saying okay well Trump ... his not jumping the gun he's kind that you know rationally wanting to get more information before he makes the decision\nI think he already knows mhm yeah and you know how Trump plays this handy keeps it close to them but\nBy the way he's back then I think he already pretty much knows and then of course no about Los Vegas you know it appears that band that attempted coup against the print you then go and that was covered up and I'm not sure why\nBut I really think that is this what this is all about I think that it has been I'm\nRepeating

of time you know that I'm I'm I've been telling you there is a deep population effort on going there has been for quite a while\nUh we are at a war our government is at war with us one of the things is is not so much they're attacking us what they are facilitating or landing happen to us for instance this is from um\nConsumer Reports my mom gave me this new Consumer Reports test discovered measurable levels of heavy metals arsenic Kenny him and our lead in fifty popular package baby foods\nSome significant levels are concerned these contaminants are when the are often the product of human activity such a smelting and pesticide application and going to have significant negative health consequences for everyone but especially for kids in ...\nThey can include bladder lung and skin cancer type two diabetes and have children and grandchildren heavy metal exposure can lead to serious cognitive impairments behavioral issues and lowered a cute\nThey shouldn't surprise you folks that's happening everywhere the stuff they're spraying aluminum ...\nAmong I'm not even talking about the biologicals [noise] I\nI got to say this Thursday when I was here every time we would go outside to check traffic they were at least three control planes in the Scott every time and I keep looking up and I'm ... now Greg did there was one trail that had you could see a series of five numbers and I saw it and read the number off and Greg lick me I said look\nHe thought he actually he mentioned it on air we came back\nI'm Joey not so much and and I get that you know believe me\nSometimes I think I Wish I didn't know what I Know I Wish I didn't see what I have seen\nWhich I haven't heard what I've heard but there's no going back\nYou know you can't you can't put the the toothpaste back in the tube it's out [noise]\nDon't want to bring everybody down by trying to get them to see what I've seen it and understand what I understand but\nThis is for our good we have to understand what's happening they know we're going to wake up this is while they ordered seven billion rounds Apollo point ammunition this is why they're military rising all the different agencies within the government that never before\nArms and fight my I have a huge problem with that anyway what I'm saying is\nIs really gotten me stirred up these whatever they are I don't care where they're from but they're just going to lose and our borders and say\nYou know we got whatever stress in our lives and we need a safe haven and we need jobs and we need money and we need resources well I mean what country allows anybody to do that\nExactly exactly\nI mean that that that they were not compassionate well I think a judge to name just put up a figure that we give ... ... but ah I Can't remember a couple of South American countries or hundred is something I think it was a million dollars is a lot\nA ... to to support their whatever you know system of government or whatever I don't know what the what they do with it but\nIt's a ... point is ... is our government going to say enough is enough you can't come in or we're just we're we're closing the borders or close in this town until we can get control over it\nI think Trump that's what Trump's doing with this this group from the Honduras he sold Honduras if you allow these people to come over here and we're cutting out the money\nMexico's allowed him over there and a judge to name just the forty five day pass you know to come over there and she said well that's an a cop on the conceivably might get to the U.S border\nAnd they were not just threaten our southern border we're threatened ... northern borders and almost as much with Trudeau being this is ... you know my great you know immigrant point person he's just letting them the Muslim immigrants just walking and come in you know come on come all\nThe ... so now that we don't have to build a northern wall\nGo have to do some\nI don't know you know I don't know how much money candidate canceled from us I don't know that we give them money I'm sure we do we get another country money\nBut it it it kind of interesting that we just that the Trump this I'm doing air quotes now that's okay just re re or did the NAFTA agreement that sucked out over half of the you know manufacturing\nJobs out of America when new wasn't the Clinton's did\nBill Clinton was set up by Bush and he allowed Bush to be there when they sign it in the Clinton is the one that ultimately got it passed\nSo so that giant sucking sound that sucked out over half the manufacturing jobs out of America now you've got the the I guess what is it now we're stuck in a back the ones that took a job there were stuck in them over our border taking our jobs over here now\nExactly Ross Perot's said that and so did you call your little national industries here in Montgomery she said that at the time that you're going to hear this giant sucking sound all the jobs are going to lead and she's running and now but\nBut but the one I just said though they sucked out the manufacturing plant right\nThey gave the jobs to the south Americans and the and whoever else Canadians I don't know can I just got an MBA south Americans got a lot of men now they're over populated so they don't they don't have enough south Americans to ruin their factories that that got too many so now they're going they're going to ship\nThere's the the over killed up the\nOver here on us to take our jobs\nWow really\nYeah so you know what I'm saying in other words okay now you ship yeah if you if you look at the [noise]\nThe demographic change at the manufacturing plant I work at now you can tell over night a night and day difference within the last six months that the south Americans have almost overtaking the plant\nWow yeah\nI mean this is how fast epidemic that type you know they're taking our jobs over here and I I mean you you know they say might they might be doing jobs Americans on don't want to do but I don't believe that I don't either take any job better pay them money you know period sure\nWhat will you know of course you know they have a big uh ... you know a big lack in the truck drivers because I have so many deck I'm requirements on them you have you ever looked at the federal motor carrier safety rules and regulations book\nI've had a brother in law and father in law that we're both long distance truck drivers and I've heard stories\nLet me tell you it's ridiculous but guess what they're they're beginning to come to the realization that toilet paper from the same place everybody else does yeah I guess I\nGuess who delivers that two truck drivers baby exactly I'll just have another truck or the other day I said you know if truckers where to go on strike for a week litter on a month ... shells withdraw yup almost overnight yeah\nThree days three days and it's all about three days maybe everything will be gone\nAnd then maybe we could negotiate some ... you know deals on pay and risk that we take you know 'cause you know there's a lot of jobs out there that are higher risk but guess why they don't put airbags in big trucks wow\nBecause they wouldn't make no big difference if you got eighty thousand pounds behind you\nThe only reason they don't put them in an airplane\nYeah exactly and if I had an ejection seat new truck that might help\nIt might make them and that but after that I wanted to talk a little bit about the a guy that got assassinated over there and do the Arabian yeah you know I mean\nThere's no telling what got you know he you know what I'm saying here's you I think you hit on at nine eleven stuff but I think it's deeper than that I think he has so much info on them that they had the you know race that they had to delete yeah the ... yeah [noise]\nSo but it's the timing of all this because you think about it you know it's a it's a problem for Trump Trump is signed over billions billions of dollars of very high tech military equipment you know trade deal with them mhm\nAnd I think that's a you know like I said in the beginning even though he's made some he's they buy some calls that I don't particularly agree with it because I Know Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest\nA human rights abusers them on the planet\nYeah you know what I'm saying but you know in other words like the Saudi leader ... went over there I bought off by surprise I don't know what happened to it yeah but in their in their car ran\nA compound alive but if you say is what it takes ... farther Islam that's right that's exactly right\nI mean you know you can sit there to your blue to your face they have to tell you the truth he can tell you whatever he wants as long as a spy there in the cause of Islam that's right you're absolutely right but\nAnyway that's my view of things off calmed down there than I Am on a God Bless show and tell you all you're doing a great job keep up the work\nWell thank you for the contribution may take case into the you\nKnow Hey Nate\nEvening general knowledge great to hear your voice Hillary and\nGreat to hear you man because it's been a great not pay but I Will propose a different scenario for you for this border okay [noise] often the CIA will use operative and they will give them the cover of a reporter Brian or a photographer so that they can you know\nYou know you have your stuff they need to get you\nRight because you have an American citizen or an American operative\nThat working undercover but why would they would they be there if they want a reporter right but what if he was the the I ... a operative and the reason he were killed or assassinated but he was part of the deep state and uh\nYou know print or lamas actually recognized this and\nWhy is that makes you came to mind that makes perfect sense because we know that some some on trying to get rid of all the deep state all the nine one nine one one pro Bush people from over there\nRight that makes sense that makes perfect sense\n[noise] are you guys doing\nHanging in there man it's been weird there's some something weird going on we were you and I have talked about is just some sharing you and I talk about another email yeah I don't know what it is but there's some weird going\nWell like I told you I think that the a quote unquote matrix ... I think there's a new operating system up loaded into reality in a lot of free things were happening because now the Mandela back when we remember thing but they're not necessarily reality anymore\nOr owned a current and rented one is a failing you know because of a 'cause there are certain they're bringing certain systems on one or or using them\nA term like you know yeah\nUsing them when you when I was supposed to use them is affecting\nOh I have a a gritty made it a bit later we'll take care of my friends are good to have always loved your brother love you too man later\nI last break ... unreal as time has owned by two seven to nine two to eight we'll be back in five short missed oh by the way I just got an update from Glen at the end search and according to him\nThey have issued an arrest warrant for Hillary Clinton will see it that is true or not anyway let's pray that that's true I don't believe that either will be back in time and\nAnd I know that I watched the ... the guy and he was a navy guy they put him in after the age of ... to ... his job when he came back here at Toronto\nA naval station out in California was develop a system into the weather or whether worldwide mhm he's saying he says ... if they can they can actually a break and stop allow these things\nThey can learn about whether or not sitting down they choose not to like they want to strengthen them and hurt people\n[noise] but like I said well that's that's the yeah I don't know if you've seen the pictures ... that's some of the worst I've ever seen in my life\nTotally totally desolate just destroyed the up and\nSaw it on twenty picks up a notch go and they made up across tend to ... to ... uh what appears to be a if twenties to choose one Amish cut all launch pad at a ... do well\nBut I don't know uh you know they could and nobody seems to know one of those ... twenty are there's no telling three hundred sixty million dollars a pop a seven billion dollars and it's unreal and yeah\nThe logic to let him stay on the ground yeah we're just a logic yeah no one that's coming no one no one knows aircraft are expensive they're\n\nOut on the air to think about it it is anyway guys at Georgia show off your chest but they're not\nThinking Jamie thanks for Columbine and I'll have a good one you to take care [laughter] wow that's a good cost Knight appreciate you guys calling appreciate you guys listening guys and girls and ladies thank you um as I mentioned before there's been a lot of sites taken down from Facebook\nIf you can get on Facebook if somebody can find something an alternative to Facebook we're going to need to do something because they're starting to censor anything they don't agree with and I've experienced it with you to Bob experienced it the last four or five years they've been videos\nOne guy had a video of a a looked like a particularly see five\nGuys doing touching goes and he was saying you know see you can fly a plane this low off the ground and all you people who claim it wasn't a plane hit the Pentagon you know that the playing couldn't fly that low to the ground you know you're crazy so I tried to comment well there's a big difference between touching goes on the sea five and then flying a plane at six hundred supposedly six hundred miles an hour which is a hundred over its limit\nEven though you can't fight in their mind\nThey wouldn't let me comment you two came up it would not let me comment because well I guess I have a reputation or their um\nThe way their thing works it knows that I'm\nOne of those kind of people and let me come in you know but hey it's the truth there you can't convince me that a twelve foot diameter aluminum tube with wings in titanium thin huge twenty two tone engines on the side went into a twelve foot diameter or ten foot diameter whoa\nNo it doesn't work that way there's no way in hell\nA seven fifty seven went into the Pentagon is not possible\nAnd you can't tell me that you can somebody can do it through a two hundred and Seventy degree decreasing radius five gee turn and fly to feed off the ground in flight might come up\nEvery pilot there every pilot well not every part of a lot of pilots at the Pentagon have tried to duplicate this with the simulator it can't be done it's impossible and you're going to tell me honey honey here who couldn't fly a Cessna one Seventy two Cessna they were afraid to let him up in one of those that he can fly simply the seven and do that\nI come on man that's ridiculous\nWe got a caller\nI ... I man how are you\nI was listening to you guys as usual and I've you know I've had three other Facebook accounts were locked out I'll\nYeah and again you well one of them actually told me a report

recognized former but they're the vacation you are\nThe personal may account and I heard of such yeah and you know I don't post anything or say anything or do anything that\nI Would think would get

reading other people's things I don't comment much I don't post much but I did put something out there uh yesterday or last night there was a a\nArgentina Buenos Aires a newscaster was they were doing

good at it to ... you know facing now aren't they said that looks like Chicago to Miami\nAnd maybe one well I was wrong on the origin nation both flights that taken off from Memphis flown was gone in

thirty thousand feet they're not going to Atlanta certainly arrived to be much lower to land there unless you wanted to free the passengers [laughter]\nI'm wrong about the study of origin but you're correct to both flights came from the same city yeah and it was Memphis they were fed ex flights ...\nThat's interesting that they are\nReady to go up at the same time hasn't for basically

we're coming do you live from coast Toronto, Canada affiliate in radio news talk content [noise] last night I mentioned this news taught contend the old C F R B had been on the radio for eighty years correction is more like Ninety Ninety years [noise]\nAlso last night or should I say earlier this morning during the open line segment a number of\nShared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife [noise]\nTonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time an alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist\nHarry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears the bunkers of psyche ability mediums and the spiritual this movement in fact Houdini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and there are fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches to his abdomen\nBy McGill University student backstage at the princess theater in Montreal Canadian connection there on his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide best he would do so\nThen more than two years after his death\nHis wife best attended the sandwich conducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which forward allegedly channeled the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to by Harry and bass\nInitially best stated publicly in his signed in witness testimony that she believed Terry had in fact communicated to her from the grave later however she recanted and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the say odds\nDespite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nDuring all that time she said she received no communication from Harry finally after the last say also in October thirty first Nineteen thirty six best gave up saying ten years is long enough to wait for any Matt\nThomas ... is a writer and a passionate seeker of truth on a lifelong spiritual quest more than ten years ago Thomas wrote an article which he posted online titled\nYes yes this was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people do look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nA matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pads and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talk about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where\nShe claimed that he brought she bought through Harry's mother and\nHarry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing um and Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI was he sort of outed her in public didn't need any out her ...\nYeah yes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this that play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow part of his debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess to audiences how it works so they would sort of do their own\nOn stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coded mess said that that Harry and best could communicate with each other\nIn order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody method um\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of ten words\nAnd the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through Ken and number can can also be taken to be zero\nAnd so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin that's how the trick would normally work when Henry invest first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married they would do this little trick where they would\nHave someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket ... ... what is the last two digits on the coastline\nAnd they these were which ... play answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly area I Know you can do this\nAnd that would be number eight and so it has a natural ... to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins at best\nHeld in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight and because she would say she's communicating to invariably using these code words and she said quickly\nQuickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eights worry in in the rye secret Cody ms so he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right makes size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passed number can but the way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now ... please speak quickly look be quick and as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical dot com infinitely mystical\nDot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry Hi and\nThere's a link on the coast of now let's talk about this call because after the\nMessage was delivered to bath and she said that it works somebody\nQuickly said hey this was all in a book is all already published in a book this is no big deal I thought and I read this on line a number of times someone would say within the book but they wouldn't say the name of the book out of the people are saying it's unpaid da da da da da da da da and then I\nFinally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was\nSo surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county and for all of the twenty five cents they would move at book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book I couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just all of that may not say there's a link inside\nSo that book does talk about those ten were and how it used to form numbers but not out of warm or\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd gum it see or hear Eisen bullet points about it that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coded word rose about that the secret message would include the word to leave and the actual\nSecret ten word message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend of Harry Houdini so in this person says odds not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone just took him at his word did not look into the book and just believe that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important for you to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nAnd therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the sale and and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this is actually true but allegedly he told them that I'm a skeptic I Am into bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with best\nOutputs are not in just a minute but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked because bath\nAnd Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us to think about\nHow well we love one another and all of a a little bit we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of his clients is getting and reading and Harry's mother the spirits you'd already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in his on putting the word for give an all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWhile baskets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have and she says\nIt's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit was surviving death and sort of got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was ...\nWrong when he was pushing back against the mediums and he did Thomas I got a jump in here forgive me Thomas I gotta jump in and got a break coming up\nWe'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and bass Houdini here's Jean night take initiative to break with do me on coast to coast am [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and the the the essay we're discussing a Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com that Thomas Thomas so let's get to the the say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there Ford shows up and ah he Arthur Ford usually worked for the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help\nOf his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show or very theatrical show where Harry would work with Beth the same way they worked when they were on stage and use her as an assistant and\nAnd have her a well he was very poetic with theory very at times very touching and romantic and there were statements like throw open the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten\nKey words on the table and then they decoded them and after it was decoded\nThe message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that best as a nickname that Harry used for her was Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song\nRight around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring and so\nHave you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Rosa bell believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd that anyone noted did anyone know did Arthur Ford no that Roosevelt was the pen name for best or was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um so I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of set up someone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he and he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah\nI just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other ... and\nAnd again he just he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher ... just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coating message\nThen we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly looking be quick in and these all windy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yes\nYes and um\nAnd she declared success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on that uh this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's\nThat's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence given to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only hurt but three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that had happened\nI think so in effect of the newspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around fourteen months after that there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now denounce that anything was valid that there were any\nYou were in contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with the other hand cleaner a newspaper called the New York graph or erratic rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it re Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but I don't\nWant her name but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited\nArthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in a closet but there is hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Fort it's someone that's been page one person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says ah I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just\nYou know it's really funny because Beth\nHeard about as well as the reporter wrote this up and so bass responded in\nA ladder um to that same paper where she just completely denies that there's she's been\nA party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford\nSaid that they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she's very clear in this letter goes on and on and I'd never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted on a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nYou know and this was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter wind chill and he was um yes the social they go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it looked like it was a letter written to this um the Newark evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these were supposed to be private letters the letter starts off saying this\nLetter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity you know I'm just telling you I was no party Danny fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he confessed\nAnd then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further a muddy the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened other than she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened in one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends\nThey don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this faster\nAnd she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends being labeled and not\nUm and I think she just folded and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death to know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sounds in twenty nine was she recant Chang and changing their position\nAnd but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward ten thousand dollar prize\nTo allow anyone to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really wasn't boots with Arthur Ford\nHe could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer ... well that sounds you know pretty pretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said\nI'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress to be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation you know would have been much more graceful you see it I mean but it was just days after where she says I'm not going to pay the money\nRight so your your feelings are the best basically and she herself was and vowed to bunker for fifty years and so that the social pressure from her family was just too much and so she she caved and she recanted\nI just posted on a national jobs aren't that this junk can be a balancing act and you have to juggle many tasks\nBut the job is for head of accounting some of the applicants include alliance famers\nHave you met the guys in accounting their animals don't Rio de even find your perfect local employee Montgomery area hope on dot com local jobs that work\n\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control centers this is W.

know when people put out these lists you know the greatest presidents and so forth\nFDR's often on those lists uh you know right up there with with Lincoln and Washington and Kennedy of course I'm ... FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him\nAnd uh certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is it is in a mired in it in a horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment and the banks system had failed and there's just so paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah you know the president preceding Hoover and roaring academy going and of course remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things were starting to\nWhere it started serving who be able to afford luxuries and the country over got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise the taxes and put some regulations on and here that fast\nAnd you know so here comes FDR in ... a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering so he has a says ... of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people and also he thought\nAnd he did he did a great deal of helpful lot of people we put people at work and it was on the government the paycheck\nAnd um this was the experiment from the communists communist or to the United states of America had already set up camp in Nineteen Nineteen in this country and so all of this\nFriends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're on their study or and so this is was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class\nAnd there was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking food to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put every once in a work on the government do so we could have this cradle to grave wonderful society that Stalin and the Soviets had\nFooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that there was going to be this great thing we're we're going to escape the uh the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all those new wonderful\nValuable capitalism I think you meant he I think he's the communism Senate Pico elements\nSorry about the ... falls and valleys in ... of of of capitalism you know so right\nYou mean ... if I might you because you you are you you print the list of legislative um actions that were enacted\nA in in who murdered FDR and just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy acted beer wine revenue act\nOf creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief act agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage act Tennessee Valley authority act securities act aggregation of gold payment clause homeowners lone act Glass Steagall banking act national industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act\nAnd the farm credit act\nUm and he I mean he did this really without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically rendered through I wasn't going to bore everybody with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I Will not\nDo that I'm happy to bore them with it here [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was rate out of almost like the communist manifesto that that he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it sort of [laughter] it certainly was the same basic control he was carrying just like Stalin style and just Persia all of his enemies you know if you got no way of style and you know you ended up that his first two wives his doctor who he told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with him or to challenge them politically\nAnd that kind of style and did it FDR did it by one packing the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know wary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so\nAll of this was going on in Europe is great ... you know he's single that's Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it so if this was a great a second new deal must be butter so\nI'm starting to put a you know implement a second new deal and they start to realize that substantial portions of it were unconstitutional so\nWe um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get past than it was I mean he was really really fiddling with fires I mean a tremendous amount and I know in the history books\nHistory books say a lot of things are I Know the history books paint him as this wonderful magical genie of economics us he wasn't it was an economic failure\nBut that was about all they were doing and the you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services we were all you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean that was it was a it was a cat us it was a cutoff because I asked her feet\nHow do you use the trading with the enemy act or to to to gain more power lend lease there's new spring the you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\nWell [laughter] again when he did was he was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the thing it was the same thing with the with the one lease program he was moving you know munitions and goods and services to the to the to the ... the access powers\nAnd he was giving them to the to our allies you know a free France included and eventually this the Soviet Union\nSo that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time\nSo there's a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started to ... he had to do that because you started to realize the new deal was not working\nSo there was there was a lot going on economically in in our country and then there came to a point where\nHe knew that we had to get into this war\nAnd the spies indeed and you know we have spies who I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries have them we have spies too are spies in Germany or starting to tell us they're finishing your have your water experiments and with the beats who rockets to carry the nuclear weapons for instance the globe\nWe'd be speaking German right now\nI mean they were on the brand so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time and has correct\nSo in the book you argue as many as ... a man that that FDR new Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um but then the question is Katie Katie sort of make it happen beanie let it happen or was he just sort of glad it happened\nAnd I say in my book that I think FDR was probably the greatest war president we ever had and that's because he just love war\nAnd everything to make World War two happened and I'm going to catch flak for that but you know what the words too bad it's true All right um the Japanese

affiliate in radio news talk content [noise] last night I mentioned this news taught tend to end the old C F R B had been on the radio for eighty years correction is more like Ninety Ninety years [noise]\nAlso last night or should I say earlier this morning during the open line segment a number of\nCallers shared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife [noise]\nTonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time an alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist\nHarry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears the bunkers of psyche ability mediums and the spiritual this movement in fact Houdini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and there are fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches to his abdomen\nBy McGill University student backstage at the princess theater in Montreal Canadian connection there on his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide best he would do so\nThen more than two years after his death\nHis wife best attended the ... conducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which forward allegedly channeled the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to by Harry in best\nInitially best stated publicly in his signed in witness testimony that she believed Terry had in fact communicated to her from the grave\nLater however she recanted and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the say odds despite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nDuring all that time she said she received no communication from Harry finally after the last say also in October thirty first Nineteen thirty six best gave up saying ten years is long enough to wait for any ...\nThomas ... is a writer and a passionate seeker of truth on a lifelong spiritual quest more than ten years ago Thomas wrote an article which he posted online titled Houdini afterlife\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people do look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nA matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about through fan just fame crossing pads and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where\nShe claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother and Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing um and Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact\nAnd that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI was he sort of outed her in public didn't need any out her ...\nYeah yes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this that play out to the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nThat part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience was how it works so they would sort of do their own sort of photos\nAnd I don't know if they'd been explained to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coded mess said that that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody method um\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of ten words\nAnd the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through can and number ten can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin that's how the trick would normally work when Harry invest first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket political line All right what does the last two digits on the coastline and they these words which\n... play answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly area I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural ... to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nI cried so as the coins at best held in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight and because she would say she's communicating to invariably using these code words and she said quickly\nQuickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eights worry in in the secret code emitted so you know he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right makes ties right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend but the way of doing that and that's what we're used to make this code\nSo they would've had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now ... please speak quickly look be quick and as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just because people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical\nDot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry Hi and\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this code because after the message was delivered took bath and she said that it works somebody\nQuickly said hey this was all in a book is all already published in a book this is no big deal\nWell I thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within a book but they wouldn't say the name of the book out of the people were saying it's on paid the other that died and they wouldn't say the name that is driving me crazy and then I\nFinally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was\nSo surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county and for all of twenty five cents they would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book I couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just all of that may not say there's a link inside that it'll show you scan\nTalk about those ten words and how it's used to form numbers but not out a form or\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd um it see I hear us and bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the unincorporated word rose about that the secret message with in code the word to leave and the actual\nSecret ten word message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend of Harry Houdini so in this person says odds not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that forward with a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important for you to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nAnd therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the playoffs and and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly he told them that I'm a skeptic I ... I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try and then she has contacted basses\nSeveral years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with best [noise]\nI'll put them down and just a minute but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked because bath\nAnd Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us to think about how well we love one another\nAnd then all of a a little bit we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of his clients is getting and reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in his on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that's gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have and she says\nToo bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit was surviving gap and says this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur Ford pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue\nArthur Ford was well aware of Houdini reputation\nBack against the mediums and he did Thomas I gotta jump in here forgive me Thomas I gotta jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and bass Houdini here's Jean night taking is going to break with do me on coast to coast am [noise]\n[noise] you\nK. R. D. I. A. dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my gas the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and the the an essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com that Thomas Thomas so let's get to the the say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium reached out to her or so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there for it shows up and he either for it usually works the spirit name Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently\nSo president to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show or very theatrical show where Harry would work with best the same way they worked when they were on stage and use her as an assistant and\nAnd have her um well he was very poetic with theory very at times very touching and romantic and uh there were statements like throw open the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten key words on the table and then they coated them\nAnd after it was decoded\nThe message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that's his nickname that Harry used for her was Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song\nRight around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring and so\nHave you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Rosa bell believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd that anyone noted did anyone know Arthur for no that Roosevelt was the pen name for best or was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um\nSo I really can't say about that there is a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause I'm trying to brush up on his kind of set up someone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he and he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah\nI just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other were Irish\nAnd and again he just he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher does just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coding message and we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer ... please speak quickly look and be quick in and these all\nWindy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yeah\nYes and um\nAnd she declared easy access she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's\nThat's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence given to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only her but three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that it happened\nI think so in effect of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around fourteen months after this there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now denounced that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever\nIt's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or radical rather than your grass and tell me about this reporter ... is it re Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but I don't\nWant her name but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited\nArthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in a closet but there is hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange well the person that shows up is not really author Fort it's someone that's been page one person ate Arthur forward and he shows up and he says ah I paid\nMrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just\nYou know it's really funny because Beth\nHeard about at well as the reporter wrote this up and so bass responded in a letter\nI'm to the same paper where she just completely denies that there's she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford\nSaid that they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she's very clear in this letter goes on and on and I had never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted\nOn a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThis was written to Walter wind chill the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter wind chill and he was um yes the\nSocial they go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it looked like it was a letter written to this um the Newark evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the letter starts off saying this\nLetter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity you know I'm just telling you I was no party Danny fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he confessed\nAnd then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further a muddy the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened other than she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened in one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends\nThey don't buy this you know they don't believe in ... communication you know and so and I think that this faster\nAnd she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends being labeled and not\nUm and I think she just folded and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death to know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sounds in twenty nine was she re can Chang and changing their position\nAt some point she had offered up a an award a reward ten thousand dollar prize to allow anyone to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really was in cahoots with Arthur Ford\nHe could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer ... well that sounds you know pretty pretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said\nI'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress to be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation you know it would've been much more graceful you see it I mean but it was just days after where she says I'm not going to pay the money [noise]\nRight so your your feelings are the best ... basically and she herself was and vowed to bunker for fifty years uh and so the social pressure from her family was just too much and so she she caved and she recanted\nThat PBS pain to now four fifty one twenty to\nFrom Facebook PBS painting Montgomery\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control centers is W.

FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him\nAnd uh certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it in a horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment and the banks system had failed and there's just so paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah you know the president preceding Hoover\nAnd Rory economy going and of course and reading and remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things were starting to\nWe're started serving to be able to afford luxuries and the country over got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise taxes and put some regulations on in here that fast\nAnd you know so here comes FDR in ... and a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering so he has a ... of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people in order so he thought\nAnd he did he did a great deal of hope for a lot of people we put people at work and it was on the government the ...\nAnd um it was it was the ... experiment from the communists we communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp in Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information\nFriends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're a New York city or and so this was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class\nAnd there was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking who to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put every once in a work on the government do so we could have the cradle to grave wonderful society that Stalin and the Soviets had\nFooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the uh the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all those new wonderful\nAnd valleys of capitalism I think you meant the I think it's the communism said that because they miss\nKagan sorry about the ... the pitfalls and valleys in ... of of of capitalism you know so right\nYou mean ... if I might you can because you you are you you print the list of legislative um actions that were enacted\nA in in who murdered FDR let me just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy acted beer wine revenue act\nAnd creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief jak agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage act Tennessee Valley authority act securities act application of gold payment class homeowners lone act Glass Steagall banking act national industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act\nAnd the farm credit act\nUm and he I mean he did this really without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ... through I wasn't going to board everybody with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I Will not\nDo that I'm happy to bore them with it here [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was right out of almost like the communist manifesto that that he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it ... it certainly was the same basic control he was carrying\nJust like Stalin style and just purged all of his enemies you know if you got no way of style and you know you ended up dead his first two was his doctor who told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death for either disagree with America challenging politically\nAnd that kind of Stalin did it FDR did it by one packing the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit wary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so\nAll of this was going on in Europe is great war is brewing you know he used to seeing lots of Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it so if this was a great a second new deal must be butter so\nA new start to put a you know implement a second new deal and they start to realize that substantial portion is over or unconstitutional so\nWe um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get past than it was I mean he was really really fiddling with fires I mean a tremendous amount and I know in the history books\nHistory books they a lot of things are I Know the history books paint him as this wonderful magical genie of economics us he wasn't it was an economic failure\nAbout it that was about all they were doing and you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services we were all you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for\nUntil his death I mean that was it was it was a cat is it was a ... because I asked her feet\nHow do you use the trading with the enemy act or to to to gain more power lend lease\nIts brain you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\nWell again when he\nDid was he was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the thing it was the same thing with the with the wind lease program he was moving you know munitions and goods and services to the to the to the ... the axis powers and he was giving them to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually this the Soviet Union\nSo that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time\nSo there's a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started or he had to do that because he started to realize the new deal was not working\nSo there was no there was a lot going on economically in in our country and then there came to a point where\nHe knew that we had to get into this war\nAnd the spies indeed and you know we have spies who I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries have them we have spies too are spies in Germany were starting to tell us they're finishing your have your water experiments and with the two rockets to carry the nuclear weapons all for it so the globe\nWe'd be speaking German right now\nI mean they were on the brand so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nSo in the book you argue as many as ... and a half that that FDR new Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um but then the question is Katie Katie sort of make it happen beanie let it happen or was he just sort of glad it happened\nAnd I I say in my book that I think FDR is probably the greatest war president we ever had and that's because he just love war\nAnd everything to make World War two happening I'm going to catch flak for that but you know what the words too bad it's true All right\nUm the Japanese were there an oil debtor nation meaning they don't create enough oil to will run what they have to do in their country so they're getting our oil from us they were coming off a huge war with China they didn't the last thing they wanted was to go to war against us\nI'll I'll go oh\nWell like my mother taught me and at first you don't succeed cut your losses are run by\nGolly don't

the founder and chairman of the international multibillion dollar international data group is our exclusive guest on legends of success today\nBefore we took a break or we're talking about what influence patch young life I mean today's folks\nHum as public college he's well placed on the Forbes four hundred listed a couple of billion dollars of network as public knowledge but the point is how did he get there and what does he do with the money as a steward we're going to find that out a little bit later to\nGo back in the beginning of your life was a young man young a boy pat\nYou have um I call you a member of the influential mothers club a member of the insulin Celtic they're wrong\nThe other two members were Jack Welch Bernie Marcus both of these guys credited Jack Walsh of course a legendary she'll GE and burning Marcus go Home Depot they both credit their mothers having a strong influence that impacted the life for many years to come you found that is well did you not\nYeah has certainly in my case as well uh my father was a manager of construction projects by the buddy many of them were you know in Europe or in Asia and so he was gone for six months or\nA or nine months or so at a time\nThough my mother probably the biggest influence and I'm telling my goals and values and one thing she ruins killed on me is that knowledge is\nKey to your progress you know and you should learn as much as possible you should do well in school and you should use out of your other time to learn and so I became very active member of the local public library and going in there and we're\nLooking for all the exciting new bucks it would come in and I remember one time I tried to read the whole\nTwenty volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica on that basis than I Would have a database of everything that has happened in the world but then I realized that uh I was only have a river mirror would ...\nEverything that happened before or the book was published so uh I realize the important thing is keeping up to date with the the new trends in the market\nSo I I Would tend to think that that paper route also talk to the value of delivering information ahead to influence you a little bit\n[noise] yeah I certainly made me impressed by people's enthusiasm for the information I was ... you know they were I was anxious they looking for me to come around and drop the newspaper of the day off that there are\nA on their friends that um and and then I could tell from um you know when I was coming in to make their collection on Saturday to uh for the delivery is that they you know we'd be polite and say thank you and I you know really\nA greatly value getting in the newspaper a timely basis and every day a week\nOr wouldn't moving on 'em you went to parochial schools as a young man is a boy and um tell me a little bit about St Martin in Philadelphia and was there an advantage or disadvantage going to a parochial school will do for you\nWell I think the um the nuns who are very dedicated to education and so they put a lot of stress on the quality of education and I'm making sure that we were learning and doing well in our uh our ... I'm going forward so that was a\nHelpful and they certainly instilled they\nKnow a belief and the importance of living a moral and ethical wife and uh you know and uh that ruin that God is an important a factor in your life and that you should follow the commandments and should treat people with respect and um they should make sure that\nYou do nothing that you wouldn't be a you know that you're not going to be proud of\nYou know having the best result\nAnd what you're saying to counteract a lot of the scandals rather unfortunate through there but there's so many more stories pat or they're not of people who do the right thing to make it to the top\nOh exactly and that usually a pay it pays off I think you know what goes around comes around if you\nHave to you know ways we start to see other people pretty soon that a deception is known and then people you know you lose their confidence in you and if they\nLose you the confidence in you then you have a tremendous a weakness in terms of they're not willing to trust you and follow your ideas that gesture and so um it is a very counterproductive to you know or take shortcuts that are unethical or in Morrow\nHad during your time and St Martin ... um that was a pretty competitive environment was not\nA Oh yes it was they had the various awards the medals for the best and then just subject than the\nUh the star list on the wall so there was a lot of the rating and ranking and er because I was a no one is to uh get on the top of all the lists are so it was a good motivator for me to study extra hard\nWell one of the things you've alluded to eventually you went from saint Martin and you've got accepted\nTo MIT my records told me you were the first student from St Martin's to ever get accepted MIT tell the listeners what you did a sister so creative um the project they got the intention to touch the MIT\n... you know I mentioned I'd go to the public library of several times a week and a one day I went in there in Nineteen fifty three and there was a new book that has just been published and was available called giant brains are machines that think that was the first book that tried to explain how could these new computer technology would really enhance\nThe power of the human mind would extend the memory facts\nAvailable to people greatly would be able to see patterns in data super high speeds and ... snake more insightful decisions and be more productive\nSo I got so excited about this that I took a about two months of savings so my paper route to the library and went down to the hardware store and bought strip civil whom for oil and a bell wire and a small light bulbs\nOr from flashlights and plywood boards and\nAnd a bill to pay a handmade computer system are made up little relays or that are played an unbeatable game of tic tac toe ah so ah\nAnd then I found out when I gave it to my friends that are so excited about this apparently interact intelligent interaction with a machine but then they noticed they could only time they would never win so\nI put a little counter in the back of every uh forty a move would be random occasionally they could win the latch on that uh that\nFactor of hope I made the machine very very popular in who was always lots of people queuing up to play it\nAnd say Gus would love you [laughter] and uh it\nIt was you know it entered into a science fair and won a prize and that attracted the MIT alumni association in Philadelphia [noise] uh you know to get me a full scholarship to go to MIT to\nStudy a more seriously computer science and particularly a cat and I was excited about the idea if you if you understood the organization of human mind and then you could actually designed computer is more effective for\nMore effective and they use for people because who would see the analogy between the human intelligence and then the intelligence created through uh the electronic design of these systems\nNow pat when you got accepted to MIT prior to that\nDirector or the new specials at your school\n[noise] uh well that was at a point when I did get a scholarship I previously um gotten scholarships to a number of the Catholic school and they could record says why didn't you go to Notre Dame or a villain over other schools that are\nIn the Catholic tradition and I said wait no appreciate that but uh\nI Would like to know public get myself I'm interested in technology and I wanted to go to school that has the best reputation for teaching technology and you know the the course to have a cap on there and be able to continue to attend religious services so\nI uh I said I wanted to follow that court to get the best education I could've subjects I was interested in and they just try to discourage me a little bit but uh I just stuck to my commitment\nThere being kind my research said that the way you're going to get it [laughter] you're buying the ...\nThere were um [noise] I think a much twenty thousand students before me that uh and never had a pie but has ever been accepted how was the first one to accept it to MIT\nYou are very humble man of folks are going to find out you know packets accepted at MIT he takes ... how old is a ... student make the transition in the business\nAnd build up what is today a multibillion dollar diversified business from a self made man building up an organization that's a powerhouse how in the world did that happen will tell you but his first big deal when every but when a second time in his life they told him that couldn't be done on John\nSaw that interview was on friday or over the weekend I wrote a proposal for this research and I sent it out to about fourteen companies and to my amazement within two weeks I got a\nCheck for twenty five thousand dollars each for half payment from nine companies so so I had a two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars the checks I rushed to the bank a because I had made up a name called international cooperation and\nBad for the proposal purposes it was just going to be a shot in the dark\nAnd then the bank said oh no that's a corporate name you can't put that in your personal account you have to form real corporation get by laws have directors authorize the bank account so I thought oh my goodness what happens is come all this name has already been registered ... who have stuck but fortunately it was in the form the corporation and\nAnd that that was all the capital that we ever put into the company was that two hundred twenty five thousand dollars\nAnd so I've become a big advocate of what we call customer base financing as well you can go out and presented an idea that people interesting enough you know they will\nThey will make them advance payments and when they do that they become a real advocate for you because they want you to succeed and they encourage their friends to buy the same thing and so they become none equity investors they\nUh they don't show up to shareholders meetings and ask a difficult question they don't charge interest on their cash cetera so well I Would say for an entrepreneur he can do the ... you can prove that market ... by going out and getting events payments from customers his both our situation\nAnd so what we learn from this that was another rejection the pat McGovern had another one you had split the other thing that when they're giving you money to it on an advance that sure puts a flame onto your but to make sure that whatever you make it better be darned good rice\nUh oh exactly real obligation to perform uh you know at the highest level and the people are expected\nHis own responsibility we get back folks that's just the first of all of them were in and talk about another opportunity that again a pat was told this will never work don't you

Institute and in this conversation with mark ... and we will highlight some of the differences between the mainstream economic theories and the Austrians\nNow that means is Institute is a wonderful local asset in my mind the whole area so visit the website ... dot org M.

S. dot org and they have a wonderful wonderful\nDaily articles all sorts of archived essays\nAudio lectures video lectures and they provide if you're interested they provide a men's opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students looking to advance their education in the field of economics or you could just be a layman like me\nSo again visit the ... Institute website muses dot org and now let's go to my conversation was senior fellow of the means is Institute ... are you doing\nToday more I'm doing great it's a pleasure to be back on your show\nWell and today I Want to bring you into talk a little bit about the boom bust\nThe business cycle how we see these downturns in the economy and I want to start with little biography myself is I I had always been taught this is a natural thing you know what goes up must come down markets just are naturally volatile and need to be managed\nAnd I remember one morning though I was in all Vernon I knew about the ... Institute and I came across a little book\nCalled depressions are causing terror by Mary Ross bar and over I think a cup of coffee two cups of coffee I finish this thing and he the way he presented the boom bust I'd never heard of before is that how are all these entrepreneur\nThe market and breeding price signals how is that they are all of a sudden Raul all at once these people that were great the market tests entrepreneurs pretty darn well how can they just all the wrong\nThe Austrian School has a bit of a different perspective than most people out there about the boom bust cycle and you yourself referring back to a thousand eight or saying early on there is a bubble that housing and this is what's causing it\nAbsolutely the business cycle is incredibly important um it always says ... will be a because it means changes in income changes in jobs at affects everybody\nWhether you're losing your job or your home or your customers are\nA it's a very very important and it's largely unexplained by mainstream economist Austrians on the other hand I have known for a century the reason for these booms in the economy and the busts in the economy\nAnd let's start with something that most people know if you're an economist if you're a banker if you're a construction company if you're in real estate you know that when interest rates are low\nPeople are building houses they're building businesses ah they're expanding and so forth and then when interest rates are high it's much more difficult to build houses in businesses and to expand into by automobiles and so forth and what the Austrians have done on top of that\nIs to explain why we get into these economic problems so sometimes when interest rates are low it's normal natural thing and it's related to economic growth that doesn't result in a bust or in a recession but during other periods those\nSame low interest rates that cause an expansion in the economy do result in a bust and so what we've discovered is that when the central bank in the United states which is called the Federal Reserve artificially reduces interest rates below with the market would have set\nThat's when you get this artificial expansion were all these entrepreneurs go out and start building houses they start building businesses um they started expanding\nBut ultimately when resources are available to finish all those projects and interest rates are higher the prices of materials are higher and the prices of the output that they're going to be producing a turn out to be lower well that's when you get the crash that's when you get the bust\nAnd that's when the economy goes into a recession\nSo then this isn't necessarily a case of over investment that it's not just that the price signal the interest rate is pushed down causing people to does economic activity over ... Malik vestments ... socially invested in the wrong thing\nThat's correct during normal natural economic growth people are investing in the right things that will ultimately satisfy consumer wishes and demands and the future\nBut during an artificial expansion entrepreneurs are encouraged to undertake all new um [noise] more complex types of investment and so you know a normal type of investment\nWould be normal production manufacturing distribution but a a a new type of in a distribution chain would be like Amazon you know we're not sure if Amazon as a male investment uh but it's a whole new way of doing things and Amazon\nThere's um into all sorts of a distribution systems robots and so forth and as I said ultimately we can't know for sure what's a male investment what's a good investment what's normal investment and so forth\nBut just to give you the idea that entrepreneur is are investing in all sorts of new um unexplored things\nSuch as Amazon and various types of social media and that sort of thing\nWell and we saw it in two thousand and this is before I'm watching the scene at all but there's the dot com boom and bust\nAnd out of that and that's what I Want you to speak to you get people believe folks like Paul Krugman saying we need an inflationary bubble in some area of the economy the fed needs to intervene and lower interest rates and wages for growth and say sucker like housing\nNow you were on top of this year or early on way before two thousand eight saying there's something going on here and it's not going to end well\nThat's correct um after the dot com bubble bursts in all of those a Silicon Valley companies went out of business in the United states went into a recession\nAnd Paul Krugman the economic columnist for the New York times and and Nobel Prize winning economist in his column actually called for the fed to stimulate a housing bubble\nAnd it wasn't until a few years later that we went back in uh\nTook those columns and took the quotes out of those comes and show the American people and our what our viewers that ah that Paul Krugman was actually advocating the housing bubble and ah the fed did lower interest rates down to one percent it did\nA expand housing enormously in terms of the number of houses in terms of location of the houses and in terms of the size and lavish ... of the houses that were being built\nAnd uh as a result uh in two thousand four I wrote an article on beaches dot org\nCalled housing too good to be true question mark where I basically laid out\nAll the relevant facts regarding interest rates the expansion the artificial expansion of credit in the United states the amount of mortgages that were being undertaken the number of houses that were being built the average price in size of houses\nAnd uh and so in several other are writers on me says dot org were also discuss it in the housing bubble what was causing it the central bank artificial low interest rates what would come up with this well it would be a crash and the economy in a recession or and so it was not\nAnd they'll do anything to try to prevent it including these abnormal monetary policy's that they've been barked on [noise]\nSo they really have a phobia because they think that if we go into a deflation every period where prices and the economy are\nFollowing that will enter another Great Depression from which we will never emerge they don't really have any analysis that goes along with that they don't have any theory that goes along with that they simply point to the great depression of the Nineteen thirties and\nThen embarked on these abnormal a monetary policy's\nAustrians on the other hand have a different view\nAgain it's in line with the main street view not mainstream Keynesian but Maine's street as an entrepreneur Z and normal citizens that falling prices are a good thing\nThat we like to see falling prices for the things we buy a new families would like to see home prices lower\nAnd so on a and not only do we think that deflation the economy is a normal thing in a market economy that prices will be going down and the value of our money would be going up that's what we'd like to see in a free market economy\nBut even in the government intervention economy where you have a central bank where you don't have any backing for the money [noise]\nUh deflation still plays a very important role because when the fed creates an artificial bubble [noise]\nEventually that's going to burst and the boom is going to come to an end and how do you correct for something like that well\nDeflation actually is part of the whole correction process because once you go into a correction the price of assets stocks and bonds real estate and so forth those prices fall significantly the price of labor\nAlso falls substantially\nBut the price of consumer goods does not fall quite as much especially\nThings that we consider necessities that we purchase on a regular basis toilet paper toothpaste food milk and so forth\nThose don't fall much at all and so when you see this kind of deflation where capital goods assets land building houses of factories office space fall enormously\nAnd the price of labor fall significantly and labor becomes very abundant when you have unemployment so there's plenty people looking for jobs and yet consumer prices are not following that much and as a result when entrepreneur is look at that environment where you\nTake capital and they can hire labor\nAnd they can put them together to make consumer goods and make enormous profits and so the whole deflation reprocess once you break it down into capital labor in in consumer goods you see that that's really the thing that fixes the economy\nSo instead of falling into deflation spiral\nWe see it as the corrective force in the economy and it's not a spiral downwards it's more like a shock absorber whereas prices fall\nIt braces for the economic problems and causes conditions\nFor an economic expansion and so when the government does not intervene\nI'm In a boom bust where they don't react to the bust the economy are typically goes in a v shaped formation where you have a sharp downturn in a sharp up turn when the government\nDoes intervened to try to stop the bust what happens is you get an L shaped economy where the economy goes down but then it flattened out and it stays down and that's essentially what we're experiencing today\nBut and it makes me think of the sort of standard argument against the ... that if you know the price of something that's going to be lowered Mario way to buy it\nAnd so we just keep going down down down but of course I I think got stealing us from Tom ... says to you know okay maybe that cup of coffee is going to be two cents less tomorrow but I still want a cup of coffee\nOr eventually people are going to want to buy things and use things that are not just reacting the prices we react to prizes but we want to buy and sell things that are they live and just sit and wait all all day and for many months\nAnd I believe correct me if I'm wrong that a lot of the big companies we know of the day get started in that\nThe the bottom and the trough of these downturns that you see these falling prices and people do see these offered him [noise]\nThat's right I mean consumers they will put off some decisions in terms of like buying a house or buying a car but in terms of milk and gasoline and everyday ordinary things are going to be buying them anyways that's why I point to\nYou know the ... the fall that the lack in the fall of consumer prices relative to the other input side of the economy\nBut one of the things if you look back\nAt the recessions in the United states is that during those recessions\nThat's when companies are put together and they're putting together more efficient better new or higher quality goods and services for consumers and so if you go back and you look at the history\nOf some of the important companies today like Microsoft and Google and Amazon and all of the new things that have come on line over the last couple of decades those things have been put together\nDuring recessions when entrepreneur Z\nA can find office space they can find warehousing space they can find plenty of technical people and engineers and\nEverything that they need is now either more readily available or at a much lower price or both and so that gives entrepreneurs the opportunity\nAt a very low cost\nAnd ease of operation to start up new companies new ideas new products and services uh and so that's sort of like the silver lining to this process but it what it does do is it highlights\nCorrective progressive thing uh for the economy because it sets the conditions that entrepreneur seek which is low prices of their inputs capital labor land warehouses and so forth\nBut it also um the price of consumer goods whether their brand new products or existing products or have not falling as much so that's why deflation\nShould not be feared it should be embraced and unfortunately mainstream economist um maintain their fear ever more so a than today and uh that fear of deflation is actually being used as a argument\nFor negative interest rates in the economy\nOr talking to mark the ... from the ... he's a senior fellow at the ... Institute NIH greatly encourage people to check out mazes\nM. I. S. E. S. dot org ... dot org and you can find a lot a lot more details um more if you are a an expert maybe think you're an expert on this or that has some technical expertise on these topics you can go that far on me to start or there's everything from the\nBeginner on these issues to the expert as a person who has a little bit more knowledge and\nFrom what we've been talking about it it takes us back to a sort of fundamental problem I see was how especially with the mainstream economists that particular political economy out of the politicians and folks in DC want to micromanage the economy or rather macro managing a\nThere's this they almost seem to forget that the economy of market economy should be a profit and loss system\nThat it almost I sometimes get the idea that we should never have any losers everything should always be going up there should only ever be profits and whenever there's certain losses for certain sectors people start to scream and say help me help me help me please\nWhere do you think this mentality as come from as a come from this idea of\nThe market is inherently unstable does she need a central authority to step in\nI'm going back to um John Maynard Keynes and they always talked about how they they look at it from this sort of ivory tower perspective and have the technocrats who can buy them manage the economy they also bring in not just mathematics and physics envy but\nSort of psychological critique of people these animal spirits and irrational exuberance um where is this where this sort of idea comes from that somehow we can never have any downturn and then the irony of course you prolong the downturn by trying to solve it well\n... they don't want people to go bankrupt or it spreads\nOr a negative psychology throughout the economy they they analyze the economy from the point of view of psychology rather than economics the Austrians\nView it as an economic problem\nHow would it work though you did not have a central bank pushing down these measures rides it seems like there are folks to it all we can't possibly do that this is this is crazy talk I liked the idea though of truly ending the fed and\nWhat would be the positive case how would the market economy work absent this intervention [noise]\nWell it depends on how much intervention you remove a from the economy if you were to remove all of the intervention or for money in banking\nOr people wouldn't put up with paper money basically they would demand something that was real intangible like gold and silver coins or things that represent gold and silver coins like checks and debit cards and so forth\nSo money would have to be something real intangible uh\n\nThe economy or interest rates would be determined by market forces so that\nSay people who save money would be on the supply side and people who wanted to borrow money in it and invest in things would be on the demand side and interest rates would be set by the market and so it would be\nWhere no one person or no one bureaucracy right now we have basically a a council of bureaucrats\nWho decide where interest rates are going to be and uh nobody thinks of a council bureaucrats as being able to make the correct market decisions\nAnd yet that's what we allow today\nWe allow money that has no tangible value and we allow council bureaucrats to make decisions\nIf it was any other industry like shoes or food or restaurants or automobiles the American people would not put up with a ... ... came up with or they would be outraged and yet\nThey've been lulled into accepting the system over a very long period of time where the gold standard has slowly been withdrawn and market forces have been forced to be silent or in this market place and so\nMhm it not backing banks and providing insurance on deposits a depositors would be much more careful with where they stored their money and so what are strange would expect\nIs that banks would have\nDemand deposits which the banks had to hold on deposit so that there would be essentially one hundred percent reserves of your money in your demand deposits which you could write checks on and use a debit card on\nBut there would also be time deposits where you could give your money to a bank for a year or two years or five years in the form of a bond\nAnd the bank could then use that money\nTo lend to people for automobiles for houses for business investments in inventories and payroll all that so our money would be protected\nUm it would be on demand it would be in the bank and ah and if we wanted to earn interest a on our money we would just simply by a bond that the bank was selling\nAnd of course there would be a lot of other intermediaries or in the banking system such as money market mutual funds\nSo we have every reason to believe that money and banking would be very stable um and we wouldn't have the boom bust we wouldn't have price inflation\nUm and we wouldn't have all this economic instability and money in banking would operate just like all the other industries that were used to selling our services into and buying products it would be\nVery stable it would be very efficient and consumers would like those products just as much as they do other products that are produced in the free market economy\nAnd we would of course still have downturns a particular industry as a certain ... oh my God you know provide what the market is demanding but you as you just said it wouldn't necessarily be a\nSystematic failure\n... being tethered by and I hear what you're saying is that you would have\nInterest rates set by what is a real old savings what are people willing to win or people willing to borrow at it would just be a market price like any other price interest rate would be and this would lead to a great deal more sustainable growth [noise] that's right when I say\nI don't mean that every from is going to survive and that industries don't see ebbs and flows\nAh we actually want as I mentioned earlier firms to go out of business that are inefficient and we want older industries that consumers no longer value to decrease in size\nAnd so the free market is a dynamic economy so if you think back a hundred years ago\nIn the United states there were about a hundred different firms are more that we're producing automobiles\nAnd as first become more efficient and were better suited to serving the interests of consumers some of those companies went out of business and most of those companies are now in fact\nOut of business and we see a small number of surviving firms that in a\nA inflation adjusted are selling automobiles much cheaper today than ever and the quality of the automobile is much higher than ever and the the types of things automobiles do today is incredible really\nTrees when the personal computer\nAh came to be in the Nineteen eighties uh there was an enormous number of firms that entered that industry and slowly but surely what we've seen is that the number of existing firms has decreased and to a small number of firms\nAre but there are very very efficient and they can produce millions of units at very low cost\nAnd uh that are much much better uh than the PCs the Nineteen eighties on every single metric and on and inflation adjusted price they're selling them in a much much lower prices are\nToday than they were during the Nineteen eighties and so that's what the we Austrian see is the dynamic free market economy\nIs that this intense competition from a large number of firms ultimately results\nIn a small number of very large firms that are incredibly efficient in dynamic and very concerned with the customer now if you look at\nA Keynesian economists\nWhen they look at an industry with only a couple of firms in it what they see is monopoly and they want to break it up into a large number of small firms so again they have a completely unreal listed view of how the economy works they don't know how in the economy works in\nA as a result all of their policy recommendations turn out to be very destructive\nAnd I find myself a ... a\nSnicker myself on the ah\nIssue of like gas prices falling oil prices these days or there's talk about some of these fracking industries are going to go out of business because of the following price but I Love that falling prices and I understand that falling prices come about because there's a glut of oil on the market you have a lot of people trying to bring all of the market\nAnd this is something I appreciate that have certain farms can't\nStay with it if they planned for that falling\nPrice they got a business you hear people on you know mainstream media you know freaking out about this sort of thing but in general it benefits the vast majority of mankind Oh absolutely\nUm of course falling oil prices is symptomatic of an economy that's\nRegress scene and and going into a correction and there's less demand for oil worldwide because most of the economy is in the world are now close to or actually in a recession but during the artificially low interest rates\nAre a lot of people took that opportunity\nCombined with the high price of oil to invest in New ways of doing things fracking and so forth which is great if you you're talking about a hundred and twenty dollar a barrel oil\nBut at thirty dollars it turns out that those investments were male investments though that's a good example of investments that were made when\nInterest rates were artificially low and the price was very high and induced all this male investment into the fracking a of oil and gas and it turns out that as that supply came on line in coinciding with the uh\nA shrinking economy uh the those investments were indeed male investments\nAre talking to mark

and Russia and so by the time everything is done when all the first on flying\nAlmost the entire world is without power and it's about basically the aftermath of an attack like that you're going back

the river regions most trusted voice huge dog not easily point one of them do and he sees me\nA couple of West point grad says whatever shooting range I think he went to initially suggested West Point and that's how I started to learn about it applied in my junior high school and then I ended up getting recruited for football to both Army Navy and air force and um all the time I was a senior had a chance\nAnd just kind of fell in love with it and that was supposed to get them\nWhat'd you do when you graduated\nSo I got out of grudging eighty nine and I was in artillery officer I had my first assignment or post was ah Fort Campbell Kentucky so went through artillery basic school and some other schools and and landed at Fort Campbell in um after my first summer there said I'm a big way we ended up getting deployed to Iraq and Saudi Arabia in Nineteen Ninety\nOkay then when did you get out and what'd you do when you got out of your life\nSo I went through Desert Shield Desert Storm wasn't sure if I Want to you know to a career or not but it you know back and it was just funny because after nine or ten months in theater wearing live rounds and grenades and doing the deal and then I remember very specifically coming back to Fort Campbell\nAnd putting it out of uniform again with my chance route fast and then my boats talked in our blank adapters on and and I just you know the thought of the time was we're gonna just practice the next Twenty years and we're never going to see any action I just\nChose to get out get out of the business world looking back I look at you know the just challenges and the hard times and deployments and all the things that have happened since then and for my classmates that are still in and then I just\nAdmire everything they've they've done in their service but\nFor me I got out and I took on a road job originally through um [noise]\nA recruiting for that kind of chased people getting out of the military and ended up in Dover, Delaware for a while for about three or four years in the commercial credit business learned all about finance on that kind of thing and then had a kid moved back home to Michigan and so that the end my career in nature and benefit and insurance field\nOkay we've got a lot in common I spent some time in Fort Campbell to back when it was airborne that's how long ago was\nAll right I Know the game I also deployed with a hundred and first we went to Vietnam little different trip when you came back to Michigan you settle down and you obviously a sound northwestern new show where they found you obviously you like it because you got one heck of a good award talk about what you do there\nI began my career and the Employee Benefit and insurance business originally with eighty pay which is a large payroll company and they had a division called total source which was like a nature and benefit outsourcing arena so I did that for about eight or nine years\nLeft there to run a large group sales and service for humanity in Michigan which is a large national insurance company that many in the military no because of their involvement with\nMilitary healthcare delivery and retiree health care\nAnd then it got recruited to come in northwestern mutual into doesn't tend to run a small kind of flailing Employee Benefit agency that was part of the northwestern Mitchell system\nAnd it was really a great opportunity I didn't know a lot of on northwest of mutual I'll tell you that in the insurance world growing up you know we were born and raised to learn that usa is wonderful and it is a tremendous company that I've always had a lot of admiration for about a client of usa since I was a kid I was point still am to this day\nYep slide northwestern mutual I Would say parallel and rivals usa in terms of quality integrity financial strength\nAnd I didn't really know a lot about that when I got here but very quickly an ear to after I was here it became nuts so my specialty is employee benefits it's been working with companies to help put together\nA group benefit plans for medical dental vision in life disability all those things retirement plans glove that work aton and uh and we had a great run for the last seven or eight years here\nThough it sounds it sounds like it and you were their employee benefits advisor of the year right\nYeah so Employee Benefit advisor magazine is probably the largest industry publication we have it's connected to the national association of health underwriters which is our National Association and each year they select four or five different categories of benefits specialists to recognize and then an overall advisor there so I was fortunate to be selected for that this year ...\nCongratulations and it was great this is colonel den and goings on lines of freedom and I'm shooting the bull with West Point grad ... since we are west pointers\nAll and in another month played navy downing prognosis on how those are going to come up\nSo that's a loaded question 'cause I uh actually played football from Rick my first two years there and then had a couple of minor surgeries and didn't play but that was back in the gym young era of army football and\nAnd he was amazing and you know I think three out of the four years I was their army went to ball games we beat navy at least three or four years and I was younger and we're really had a tremendous program as we struggled for a long time but I'm so proud to see what coach Montana's doing now I firmly believe we will take both games no questions asked\n'cause aren't we just got that momentum going and they've got a really solid team and programs that I had a chance to take my youngest son on a recruiting visit to arming couple of years ago and saw their new facilities incredible I mean just everything about West Point or athletic program so our first class division one quality\nSo I think army's got a good thing going\nWell I agree with you and they certainly have been doing well so far so therefore ah looks like we're going to keep the commander in chief trophy absolutely so what do you do when you're not taking care of your kids and a and handling employee benefits ... what do you do for fun\nAnd you don't hunt and fish a lot that's kinda my a therapy actually at West point I was very proud as soon as the president hunting and fishing club which is one thing about the academy is there's all these obscure different things you can do in terms of sports and activities and very much enjoy getting outdoors and Michigan's a great place to do that or we get a small family farm up in the thumb area where the hunt on and\nJust trying to get out get as much as I Can't and a lot of my weekends are tied up chasing my kids around the country because they both are two hundred three play football and it's a lot of fun to watch out of the college level\nYou know washing your kids do well at anything is fun you really have the hunting and fishing club at West point I was captain of the west point chess club I couldn't play chess very well but it was really going to study to trips so that is happening or what's\nThe toll taker right I think I Belong to the drama club the Spanish club whatever club could get me a free weekend out of there that was definitely a fun part of my time there\nIt was they were about a lot of time going back to your profession is there any kind of advice you would like our listeners to know that some insights you might share it might\nHave been in the Employee Benefit in human resource arena for about Twenty years\nIt's a tremendous field I think a lot of people in the Employee Benefit arena had been kind of a lot of the people that are in for a long time I've been chased away because of all the fears around health care reform in you know this projection that the government's going to take over health care\nUnder any scenario and I don't think our companies are countries that are going to go to like a single payer government run system but even if we did go to something like that there's plenty of opportunity in this industry for professionals like us to get into an add value to companies because companies are always going to compete for talent in this country\nSo from a career perspective and I think anybody in the military is discipline they're smart they work harder and vicious this industry I think it's got just tremendous potential or in the future so happy to talk to anybody about you know what that looks like for them\nCool how could people contact through my a Web site will show benefits group dot com an easy way to do it or they can always email me a David that so called ah that's that's okay well we'll start benefits dot com\nAs you lose it had to help me down here for

man who never ever had a light library book it's David Stern is\nThank you rest the man you just keep on making me feel is a man I'm here for so today we're talking about the the things that ah can make you feel warm and fuzzy a new new laws in a how Trump is coming out with some new stuff\nMhm and uh I understand he's coming out with a lot of stuff is going to help people who were trying to put away money for their retirement\nThat's right now a lot of people say well you know my retirement is going to get locked up I've got a\nA as a retirement program that little I did a little chastising a little earlier before the break a\nMedical workers are being done wrong in this city because they should be able to take money I Wonder if it demand and a half even though they're still employed if anyone is listening to this is a management person you can change that all you gotta do sailing investment company to change that or get that you know what out ... and lives will be another one that will do it for you\nNow I Want to say right now I Know for a fact\nThat uh and you do too I'm sure in in the medical field right you know nurses work hard they sure do now when they went on that TV show what was that the view\n... odd just want to put my foot through the television talking about nurses didn't work hard and they or you know just a bunch of prima donnas now I Know that these are not been in the hospital is and I know you know nurse comes in their spends ten minutes for me I'm not one not only one on that floor and she's got to look after\nAnd you know\nI'm a ...\nThese people deserve the respect of course their male nurses to write their ... their in their wording they're taken care of folks and then not getting the appreciation and they they don't need this this problem that you just mentioned well it's not just nurses\nYou got the laboratory people ... who who should have a lot more respect in you know\nThey're they're kind of like the unknowns you got the X ray and the radiological people uh you've got to physical therapy people you've got all the you got all these different aspects you you've got the transportation people you've got the pharmacy\nYou know everybody works as a as a you know as a unit that drove the hospital or machine right\nAh but the fact is when you when when a when a hospital\nPuts together a retirement plan and they get snow covered and I'm going to use the word snuck it by the investment uh people ...\nInto a allowing a contract to sign that they can't take the money out when they're fifty nine and a half and then even though they're still employed ... is something wrong with it because a lot of people break down and they want to start working part time or they want to work\nOr somewhere else and keep that job a little bit you know but the fact that they if they work in just one day a month that investment company says you can't have your money and you're like sixty five sixty six Seventy years oh almost and you can't get any money\nThen you have to quit your job so you get your money that's something wrong with that picture of you know a lot of people when they get to that in half they deserve they said well we're just doing it so that they cause we might spend their money I get that patriot but what if you're fifty nine and a half and you've got quite a bit of money and then you want to take some of it out and put it\nWhere it's safer for example because maybe they don't have a safe mode that you could go into and then you're kind of stuck in a mode that you don't want to be and they need to put some more liquidity and these things so these four O. one K. is are getting that way ... the I'm I'm Talking but\nA uh those those plans haven't gotten to where the four oh one case have got ... and they're still not where they need to be ... but the full ... case have more protection mechanism a lot of them will allow you to take out a what they call a just to withdraw\nAnd usually they put in there like fifty nine and a half is usually the the primary age but they can put in their forty five they could put thirty five mhm it's all in the plan documents okay\nAnd the and the more liberal it is I see people all the time and trying to borrow their own money out of a for all three bay paying interest they're restricted they don't get their money okay some people would not say if I get I get the picture but when you're fifty nine and a half and you can get your money\nI think he went too far with it way too far\nSo how can you tap\nYour retirement savings without getting hit with a penalty by the government that's another story but we're going to talk about\nA centrally or that's called a Seventy two tea you say what is a Seventy two ... is it is called a Seventy two T distribution oh are you know\nLet's say you did have a four one K. they would allow you to take some money out before you were fifty nine and a half okay and if you worry then you're you're dealing with a good company okay maybe you could be forty five\nSo you say look I'm going to continue to work\nBut I Need to get a hold of some of that money because I've got children this into college I got this got that and or maybe they set up a program for the for the new thing with Trump maybe they didn't and we're going to get more into that\nSo the Seventy two T we'll let you take a distribution of payments over a certain period of time I think five years do hope that\nAt a certain amount you can't turn it off you can but if you do then all of them out of the money gets the penalty okay so if you had a hundred thousand dollars maybe you could take out five thousand dollars or ten thousand whatever that number would be\nSo so bright spot you know what I'm Talking about yeah yeah I Do I'm ... now lunch yesterday and I was talking to one of the employees at the restaurant and is it a\nEither right new guy and I said yeah I'm ... when your dad's law firm added on to the office I did the

good side of the downside of this um apparently there's been chaos up there in the marijuana industry and a lot of people are losing everything a third of the marijuana industry and some people are making a lot of money it's really hit or miss and uh\nThat that kinda thing terrifies me because it's going to end up happening is any excuse to make this negative experience they're going to use to go find some person who you know it went into the marijuana business and you know lost their life savings and and they're going to go out there and point out how\nThat means it's a terrible industry and things\nThere's no doubt that try to scare people off from doing this look big pharma does not want legalize marijuana\nBig pharma does not want legalize marijuana study after study a RINO

they have an eight percent cap I see on in the story in eight percent cap on retail pot profits\nSo they're going to try to make their money on other stuff other than the marijuana itself because a centrally the if you just do the math you sell about a quarter million dollars worth of marijuana just to make twenty grand and editing pay one person to grow hall that\nSo I don't know how they're going to pull this off of these ridiculous rules [laughter] it's like they they want to make it legal but then they want to\nPay him string everybody and make sure they can actually do it correctly or but it is now the world's largest market place for marijuana Canada is for the the shining see legalized pot we'll see if that helps I mean I'm not a big fan of candidate let's say if has helped

think a lot of people are saying it's much more for the film than any horror aficionados like myself and that is a little bit of a bear trap that\nJason Blum has stepped into this week Jason Blum is most famous for running bloom house which is one of the most profitable studios in America at\nThis time I mean grant he's not making these three hundred million dollar movies like the Avengers he's making a lot of smaller independent horror films he basically using the model\nThat was done in the eighties with the slasher movies and that's appropriate because that's what Halloween was friday the thirteenth was in fact really more than anything else spreading their teens\nPut this formula together where they spent less than a million dollars or maybe a billion maybe a million and\nA half dollars to make these small budget horror movies that within twenty thirty million dollars or more in the theaters and that's all you needed to drop profit\nAnd so he put that model together recently started with paranormal activity was one that really kinda rocketing bloom house to fame or paranormal activity movies are are cheap movies to make their video cameras and they're limited that's limited cast\nAnd that the formula you don't spend a whole lot of money making the movie and then the movie doesn't have to make two hundred million dollars to be a hit it just has to make twenty thirty million and their mood doing movies like truth or dare\nAnd that's one that came out earlier this year that was kind of garbage but he does a lot of PG Thirteen sort of disposable bluff horror movies out there that that like I said is very comparable to the eighties slasher movies and the horror movies that came out back\nThen so he's a very profitable producer\nHe was in an interview this week and he essentially said I'm going to paraphrase I'm not going to read the exact quote beans and find it if you really want to actually said that they don't hire female\nHorror movie directors because there aren't very many out there he basically says there's very few female directors out there and even fewer that want to work in horror now he mentions some of the female directors that are well known like the woman the director of the ... or something like that and he's been trying to get her to sign onto a project but scheduling doesn't always work and\nThe blue house crank the stuff out really quickly\nThat of course caused a huge firestorm in the horror community because there's a lot of women involved in hard there's even a month dedicated the women in horror month and a ...

on my\nEye on ... and I'm excited to introduce my new radio show called what's working with ... we'll dig into the trends that are shaping today's workplace and workforce Saturdays twelve noon on news talk Ninety three point one F ...\nThis is bill ... and you're listening to real clear radio our our news talk Ninety three point one or\nTwo weeks before Halloween Halloween falls in the middle of the week it was really only a week and a half until Halloween\nSo we only have one more weekend after this to really fully enjoying a Halloween spirit and go do the craziest on friday and Saturday Night and then we have Halloween which falls on a Wednesday\nNice kind of like it when Halloween falls in the middle of the week because that's one trick or treaters and it makes it a little more easy when Halloween falls on a friday 'cause really messy yeah I I have a son who's still trick or treat these ten\nBut I I like it when it falls in the middle of the week because then you can enjoy something in the middle of the we we can get so busy and crazy and uh you know Halloween on a Saturday as as kind of a nightmare\nBut since we're going back to the Halloween movies and we're looking back at them because we have any new Halloween film it's no third movie title Halloween you had the original Halloween in Nineteen Seventy eight\nWith John Carpenter directing then you had the awful just truly terrible Rob Zombie remake in two thousand seven I think\nWell to Halloween that gets a little confusing [laughter]\nIt's sort of like how when they made a prequel to John carpenter's the thing in two thousand eleven and they just called it the thing so they have the thing which has a pretty cool too but the thing it's it's it's a dumb way of naming things that Hollywood but you know who knows [noise]\nAnyways I wanted to look back at the Halloween franchise because a couple of years ago I went over to a friend's house and we'd been watched all the friday the thirteenth movies all in one day\nThan we did that a couple months later with Halloween and we did that with nightmare on elm street and I will say that while Halloween the original Halloween is my favorite\nFriend in the thirties as the most consistent through the series Halloween ... it has a great strong start but it it it deteriorates fast and I kinda wanna look back at those Halloween movies\nBut of course you have the original song I gotta kinda card that out on its own no pun intended because it's the one that started it all [noise]\nA small American [noise]\nYears ago\nRead\nThat another seven try cases are tough because I realized I was living they heighten that boy's eyes was killing simply\nThis was the original it's still a scary movie I mean it seems rather tame by today's standards I never saw it in Nineteen Seventy eight because I was like seven came out that was way too young to go see it\nI should not have seen that movie when I was seven I ended up watching it oh gosh I watched him on paid them back at a friend's house when I was probably I don't know eleven or twelve I was pretty young to see it and it was a big deal because it was an R. Rated movie and it had boobs in it\nBut I remember we were watching it on this tiny little TV I mean it was you know nowadays kids don't understand nowadays every even the small pay these are big and they watch stuff on their phones but he'll put the phone five inches from your face but\nI remember sitting there and my friend's house watching it on this probably twenty inch TV\nAnd his dad came in the room and it's not getting grabbed her legs ... because we were both facing the team in the early scream I mean there's a lot of fun and it was the original slasher the original Halloween is as close as you can get to sort of that perfect movie it had the trappings of its era I mean it's a seventies movie\nYou've got the fashions you've got the limitations from the seventies movie but the thing is for a slasher movie which is offensive with just as it started this last year crazy you don't need\nA whole lot of big special effects so you don't need a big budget for something like this you can do and affect the movie with some camera tricks and it was John Carpenter at the top of his game and yeah he had done some interesting stuff beforehand like assault on precinct Thirteen\nBut this really galvanized him as a heart director and his output from Halloween on\nIs amazing because you have Halloween and then of course you had the thing in Nineteen eighty two\nAnd you had the fog in Nineteen eighty which was an interesting movie\nAnd you had like prince of darkness later on and they live and big trouble in little China all that out put through the eighties was launched with Halloween and I think it really pushed all the way until you got to in the mouth of madness in the nineties which I talked about a couple of weeks ago when it came out on Blu ray\nBut you can never be the original so that's one of my favorites but then there's sanctions\nAnd I I don't like to break it down to a movie I like to break down in section ... the first sequels which was Halloween too on Halloween three seasons which I talked to great length about how much I Love Halloween three Halloween to find that it's an okay sequel it's worthy for it it's\nHospital instead of out in the trick or treat night but those are the first because they were trying to figure out what to do with the franchise 'cause these horror franchises hadn't really been done before so they had the direct sequel than they did the ... style one\nAnd and that kind of killed the franchise for about five years and you got to realize that back then that was an attorney for a horror movie I mean friday the thirteenth was doing one right after another every year there was a friday the thirteenth movie coming out because they were cheap easy to make and you can do them quickly on a low budget\nBut it wasn't until Nineteen eighty eight that they ... boot of the series with Halloween for that started this three episode run of Halloween for five and six and\nIt was every ten years this movement gets booted and they got re booted in Nineteen eighty eight and so you have these one where they had the the this new little girl the kids from the original movies the the two that she was babysitting had grown up and like in part fiction of poll run playing an older Tommy oil\nAnd this was in the nineties by that point\nAnd while those things do fall apart very quickly I mean part for his interesting in part by is okay and parts six is a mess but I I appreciate them trying to do what they tried to do in parts sex but parts takes is tough to watch\nBut then the next three boot comes in uh Nineteen Ninety eight when they did Halloween age too well and here's where it starts to get really confusing because\nThey had Halloween one to get three to four or five and six all follow the same story well age too I was a sequel to Halloween too and they bring back Jamie Lee Curtis so this is the well the third movie she did but technically she had done\nFor because she shows up as a voice on the phone line and Halloween three\nBut she doesn't have a part of Laurie stroke but this is her coming back is Laurie Strode and I remember being a big deal because it was Twenty years later age too well and this is a pretty good solid horror movie it reeks of the nineties and it feels like\nThat sort of dawson's creek horror that you got with stuff like the faculty which are fun and and now that we're Twenty years out of those they can work as ... for the nineties and by the you know ten years after it was it kind of suffered a bit\nBut it's totally up now in in the style to look at nineties Har so age too I was actually really pretty good not as good as the original but it still was a good little re boot and then they did Halloween resurrection which tanked hard that one was terrible that's what Busta Rhymes doing it and this was by this titles I think two thousand two\nAnd Jamie Lee Curtis shows up in that movie very briefly but gets killed right away\nAnd that was sunk lower than episodes sex\nAnd then they said we're just going to rebuild the whole franchise so in two thousand close to two thousand and it was I think ten thousand seven that robs zombie did his categorically terrible films because he completely miss understood\nWho Michael Meyers was the terror of Michael Meyers was it was this average everyday normal kid\nWho was a psychotic murder and that's what was so terrified he just made Mike Myers into this white trash hobo family that was abusive and mean and and and so the terror of what he becomes isn't that core of evil and\nAnd then and then it goes completely off the rails with [laughter] with Halloween to the sequel that Rob Zombie those were terrible I Am and anything that's better than those I think is a step in the right direction [noise]\nSo that brings us to forty years later we get the third time the series has been boosting gets removed and we'll be talking about that at the end of the next break along with the movie the oath on fat guys at the moon\nIf you're a baby boomer with one hundred\nIt's the important sixty seconds for your retirement we're sound income strategies and we transform typical portfolios that

by Baron Holtz and he's come out and said he was a guy who's from the Mindy project and he was in the neighbors movies and he said he has a direct response to Trump ism uh and and Trump as president and and and is definitely\nPlaying off of that sort of comes with the political point of view\nBut that's not necessary I mean it's what it's about but that's not what the movie become here's the thing about this loyalty oath that\nPeople are supposed to signed by the day after Thanksgiving and there's a department of homeland security that are in in vest the gates and here's the thing\nIs at one point this is about politics of Thanksgiving and look in a couple of weeks we're all going to feel this ourselves we're all going to go to banks giving dinner wrong on the run into a big political argument or we're going to have the person they're yelling no politics a dinner\nWell what's more interesting about this movie is what happens after the big family fight is one the authorities come in

opinion about the uh particular party that holds the office I think I think that Democrats and Republicans both are able to be congenial and\nAntagonistic and in the era in which a certainly the Republican leadership was congenial and forceful about their political a point of view but able to convey perhaps [laughter]\nSo much more smoothly than the current occupant in the oval office with the Nineteen eighties and Ronald Reagan with us to speak with us about this about the life of Ronald Reagan is ... is the author of Reagan an American journey Bob welcome to announce a new thank you so much for being here they're\nMy partner and I think the word you were looking for there was a civil rights are much more severe weather is going on in those days\nYeah you're you're absolutely right and that was kind of part and parcel of of who Ronald Reagan was and and maybe the derives in in some part from the route that he took to politics to conservatism he started as a new deal Democrat how did that shape how he\nInteracted with both sides of the political while\nWe're all you know or the one thing that regular learn more than anything about being a new deal Democrat was that you have to a\nThat our government turned on a compromise and so while he held dear to uh to Republican\nAnd conservative principles he was he was always willing to reach across the aisle and to our consult Democrats and to you know reach a middle ground\nWas it something particular about Ronald Reagan that made that possible or do you think there was something about that era in which it was just a more civil time is is is this personal or is it about the broader a culture that existed in the Nineteen eighties\nYou know I I think it was a little bit of both I mean the culture was certainly different from the way it is today\nEspecially in a Washington where you know at the end of the day I'm Democrats and Republicans would go out and have dinner together and play cards together today today they would probably lose their job if they were saying was someone from the opposite party but Reagan\nReagan really had a um he he like paypal he he was the night or he wasn't a divider and and so\nHe got a you know I I think he um\nHe just brought a different spirit to it and the ... I mean he was also you know he didn't have a hostile bone in his body so he didn't disparage people you know he didn't question your patriotism uh\nAll told that made it for a much more civil again I'll use the word civil environment in in ... in politics\nWe're speaking with Bob spits he's the author of Reagan an American journey it seems almost a routine now for a\nActor for celebrities to run for political office certainly in in the Nineteen sixties and in the Nineteen eighties that was not the case um\nHow did Reagan's experiences in Hollywood shape who he became as a leader first is uh the governor of California and then as a president of the United states\nI'm er and you're in front of a TV camera as well as a movie camera you learn how to to speak and how to relate to people ah through that medium and and so Reagan was able we're using those talents to apply them and to\nYou know and to communicate with the public who was as you said leery of an of an actor\nLaunch it himself into politics I'm ... but Reagan was always political he was on the on the sets of\nHis movies whenever they took a break he would begin to talk politics with all his actors to the point to the point where they really tried to avoid them after a while and especially when they want the launch no one wanted to sit next to Ronald Reagan of course they would get an earful\nGuy imagine perhaps at some point in a more left leaning a political environment in Hollywood and is an increasing conservatism that that might have become a uncomfortable and he certainly split with the many who had been more close with in the Nineteen thirties and and even the Nineteen forties\nYes Hollywood then as now was was basically a democratic or a democratic praise but there was a very strong constituency of of\nPassionate Republicans there are two of Reagan's closest colleagues is closest friends are ... power and Robert Montgomery where there were passionate Republicans and and they kind of went to work on 'em there I think they you know really dragged him across party lines and and his politics started to skew from left to right\nHow did he make the transition from from being an actor and a spokesman to deciding this is something that I Want to participate in in terms of getting to elected office\nOr you know at the at the ... his ... his Hollywood career came to to an end around Nineteen fifty four I'm movies were getting darker and there was really a no room for an actor with a a you know Sonny disposition anymore and he was he was getting a little too old and long and the two of\n'em and he didn't know what he was going to do with himself so he went to a he took a job a job he hated a hosting a a corn ... variety show in Las Vegas casino\nAnd every night he went back to his room\nAnd he he really beat himself up over over taking this job\nAnd he realized that it was time to reinvent himself again so we he took a job at G. and part of that job was being their corporate corporate spokesman talking to the men and women who worked in their factories across the United states and they told him\nHow um what their lives were like and what kind of and what made a lot to them and he listened and he realized that this was really just an avenue for him to go from being an actor and a corporate spokesperson into politics where he felt he could make a difference\n[noise] interesting and if it had prevailed his engagement in in an elective way he became a governor of California\nDifficult I think about that now but a lot of having ... California used to be a fairly conservative state or at least a solidly Republican state for for a long time how did his experiences there inform his quest for a national position\nWell you know like you said he ... it was a it was a big state and so a lot of the focus was or was on policy in California and Reagan really do right into that job but he learned something while he was there you know he acts\nUnbeknownst to to most people have passed one of the very earliest therapeutic abortion bills in the country over and above a his his taste for abortion because he learned\nTwenty five percent of the people in California were favor of abortion and so he decided that he would be the governor of all the people not just some of the people\nIs predilection for jelly beans um or how how how ... how did they become a public thing and and how did you know why is that aside from the sugar what I remember\nWell I'll tell you the minute he took office he put this jar on the table of his cabinet and he started working when you need a little energy I'm going to pass was around and you should each take a few jelly beans and so you know they pass it around ... rolling their eyes but each guy took a couple of ...\nMinute press heard about this whole blade jumped on it and he became majority being president for a while\nBob space he's the author of Reagan an American journey of an important piece of our our nation to remember and important personality in terms of who we have become and perhaps in terms of who we are currently a Bob thank you for being on now to this much appreciate it thanks so much Derek you're listening to now to the news and Derek Blair [noise]\n\n\n\nIf you're a baby boomer with one hundred thousand or more of an vegetable assets this may be the most important in sixty seconds for your retirement we're sound income strategies and we transform typical portfolios that depend on speculative gross into portfolios that generates sustained retirement income for life and right now\nWe're offering the latest book from our founder David ...
