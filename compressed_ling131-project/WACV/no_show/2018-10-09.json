how to stay away from stormy storm storm\nI don't know about well you're right and you know somebody the other day was talking about he was a he was mocking that\nUh that lady what was your name ... or ... ...\n... he won some forwards need to be ... him I said well he was one market or I don't buy or eat and what she said yeah that's a whole big mess we better not get into the van I don't think the ... the quantum physics people can get justify that\nWell we could find a way I guarantee you there's a there's a there's a quantum reasons already and they're only trying to gather in every ... liberals exactly uh\nOh somebody said their money's grain of course it is yeah but they won't ours too [laughter]\nSo today we're going to talk about economics it is probably very ...\n... years and we've talked about this on one of our shows but money and brains are probably both quantum phenomena and we've talked about why\nAre they are in the two builders a macro tubular of the new runs I couldn't think of that on the last show macro two beers a day think there's quantum a entangled with with what\nWith the rest of the world\nYeah everything's connected ... well it it really is only a ... you know you got\nThe ground there the earth there the flower grows out of the ground right and we come along and we smell that far we might even pick that flour has it had to be there's a connection there that made us want to do that\nYeah so there's been research on complex systems in ... we won't get into that you can read about that okay these complex systems of economic ... and they've published some of this stuff and there are a lot of it has to do\nAnd that ... that I Do not understand the concept of bitcoin ... doesn't exist I mean it's not it's not tangible you can actually get a handful of bitcoins Kenya I mean you know it's like it's on paper and the Internet well which makes it even more on tangible\nIntangible well less tangible money is an intangible ... well I mean you know ... dollar bill I got that in my hand\nSo all of all these things are just concepts man what we're used to our what we're willing to use as a method of bartering mentality as well as they used shells and they ... that's ... ... why would we use of\nWhy would we use them to start with what in tangled ... what quantum mechanics\nOf salt in trust mhm why do humans believe that another human is going to provide a service\nThrough this entanglement that's what it is uh-huh if I really want to look at it that way we're all in tangle we're all connected we're all have feelings\nThat's why the stock market crashes together probably ... I'm not saying definite if anything you do this and put a little for those in there because these are all theories they draw ... but they're probably a lot of lot of truth to it it's like diamonds\nYou know they they go down to about dom and these things are expensive right but\nThey're only expensive because people have mainly so they are hard to get in this summer if I wanted to I could go out and you know yeah I can dig around until I found one right that you know you got to know where to look for one\nThing in this world and they're they're rare yeah compared to say just a piece of rock or dirt fry but did you know there are plenty that are just pure diamonds\nBlack one hundred percent dime and I did not know yeah they have found that they are made out of diamond ... which is nothing but extremely hard hard hard hard carbon\nCoal ... that we burn you can you can ... you can actually uh they've got something that some kind of machine you can actually put some cold in a lot of pressure on it will produce Saddam exact synthetic down by ... and I but it is a dynamic exactly arsenal well this is not one we got out of the rounds with what they got out of the ground is always gene not\nMan I\nSong if this reminds me\nOf the want some of the vibrations of all that a futuristic music yes it reminds you kind of sounds like the from the ... but I you know did you know you know why would you know there's a connection\nThey the guy who are they ... they they did the ...\nHe was accused of stealing that show well you know it it is kind of similar ... absolutely I did they ever go to court like yeah I think they did I think they I think there was a ah some some court battles over that sure well I think I did not know that but that was that was a special window 'cause you said you liked that one yeah I like that as I put that together yeah\nAnd you know those guys we're all\nInterconnected of Joe make in a match the nose when he was the I guess you could say one of the first super audio engineers ... and of course the audio engineer is now begun radios begin a\nMusic is big and they all kinds of different things but Joe make he's the one who created all those sounds have you noticed in the in the beginning of pills star hit all that but that negative feedback say on and off each raised except he did that a\nIn a little teeny weeny a upstairs apartment in London that believes in London ... of above some kind of store I think it was like a forget what coastal where it was a but he was a little bit you know he ... he he he ended up committed suicide really yeah but\nThere is that all raised in that little room just went nuts he shot supposedly he shot his job he killed his uh landlady because she was a after him he he was about\nTo win a big loss ... didn't wait long enough he felt so much frustration suppose that each\nShot her because she was about you know just raising cane about some land or rent and they just couldn't hold himself bad did she die oh yeah\nOh yeah oh yeah and so he killed him daily killed himself yeah it is a sad story this tragic because he had he was such a he was so such a genius sort of like a though we lived above a gun stores that what you're yeah anyway\nNo wait rat's nest but he had a gun arrived there one of the is a ... a room mates guns I think it was like oh you haven't had a roommate and the little tiny apparently there yeah yeah fan or you can read about it there's a there was a movie I forget what it was called but it was about\n... and ... and Joe ... ... ... it's a it was a movie back in the eighties I think you can go to YouTube and you can see some stuff about how to check that out\nDo me was a genius ... of it they're all crazy yeah who signed me up there on the borderline there and then of course we were talking a little bit earlier about the uh the inventor of a of a alternating current electricity or the\nWill you know um and you probably know this as we talked about it um\nHe he he came up with direct current right and the way I understand direct current ... is only good for a certain distance right you have to put something in there to boost it up right and it sends that own ... and then you as so sway the further away against the weaker it gets so that wasn't really you know you you had to have a\nI guess they called it a substation on on every block to ... make sure everybody had power well you know test comes along and he comes up with alternating current right like you were talking about ... and uh it uh it uh just revolutionized that he he and Edison worked together for a while\nBut this guy that we've been talking about Tesla he was just so far I head of even Edison no doubt about it he just you know he worked formula Willa think I'm going to go over here see what's\nHappening you know they have had a there was things I think legally against each one of them a whole year you know but here's the thing all of this stuff\nDevelops from a quantum level a lot of people don't I mean we talk about everything is only quantum level you don't really notice it\nI'm supposedly like you and I are sitting here talking we have substance but if we were just really if we could really see everything that was going on in a slow down and then if you and I do not solid\nAnd and those little critters called quantum electrons in quantum photons and quote I'm Adam ... and all this stuff they're they're bouncing all over the place yeah and there's a connection probably of our brains\nThrough micro to ... they say that this was on a theory of to these uh photons electrons which are connected to the universe I'm not\nSo there is a a lot to us being all interconnected if these people say you sound like a crazy man\nMan let me just tell you a lot of people don't Tesla's crazy yeah a lot of people thought that all these these inventors and all these ...\nStein and all these other people Craig's list and it it look look crypto currency people thought that's crazy it came about the next thing that's going to be as quantum currency my friend you're going to have caught the money in the future blaming it'll happen to think about this when I just thought about this yes is this was this is why\nWon't make you think and go ...\n... you know we're here and uh we're we're here right now right and of course we all know where we're going in a in it because we have been ... we've been told we learn from our religious teachings that ... that there's a there's an afterlife there's heaven right and there's hail right and we're all planning on going to happen right but\nWhere do we come from before where we somewhere else think about\nThat for a second we spent nine months in the wound but I don't remember any of it\nThat's the biological part of it but if you really want to get to the quantum thing if you can use it for your religious belief mhm are you can use it for non religious belief which he really doesn't work well for me there the thing is is the reason why I like quantum biology so much\nIs because it shows that we have a choice\nIn other words if you're observing it an electron\nAnd just because you're observing it it it acts like a basket ball hits a background in the mix of the Indian Tyson but when you're not looking at it and then you look at the after effect of it it looks like a wave\nBatman when I looked at it I changed its course which means I'm connected to it there is no doubt in my mind\nThat the double slit a experiment you can go read about it shows that humans in the thought process of humans which is ... quantum entanglement and take them at probably which relates to quantum biology means that we're all connected which means\nA historically in the future as we are always connected which means we will have a stock market correction everybody knows that we're in tangled together we know we feel it in our guts ... we know it's common we just don't know exactly when\nThere will be a huge couldn't a correction probably most of the birds that have predicted this no it\nWere on a wave is total lack of a wave of success a wave of the market going up were riding this ridiculous wave mhm\nBut yet we don't want our particles to come off of it no we're trying to here here's a here's here's a ... I'm kind of like one of those among here say look guys\nWe've gone way high\nList conserve your energy and this can serve your quanta money list conserve your spend ability list conserve your retirement let's conserve your future list don't stay on this had riding waves because somewhere along the line it's going to become spooky\nSpooky size and it's going to change its mind and it's going to go off and then all of a sudden you goes where did buy stuff do\nYou ever wonder if there's like two guys sitting in a room and another dimension doing a radio program office\nThey probably wish we could tuned to me and why they had in mind\nLooked like you and me you've got could be strange if they say that if quantum\nA multi dimensions are true ... I don't know that there are two guys sitting in the room somewhere maybe thousands and millions are ... and instead of talking about quantum mechanics maybe they're talking about\nQuantum ah ducks or something I don't know I mean they say it but there are similarities but they're not quite the same ... so if that's true\nWe don't know now he's just a theory is if the but we do know what goes up comes down and I'm telling you right now and I had to be careful\nIn this dimension [laughter] which other dimensions we're not sure we're not sure I'll tell you one thing I'm sure about was that if you don't want your finances to slip off into another dimension you need to call David Ernest it to seven or seven for three one that's two seven nine seven four three want\nThree three for if you're in another dimension and uh you can check out his Web site at retire with Ernest dot com\nBoom up on Facebook make sure you liked that Facebook page at health and wealth with David artist and on the Facebook page you'll find the link to David YouTube channel some of our programs some funny stuff and I just put some new stuff on there today as a matter of fact\nEarlier this morning while I was in another dimension in about ... over here into this dimension but to make sure your call David today uh I Know I personally know some folks that have a have made contact with him and uh they they were like you know he makes a lot of sense so they could or he could do the same for you\nAnd damned if you get into the fact that twenty four hundred a wall professors or you might as well throw in former Justice John Paul Stevens a leap into this when everything else failed horribly surprises me in and you know there may be a perhaps a dozen quote unquote\nConservative professors among that was going to have not the slightest\nA doubt that if I could jam in that list that it will overwhelmingly skewed to the west\nAnd that's more comment I think on the state of affairs in the legal academy than it is state of affairs about Brett Kavanaugh's temperament\nGuy I think that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turned now Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide\nTurned in that in that follow up here and when when the cabinet or Kevin came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing these I think ridiculous or accusations against him I think he needed to do that\nTo show people he was he was sincere and I and I thought it that that's what happened\nI absolutely agree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and\nWhatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was emotional during her testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling\nYou know person you may or may not think that she that Brett Kavanaugh had done something to her but clearly something had happened to this woman at some point in her life to cause her to be this emotional and I think that of Brett Kavanaugh had come out and said OK I'm here now asked me questions and I'll be happy to answer them\nHe would have been in deep trouble I think the fact that he came out\nExactly as strongly as she did and said you are now trying to destroy a reputation over a lifetime you are also by the way trying to destroy the judiciary by casting doubt about its credibility in the integrity of people who served as judges and I'm not going to play along with this I\nI think that he he very much\nHelped his uh his claws and had he come out and being at a flat aspect\nOr when he would he would have gone down to defeat in terms of you know than his nomination\nWhich talking to Jon Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation jak let's look forward a little bit to talk about some of the things that um [noise]\nUm the Democrats frankly are trying to do one one thing that they're doing is they're talking about the authority of the Supreme Court here are being undermined\nAnd and they're saying that uh decisions in which judge Kavanaugh participates or maybe don't need to be respected if they're close\nThey're talking about if they take the house which everyone seems to think they will I don't know but that's the prediction ah they'll they'll start impeachment proceedings against against judge Kavanaugh what what what do you make of all this [noise]\nTerrible but they are in fact trying to tear down the integrity of the court by making Eighteen or that it's just another political branch of government the Supreme Court hasn't helped felt in that regard because it involved itself in more and more social issues that frankly under the constitution ought to be left to people\nBut you know ... that is what people are trying to do I I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that\nBut ... before the presidential election you had with greater Ginsburg\nComing out and basically saying how awful she thought Donald Trump was and other than a few people grumbling when she actually came around to decide cases over the last two terms involving ... policies nobody was filing a recusal motion to get her\nA to draw way and nobody expressed of the kind of outrage courts her or some outrage but not nearly the level of outrage at your hearing at the beach west towards Brett Kavanaugh who all after all only challenge the tactics of a few senators on the Democratic side of the judiciary\nA committee you know I ... in impeachment is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will certainly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of who they bulk or whether they vote in the mid term election I think if the Democrats do take control\nOf the house it is possible they might impeach Brett Kavanaugh but being very clear impeachment is just leveling of charges and it only requires a majority in the house of representatives after he would be impeached\nAnd then it would move to the Senate just as it did when the house impeach Bill Clinton and then there is a mini trial and it requires a two thirds vote in the Senate\nBefore somebody is actually thrown out of office and there was no way that would ever happen to Brett Kavanaugh so the Democrats might do this they might even filed charges against them if they take control of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh would be thrown off the bench\nNo that's right when we look at the at the crazed behavior not just of the Democratic senators but of the [noise] the Democrats who showed up as as a mob in Washington DC and invaded senators' offices and ... and and all the things that they did attach Rand Paul the airport I may go on and on\nAnd I asked myself why are they so crazed I mean it's really strange and I think at least part of the answer has to do is roe versus Wade I I assume that that that at least part of their thinking is that\nThere was with Kavanaugh's confirmation there now potentially is a ... vote majority on the court\nTo um undo what what many of us continue to regard as one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what do you think about that do you think there's a serious chance of of roe v Wade actually being a overturn [noise]\nReally step back I I certainly think that there are many on the left who are crazed and they had been crazed uh\nEver since ... election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so I think you would get a large amount of this regardless roe versus Wade is certainly a touchstone a lightning rod if you will\nUh for folks are on the left David predicting the demise of roe versus Wade with every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court\nAh starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one and ask Susan Collins pointed out of three people who voted to reaffirm a wrote the opinion that reaffirmed the basics of roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey we're Sandra Day O'Connor David Souter and Anthony Kennedy all Republican appointees\nI don't know of course what the what the current court or would do when roe versus Wade a chief justice Roberts tends to proceed every very cautiously only one current\nAll for roe versus Wade to be revisited overturned my prediction if I had to had to make one is less likely that roe versus Wade will be out right overturned than it will be more restrictions placed on uh the right to have an abortion will will be more likely to be upheld that's\nHow that can come to court over the last few years when Kennedy was there you had states that we have more restrictions or fewer restrictions with respect to abortion rights and the Supreme Court will weigh in on those but in terms of the whole frontal assault on roe versus Wade\nI don't know whether that's going to happen anytime soon and interacting with the chief justice Roberts on the court I have no idea exactly what the outcome would be even if the other quote unquote conservative toward a wallet overturning

party she sent a message saying do you have a condom\nLeah let's just pause on this for a second\nThis is an accidental college Southern California and and they had been on a twenty four hour drinking beer and and\nThis this girl dodges her friends so she can hook up with this guy and they're texting back and forth beforehand and as you said one of the things she Texas okay do you have a condom and he replies yes and she texts back\nGood give me two minutes and so you know the inevitable follows and then after the fact she apparently changes her mind for whatever reason and now claims that this guy raped her I mean it's just unbelievable\nAnd not only did she say do you have a condom and again any guy who's asked if he has a condom is going to show me as willing partner right before she left her dorm room to go down to her ... with this con demise guy uh she sent a message to her friends saying I'm going to have sex\nIt's nothing it's going to perfectly rationally and accurately assume that he has affirmative consent from his partner and yet\nOccidental college who is under enormous pressure from the Obama administration they wanted to rack up as many mail scale as possible and its feminist crusade to basically right males out of out of western civilization uh\nOccidental expelled the guy he's now he's sued the school\nOf that case is yet to be heard but the text message trail is is completely a indicates emitting exonerate them\nYeah yeah there was another one you talk about um where I'm after the encounter which again long after the fact is we characterized as being as being rape\nUh she checks to the to the boy how we're I'm sure the boy checks to her how do I compare with your boyfriend since she replies were great and then of course after the fact she says do I change my mind I think I think it was rape\nYeah well you know these are not just isolated anecdotes as I describe in my book there the very first campus rape survey the one that gave rise to this epidemic of of false claims and that is hysterical\nCompletely counterfactual belief that there's this epidemic of sexual assaults on college campuses\nFirst survey that was published in Nineteen eighty five at its magazine\nA forty three percent of the females homes they rape researcher classified as rape victims went on to have sex again with their alleged assailants now John I submit to you that that is behavior that is completely in on\nThing couple if you have actually been raped you are that is the most as I say the most terrifying experience you can come through you feel nothing but repugnant\nFor from this violent criminal you do not go on to voluntarily have sex again and and the the key to this whole whole\nHoax is that the numbers that we have on alleged campus rape are generated by the researchers themselves the same survey from Nineteen eighty five that was published in this magazine\nWhen the researcher asks the girls who she classified as rape victims whether they had been raped Seventy three percent said they had not so the ... the phony campus rape epidemic a conceit depends on\nIt violating one of the primary norms of feminism which we're seeing it play now with the cabinet hearing which is you always take the female at her word except if she says she hasn't been raped in which case you know better than she does and you declare that she has [noise]\nYou know whether there's this ... this couple of things going on here what is that the left has just redefined the word rape right I mean they've got an ideologically motivated definition that allows them to vastly expand what any normal person would consider to be uh to to be rape\nAnd that they combine that with this with this idea they tried to ram down our throats we saw in the cabinet and hearing\nThat any woman who is complaining must be believe you know you you can scrutinize restore you can't ask whether it matches up with the known facts you can't cross examined her in question are you know you just have to believe and as you may know whether I spent forty years in the courtroom okay\nAnd and I can I can attest from\nWhy you know uh most witnesses or don't lie in almost all witnesses would prefer not to lie but but some witnesses do and I would say that women lie in roughly the same proportion as man and for the same reasons\nAnd and I was this idiot allergy that somehow women are are you know can't you know are always telling the truth is ridiculous\nAgain let's let's go to remember where the ... coming from it is coming from the campus is and it's part of a much broader assault on on western civilization it is based on the idea that that Americans\nIn general and college campuses in particular are places of endemic racism and sexism at the world is divided into permanent\nVictim classes and oppressor classes and it's a very highly competitive world the victim world it is a ruthlessly competitive totem pole\nAt this constantly being rearranged we thought that maybe gauge where at the top now trans people are at the top but they they're put decision there is is is tenuous there's going to be some new victim group I guarantee you in the next year or two that's going to cut claim top\nDog victims status but but females you know we're sort of their early on\nAnd and they claimed that they are victims of rate of sexism this is preposterous it is it is preposterous particularly\nOn college campuses which are open to everybody where females are encouraged\nFrom from the time of girl is five years old today on where she is the in incessant recipient of messages to six feet you know women and spam girls who code\nA courage meant right and left from mainstream foundations from the education establishment it's boys who are in the afterthought who are bombarded with the message\nThat they are at the ... they are the perpetrators of massive oppression you know college campuses give seminars and toxic masculinity at some point males are just going to check out entirely because\nWe are now a culture that is is sending nothing but negative messages that them uh and you know why why bother in a world where everything that you've accomplished is\nIs the value but as you said the court room you know the reason that we that the western tradition developed these truth finding mechanisms like cross examination\nWas with the understanding that human memory is fallible even if the person in tends to be accurate it's very hard to remember things there's implanted memory syndrome that we know about you know we don't know with this Christine Ford Motor therapists was doing to her ...\nTherapists these days are very left wing who knows you know one\n\nThing happened whatsoever\nYeah it's a ... and I think it was probably an eye opener\nTo a lot of people who haven't been following closely the phenomena that you describe other on college campuses that kind of burst into public view here with the accusations against a judge Kavanaugh a but just as the kind of thing that has been going on as you say at our universities for quite a while\nYeah people have to pay attention if if you've got a child going off to college [noise] you'd be well advised to read my book or just educate yourself\nDon't give money to your college anymore unless you've done due diligence and you can be sure that it is not perpetuating the victim ideology\nUh it's not just about the Democratic party that although the Democratic party has now been overtaken by kept its identity politics ... points for civil society it's teaching students they hate\nIt hate each other and I hate the greatest works what civilization uh and they're carrying that animosity into the world at large\nThat's what we're seeing today you know

Chris Hogan asked the audience or three thousand people there how many have you worked when you were in college I mean it's like Ninety percent of the audience raise their hand now maybe the people that didn't work when they're in college and listen to my show I don't know but\nIt appears that most people work when they're in college that's what it looks like and so um I I think if I'm you I'm going to continue that route good question thank you for joining us a ... is with us in Houston Hi Lucia how are you\n[laughter] I Am de la ... [noise] um\nI I gotta tacos here and my husband and I I mean babies that are getting at it that morality aren't you know what you call they ... on them for a down payment on her ... ... ... that we're looking right now at about\nFrequent down here in our household income before I'm On the back and forth about one twenty five I'm after about Mrs cycle it's about\nOne thirty two so I'm trying to make sure that I don't know about like how much how I found that we are understanding the um\n[noise] I I I think you recommend and a fourth of your take home pay exactly ah\nOkay perfect and thought I wanted to make sure that like right now we're paint with a million market calculators and right now we're kind of a funny one from Jerry I'm ... I'm ...\nI'm In terms of like a reasonable comfortable on now and I ... I think number yet there are no it was a big job\nIt's a lot better than you're paying now but if that's that's a form of your take home pay or less and your debt free with your emergency fund and blows you have the mouth spread to prosper if you continue to budget and stay on track the but again that's not what you should do that's the most\nYou should do so you can do less if you want to 'em or you can put it on a shorter term if you want to and you know I'm all\nBy less house at Twenty one hundred and paid off in ten years there's nothing wrong with ... on five years I don't care I mean you can do a lot of stuff but\nThe most I Would ever tell you to do and I I don't even do that 'cause I don't borrow money at all\nFor anything ever is a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay look is one of those in Dallas Hi Luke welcome to the day Ramsey show\n[laughter] Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise] so\nUm my wife and I have a returning to you for many years actually I my dad got me listening to you when I was a young kid and um stupidly I did not take your bike and I had to go it alone and um [noise] we are can dream taking a cash out refinance our house\nTo knock out the high interest loans and then start paying the debt off on the house because it that much lower interest rate [noise]\nAnd how much they want to get your mind certain loan but do you have them read it forty eight thousand okay and what's your household income\nFluctuates between takeover forty to sixty so I own my own business so last year we did sixty five this year we're looking at probably doing I'm probably going to bring home culture to forty two\nOkay I I don't know what you've been listening to on the show but in a twenty six years I've never told someone to refinance cash take care of to pay off their debt ever except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure and you're facing neither\nAnd so on now I I've never told anybody to do that okay and the reason is very simple you make enough money to pay this debt off and a couple of years calm you got to work like a maniac and you're gonna have to have no life\nBut then you're going to be dead free except your house and then you can work on paying off your house I'm from there and of course start working on your retirement and the other baby steps that we walk people through but you can't borrow your way out of debt and on and if you pay this off within two years the interest rate on this becomes mathematically irrelevant\nWhether they're gonna hit it off so fast it's electric keeping it for Thirty years it's a two year thing and and really not forty eight thousand for two years more like twenty thousand for two years because halfway through you're going to be halfway through\nAnd and so yeah you guys need to get on a budget really really tight budget very careful where Donald in touch your lifestyle to nothing do everything you can wear your business to increase your income because you need to clean up a student loan debt I agree with you on that part but no I don't I don't tell\nIn ... in your way out of a whole\nDigging out of a whole is a an oxymoron statement that we all make which I'm digging out of how well you're not digging out of hope you got the bottom of a hole gets deeper dig out of all you have to fill in the hall I get out of ... maybe but you don't dig\nOut of a home unless you dig into China doesn't work so no you can't you can't you can't borrow your way out of that and that's the same exact situation you've got to stop that you have to break that cycle\nOn the sand and say well now borrowing money\nEver ever ever ever ...

for the down payment on ...\nWe want to take her two young children to Disney World should\nWe're currently saving to build her on a new home on property we bought in cash already we can cash flow the trip by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not saving money where's the balance you you're guilty lot aren't you\nI mean you're stuck 'cause you're just going to be guilty you're guilty if you go to Disney and you're going to be guilty if you don't\nYou know what I Do I'll be happy about it either one learn will be guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way you're out of debt you have your emergency fund and you're saving up for expenditures\nOne of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash that some awesome go second one is you want to spend one month so that money and go to Disney about three thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel guilty\nEither way but I'll tell you what I Would do I go to Disney yeah little kids you part is perfect age for that\nIf he is something you obviously do want to do something they want to do um there's not something I Want to do but you it's fine I mean Rachel cruise loves Disney she just took her little baby down there they had a wonderful time not sure how great a term her husband had but they had a great time and I'm\nNow a but but I mean if it's what you want to do you've saved up the money you're not going into debt you're not getting out of debt and going on vacation you're out of that\nYou have your emergency fund this is the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals\nBut I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals\nThen you're not enjoying your life you live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps you're extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans till you're ... out of debt and have your emergency fund in place then you let your foot off the accelerator

years and never upgrade the couch the springs sticking out of it that's when you upgrade the couch you just pay cash for this stuff and you realize that every time we consume something and slows down our long term wealth building but the purpose of long term wealth building has to be able to consume\nAnd to be able to give\nMoney piled up just for pollen ... having a pile of money sake is not worth anything is only worth something when it does something for your family or you're able to do something for others but it's all it's good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave ... thank you for taking my call first time caller sure I'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training and by calling or received my commercial helicopter certificate\nUm however I unfortunately I Need a but by eighty hours or more training I've got discovered a there's an industry is highly regulated by insurance and in order to become a sure why NATO out two hundred hours and I'm trying to\nFigure out how to pay for it was eighty hours and be ready to work the upcoming season I'm as a commercial up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a co pilot and get the hours\nYou know unfortunately a a a a job are there any out but at the single pilot\nAt that moment you just said the wrong thing you said the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida or ... what's wrong\nWell I I didn't tell you another thing or two days I I work at a firefighter so that's my primary um income source is kind of like a secondary thing that I kinda went off in bed and that's a\nKind of why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as a ... ... jobs that I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than ...\nUh no I Believe it or not firefighter you are definitely make ...\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nHe says that's what I Want to do [noise] okay\nUm and so his forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work in their regular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited value\nYeah it's not that I think it's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like I'm like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just I feel I'm I'm too far into who just suggesting\nYou quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except just slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time because I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do the hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job done up to it and it was a child is not worth that much there it doesn't pay that much either\nThat's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're paying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training and the first year\nNo you're right now\nSo not to mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for a place I mean you got connections in the fire department of their life like guys or something that you can get some hours and the co pilot seat and get some takeoffs and landings and get a counselor\nTo lean on for saying those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently find a Robin ... employed by aircraft gotcha\nAnd reached out to people that own their own aircraft and and you know offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get those are generally ... and unfortunately a lot of those guys are very busy so I can get and our air and our there but nothing really calm and\nTo do you're going to end up paying for these hours or does it cost\nWell considering some of the hour and a waste of a you know on the cheap you can get 'em at two ... a a three hundred five hundred it all depends on the aircraft and what kind of a deal you can get you know so\nBecause you know I just won a thirty thousand bucks a a pretty much already my chair and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on just take your time and cash flow it\nBecause you you now have as we continue to in the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level um ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more\nAnd so this is slightly above a hobby yeah yeah definitely ... yeah why not ... I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah I mean I I've got a I I collect handguns and shoot them a lot and uh and\nAnd also I burn through some MOH but it's a panel make any money doing them I'm trying to make money doing it but I was just a hobby and so that costs money hobbies costs are on in this one was not going to cost you money to actually gonna make you a little once you get past this\nBut up until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just going to put another twenty thousand bucks into this thirty thousand much of this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years to cash flow that instead of one you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season want to pay for it in return you promise to work there are three years or something\nLike that you know and they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody looking for a pilot that you know with that much intensity or something I was an employer will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on board if they're having trouble finding the help in that area\nHelps discussion interesting\nThis is the rams when\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend that quick Churchill checkup then just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage\nCan tell you if you could save some cash each month they've helped thousands upon thousands of my listeners keep more cash in their pockets through smarter mortgage\nI Want you to call Churchill for your check up and see if you can lower your monthly payment or better yet she how you can pay off your house or like think about it what could you do with your money if you didn't have a mortgage\nFor the ... the first ones like I was so bad with money growing up for the first month third year maybe kind of kept it just with a ...\nAnd after that my sister who's also here she kind of started asking me questions because she knew I was with money going you know what are you doing it I'd give her all your books because we like the whole library mhm so but uh mentally told my mom and dad\nSo we can get higher later\nThen I Would say his sister and then I'm Brad in the end who told us and then you got to Vegas cheerleader\nSo very very cool very cool congratulations you're gosh Nike is we've got a copy of Chris ... book for you uh retire inspired and that is of course the next chapter in your story for you to be millionaires ran and we got one shopper differing millionaires next chapter being multi millionaires and be given it away I Love it\nSo well done you guys are very very well done congratulations on your are kind of people around here man from Canada [laughter]\nWe're glad you're here man thanks for visiting her liver momentary oh cattle drawn don't care I got to the area a\nAnd Thirteen thousand dollars but it all but three years making Seventy two two hundred counties let Sarah done bringing screw market three two one well [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nOh I thought it was not finding that like\nThere's nothing like that you think about it I think about it if you had been married three years and you end up I\nIt was ... it took me a long time to figure this out all of those smart enough to figure it out as early as they did\nOur endorse local providers are in the top ten percent of agents in their area who know how to spot a quality builder our EL peas can help you navigate decisions wisely and get the most bang for your book they have the heart of a teacher so you never feel lost in the process\nDon't take a risk on your biggest investment get an agent who looks out for you\nVisit day Ramsey dot com slash E.

daughter since then and I'm big fans of each of theirs and we're big fans of course of anyone who's in this millionaire space doing anything\nAnd as you guys know ... million or a book coming out in January but Sarah for law is with us a Tom Standage daughter and a ... this was the first time we've ever talked on the air we topped off the air and she has a new book coming out of being blown when some of her dad's original research so I sort of how are\nYa I'm good how are you having me on well\nI'm honored the new book is called the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth and it it's out this week right\nThat's right yeah and um it was a labor of love and without a father but you know it out and rebel like about it\nYou know if you've got to know her her dad passed in a car wreck or four years ago it was a\nDollar Fifteen that's right yeah I Know we say that\nI'm thinking I remembered that and about and um we had to have him on several times over the years as we discuss this whole subject to millionaires and\nAll of the some of the mythology litters around millionaires so uh you used some of the research from your dad's in Europe are professional researcher to like he was and uh and and I put this together tell me about the background on that part of it what does this or did you do and more of it was combined with what he had done\nYet I think that's a trade had we had worked together really on the initial fair day for the buck um you know really started back in two thousand trial thinking about ... anniversary of the nine ... next door like he came out in the nineties\nAnd and work together on kind of what books should include and got to the point when we were just about to send out a survey on she are than all of a background in American and he was killed by by a drunk driver\n'em and go really he wasn't able to either data that came back and compare it to love affair and Nineteen Ninety six and Andy On I'm sure that's kind of where I took out a chicken product and and kept going with\nSarah is an industrial psychologist and president of data points without a research and\nTechnology company that studies wealth accumulation and builds tools to help and you guys have to check this out its\nUm data points dot com has all the stuff on her research as well but you can get the new book the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth at any major bookstore so the new data that you guys got\nAs you put this back together on the anniversary and then you've added to it since with your continued research\nWhat were the ... or is there anything that just shocked to win the findings where you should go out and see that one coming\nOut you know we went to a lot at I'm gonna take though in that kind of behaviors that money and make related thing and I think what what I mean like\nJust like any but they're trying to do the right thing um millionaires maintenance take you down a lot of that they have very ...\nWas that a lot hasn't things in terms of the kinds of or rather the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that that some of those things are surprising that were sort of similar time\nYeah I was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the\nKey points that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this one to five things you have to do if you want to build wealth is you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become who you are running around with and I see on the back of your book understanding how those around you influence your financial but ... what did you find on that\nYeah absolutely I think that again the it's very clear from the work that we've done both with populations and and the every every day folks like I like\nThat they are um that that that social and different than not caring about what other than driving and buying and wearing their really key factor in building well you know it's related in that were regardless of how old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know now with technology it's really hard to ignore right what other people are doing research for media and so forth but it continues to be a factor are just not hearing about what other people as you know is is is one of the way to go well\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits of going broke what I'd do it in my twenties where his violently was on yellow ... at that point I just reached all I wanted to do survive\nAnd thrive and and I reached a point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people think and I think there was a big contributor\nTo me a personal you'll be able to to build wealth again after going bankrupt but I see it with other people as when you don't care what other people think about what you drive where you live what closure where when you've been on vacation you're not trying to keep up with other people's Facebook version of themselves then you've got the ability to win\nAbsolutely and I think like just like he said I think that that on Facebook Thursday and I live in a lot different right then what's really going on in our lives to something to keep in mind but we definitely see that and the research\nTo gaining knowledge and composer to invest and grow will that is a great word come closer to grow what do you mean by that\n[noise] but you know one study that related to making deter them from that comes to our investments that it really you know you could apply any kind of major financial decision they are making or not or you have kind of Congo before making a decision so I have an example we get sometimes they're\nJust going to rain but not a great time to go out and look for in a car because you're not hearing an emotional state where you are so excited about the new income level that you have all of a sudden your decision making is that if he can stay home and come as\nA matter what the financial nothing bar then you'd have a better chance in the right one\nAnd I I often hear ah we've got a one of ... personality does a career show 'em they're choosing a career and there's all this stuff about following your passion out there\nBut you guys have you found yet again in this new set of data the idea that ate a lifestyle related freedom does not equate to less income or less wealthy it actually equates to ... the new\nYeah you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding that against your passion or your your interests let's say for your career has the ground and I'm kind of reality and and and I think that that's something that\nYou know a lot of people don't want to hear but it is true and so um if you had a passion for the arts and that's really where you want your career to go um you know you have to take that with the reality that mean certain things are going to have to be set aside for\nThat kind of again it's a ... a lot of I don't want to hear but um\nSo there's a price to pay the bill wealth and it's worth the price and nobody does that accidentally they'll do it with a plan\nI lately yeah that that one of the things that we can't hang over and over again and again about millionaires that are on their way to becoming the\nHigher than planning and and looking at your goals and monitoring what's going on in your life and not you know keeping your head and and um that that relate and do they ever time at it in court and go do it while\nWe're talking with Dr Sarah Stanley follow all of 'em I'm I'm pretty much come out in your last night about offsite correctly\nAnd blah blah blah blah blah yeah I'd\nSay like I told me about one on there and I still mess it up there I'm so sorry for the law and a daughter of Dr Tom Stanley a comic work called the millionaire next door a lot of you've read it if you hadn't you should and you need to reach ... new book that she did combined with her dad's\nResearch project that they were working on together when he passed away the new book is called the next millionaire next door it is now out\nAnd you need to read it now you know we've got a book out called a ... called everyday millionaire and let me start if you want to be a millionaire there's not one book you read all of them and you learn from every one of them there's no competition\nThat's where we answer on we've been friends with them for years we'd love that she's got a book outcome in the same year that we do and we want love helping her and we want you to go by this book right now it's called the next millionaire next door Sarah thank you for being with us today thank you so much I mean this is the day Ramsey shot\n[laughter]\n\n\nYou've heard

I. T.\n[noise]\n\nMa'am welcome back to coast to coast we're back with Julie ... her book is called the ghost photographer I loved was the subtitle of course is interesting Julie were you talking about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world and make believe it's coming true isn't it\n[noise] it it it it it definitely is coming true it it it was funny I um when I was sitting with my publisher she was asking me about some of my photographs and I said you know some of the creatures and then that I that I get and these photographs and looked like they ... out of movies that I've marketed\nAnd she goes\nOh my gosh you're living like the real world and may leave I say there isn't that crazy during the day I'm and make believe and then at night\nWho'd comes true it kinda [laughter] have you ever gotten to the point where you were scared or you felt threatened\nYes I did went out the whole time yeah you know and we can start going weird hair in a minute if you want to\nGet some of the things I encountered um are are strange and some are scary and\nYou know I found at times um and and this is where the Claire and Dan really that that gift comes in to come in very handy um where I can feel\nAnd if there is a ... a bad entity an evil entity that is around\nAnd I learned something really important for folks to understand and and\nWhere they have it goes to their house and they feel like they've encountered something and they they feel that fear in their body all they have to do\nIs be in charge because they are in charge because it's the fear\nThat they're looking for and so if you stand there and go get out of my house you are not allowed in here believe you can you say you can use any of the tools that you want but to exert your human dominance like dominance like you\nYou can get rid of most of 'em like that and that's what I found because I started clearing people's homes and I started weirdly because I again my Oklahoma of course I'm upbringing I was raised ... and so I knew the Lord's Prayer hadn't used for really long time um\nAnd did it to work for you\n... what's really interesting is that's another way that I could find if there were um you know dark spirits around as I Would start saying the ... and like I started seeing the Lord's for over and over and if any point in time I forget or I spam or there's something there\nYou're like a magnet it's kind of well maybe [laughter]\nI mean we all are telling the truth was gonna say do you think everybody has ... capability ... or ... or are you an usual\nYou know I think that we're all born with different gift that we're able to tap into Josh\nI have a friend that is the most incredible medium you will ever meet in your life and the specificity of the messages that she gets from the other side are detailed as addresses that you've lived in in your life\nWhen from the number of into the street name so I think everybody has something different you know it perhaps I have\nYou know a ... few weird capabilities in in in in the world so yeah I think probably I Do\nYou actually because you're into of course media in a big way Mm you Google ghosts when you were experiencing this how come\n[noise] you know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right and you were kind of becomes your reality you want to see the ... you want to know you're not the only one and I think I was looking to see how\nCommon are uncommon right physically the photograph did you get the answers um I started\nTo I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about if that really kind of ease my nerves and then\nAnd then of course I turned to the movies and there are some really fabulous movies that are based on true counts and one of them is that movie the witch and did you do you ever see the which\nI have not seen you haven't seen much there was a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like before the sandwich shop and\nI'm\nJamie ... who is the kind of friend of mine who's a producer and and and he did a lot of work at the New York public library pulling you know an original pamphlets from back in the day and there's a scene where the father\nOr the and families circled around I'm the son who is um a possessed and he says everybody must say the Lord's Prayer\nFor they'll start saying the Lord's Prayer then the two twins are saying it and then they fall on the floor and kind of start shaking\nUm because there was a there was a a like a evil\nIt's like oh yeah that's the Lord's Prayer is how we like uh the mining rod to find them to know and\nAnd I'm like oh my gosh that's been happening to me\nSo it's weird how things happen without instructions\nI think that's a really interesting part about all of this\nIs that all this this happened to me and there was no instruction book and I was able to identify were goes to war I was able to figure out how to get them out of his space I'm I was able to figure out how to help other humans\nUm protect themselves and you\nKnow big thing I learned a lot about sleep paralysis\nIn but there's nothing ... about that or is there for you well it was just like the ... syndrome\nI did for a little bit on this\nWell he could be medical\nIt could be could\nBe people woken up it relies basically because they can't move ... syndrome and then you realize you know you knew you are where you can you get out of it but I've also heard of the old ... syndrome where you were basically paralyzed\nYeah what I've heard what I read about in well actually what I I experience I I didn't personally experience it um but I have a very close friend and this is how it all started that he was telling me histories of fleet paralysis and um and there's a an entity called the ... man\nYes you know highly ...

and have all the ballot in November and um it was it was awesome it was awesome to watch him do his thing it really what\nThey seem to have a love fest going on so I I don't see any blood bad blood between Nikki Haley and President Trump at all\nNot at all not at all I I think that uh you know the way she was talking that she's put our ten years in and she needs to take a break and that you know she wants to help him in the next election thousand twenty\nYou know I\nThat part was clear she's clearly going to to help the president then they they did not seem to have any bad blood whatsoever\nNot at all not at all I mean it was praising him talking about what an honor why\nLet me and she's been a governor for six years and then the UN ambassador for two years basically to go to the world peace and he'll round the for and fought with all these lunatics and uh I mean there's got to be Tyrone kid and you can imagine I mean\nSouth Carolina has had a simultaneously Jim demand and Lindsey Graham elected the same time so you can only imagine what the Republican Party like back home she had to do that for six years\nRight you know and then and then I had to go to the UN and and babysit those foods\nRight so yeah I I don't get an excellent job as well I don't I don't blame you for wanting to to to write off into the sunset\nAnd and it's not immediately she's gonna wait 'til the end of the year but it was just brilliant that they did it now\n... tell me generally then again why is it really to do now\nOkay we're about to have elections in November\nAnd how does this benefit a Trump in the elections\nBecause she was talking about how positive everything what she brought up the un how strong the United states is with Trump and and like\nYou know but the ... elections for weeks from today people don't forget she said it wasn't for weeks months will be like two hundred years\nI don't know but if there's like a new if there's like a new message every day because Trump\nAnd there I Know there's some great rally where the next day they talk about the rally and how right in and all of the excerpts from his speeches where he saying we're not taking crap off these Third Reich countries any more and\nAnd then talking about how we support law enforcement and how we picked a conservative for this right I mean his message between now and election is going to do nothing but get people fired up at least on our side\nAnd then saying every single them out there how wonderful the government in the United states and doing all of them are there and they had to sit there and they were all that kind of come out\nAnd everything that they are not talked about how how the United states now have Thanksgiving [noise]\nWaco now for ... thank you so much I don't there's no doubt of Nikki Haley's ability to speak and to be nice about its spin but I don't know I mean the timing I don't think I'd I don't get the timing with the election thing yeah I don't I'm not buying the timing or I think\nThis is more of a\nYou know he was going to leak out Trump doesn't want to leaking out so you might as well go ahead and have the announcement that way you didn't have to deal with all the speculation of I mean basically the announcement broke and forty five minutes later they were having a press conference they didn't have to deal with all the speculation of\nOh there's trouble in paradise oh look at the trough misery and all the White House in chaos and all that but no they got it out not to the next\nYou know so once she decided she was going to do it she has to start telling people\nIn the office and then it's going to leak out so you might as well not I think that's more what had to do with the timing more than anything else\nProbably but it

I'll be now how why\nDidn't do it from like the equal justice initiative ... ... you know Brian Stevenson\nGreat structures up there and probably cause that kind of shows yeah but if you do it from the king memorial think what'd you your backdrop is they're not going to use the churches the backdrop they'll use it eases ... drop or no drop\nThey'll just say that that's where they are then they'll use it in the role as they go but the backdrop\nWill either be the capital or all the way down the extra that historic down next to where the money was going to ... that's a much better backdrop than the age I ha I memorial which is this is fine looking up and over that's nice but what I mean what's your surrounding neighborhood that is true that is true\nYou know [noise] um so I mean if you're just looking at framing the the screen shot for NBC News it's a better look from Dexter\nAre but there are some road closures in Montgomery a Tuesday all day so if you're down there you already know there's been a whole streets closed Decatur streets glowed Bainbridge and Dexter all closed in various places or how did how did you get down town Lawrence I uh Madison lawns in our our our core yeah yeah the only two going that way towards the interesting\nUm but anyway he'll be here to be here all day five thirty PM NBC nightly news broadcast live from in front of the historic Dexter avenue\nKing memorial Baptist church so I'm I'm I'm all for now I'm I'm I'm hoping that I think it's a great welcome I Hope everybody's nice to them I Hope uh out the backdrop looks amazing and spectacular and clean and pretty like it is\nFor daily after it's cooler yeah well after daylight savings time changed and it could get it would be dark that capital it's beautiful there really is and we any more just stayed kept we do\nI've seen a lot of state Capitol some are very average ours is really a beautiful beautiful building and number two seven to nine to ... who is this\nGoing well Gordon how are you seeing your pot you're doing well\nDo something on TV last night as a matter of disturbing those military man said when the spirit is still out there now they don't mind the family because those problems we have it in my ... I heard that too and that's not ... not good [noise]\nOut where to like to hear more college people are here for you know I don't know a year oh hell I thought I was talking about the fact that they don't bring their families because our education system is so bad\nThat's right and that's not good no sooner or later box you know it's going to do something about that I don't know well they walk the walk to the people that have the fans are scrambling\nTo they can live on base or they can also live in the surrounding community we tonka or ... or pike road um but yeah it's a it's tough it's it's it's certainly\nDoes advantageous but look at some of the other bases around the country where they are located\nI Try to case in Fayetteville North Carolina one time Fort Bragg\nGosh and I got there and it was a long time we were there for gosh I don't know a couple of weeks\nAnd I got there and um after about the third or fourth day I'm not gonna say your name but the the kept it out you get a ... when you're a lawyer like they get assigned to somebody the cap and I was assigned to last year we were driving from the hotels are the base and I asked her I said show me the good part of the ... bill\nI mean all this dumpy area and say they'll show me where the nice part of the village and she looked at me with a dead set expression like dead serious expression are you kidding\nAnd I said no she said you don't know much about say they'll do you I said no license there is no good part of the bill this is the good part of the ... all I sell is like strip clubs in broken windows in crumbling buildings that was it I mean for whatever reason\nWhen you put a military base somewhere it basically annihilate the surrounding area\nAnd Maxwell is no different ... and frankly gun there is no different and I I'm not sure why that is because you would think you have a lot of responsible respectable people who show up in uniform guy all business when they get the job done to get out of there but but really a lot of these people make very little more than subsistence pay\nYou know they they barely can survive and so they don't have a lot of disposable income to promote the economy's immediately surrounding the base and things kind of go to pot\nUm their reasons for coming on the company rules the people that are coming here to stay for three years to her okay that makes him and the and those people that come in for three or two we're going to move places like ... bill or someplace where they think okay the better school systems\nI think well yeah and I know you've got the she was going to be here for a year would necessarily uprooted family come here and then that makes a lot of sense\nIt was on that fitness true in all cases the hungry decision but it's frequently true is that it gives you get a guy that got Nineteen Eighteen Nineteen years then you've got kids in high school\nYeah makes sense makes those same version of dying they push it or don't didn't sound like he's a local until now many more than I think you were talking yeah I think he did too but I mean it for him good for him I like to read to\nCome down town\nBut it's not like you know where you work in these days you got to be in the middle of you've got to be in the middle of nowhere two days in a row\nHere you can be\nI don't know if you're not 'cause I'm In the middle of nowhere all\nYour clothes are [laughter]\nI just passed restaurant called it don't matter if\nYou're in Holland in Alabama ... ah yeah on\nThree thirty one I haven't been that don't matter what's going on\nAnd it's a great time for restaurant but anyway yeah I was talking about the uh uh not wanting to calm because the school that last caller made a good point I hadn't really thought about that I Would or operate your kids from school you know I I thought about that but\nYou're absolutely right about the surrounding areas around a military base is when you started talking about that what popped into my mind was pay a bill\nYeah Spain has done oh\nIt is an absolute dumb and let me tell you some of our most elite soldiers are stationed in saying that\nAt Fort Bragg or pope air force base which is the other side of Fort Bragg yeah uh yeah uh and and one that I was a Spanish now for a little while and yes I'm Serious theme or Johnston\nHey I've got a great the more jobs in store down after I had I had to defend the guys seem more Johnson called me and they say hey we got a new case for you here's where you're going to be going in Goldsboro North Carolina for you and I said how far away as then\nThey say there's probably twelve hours where you are saying okay so do you want me range of flight is now driving cars that if it's under Fifteen hours I'll drive so I said I'll drive and I'll do\nIt in one day I'll just get up early and get their that evening and we'll get to work the next day you know just you know give me one extra day hotel okay good um so I said oh by the way what's the name of the base\nYeah OK in it and he says it seemed more Johnson\nAnd I just got real quiet I said don't ask me I said don't with me [laughter]\nAnd he said no no it's similar Johnson is seriously don't with me I just tell me the name of the base he said I'm telling you man don't don't say anything when you get here because they're sensitive about it [laughter] because the more Johnson apparently was a true war hero\nYeah yeah yeah and so they made a base after him because he was such a bad as but yeah you could that you cannot have a worst base to be assigned age sex assault case until you got to travel there I actually went there are two or three times and the case settled one time\nOn my way to see more Johnson and I got like an hour away I had to come right back [laughter]\nAnd like I spend the night and turn around and come right back\nYeah and and oh they they are the hotel accommodations and Goldsboro just an outstanding right\nUh I think that the Hampton every time there was a Hampton um you know it had liquor stores across the street [laughter] I mean there there were two restaurants basically there was a\nChain restaurant I'm not going to mention by name and then there was this place called east coast we had sandwiches or whatever wings or whatever and it was right outside\nThe gate and that was that was pretty much it\nAnd it's talk buy here pay here you got a lot of farmers yeah and that's that's that's what it is\nAnd I told them if I was going to come back for the week for the trial is gonna stay in the room where I can actually like eat something decent and then you can exactly\nExactly yeah yeah yeah yeah\nYeah yeah but I'm Glad you recognize that that the area around the bases are dumps especially oh yeah ... actually wasn't as dumping some of the places where\nI'm Talking about the did you ever go out to ...\nUh never went out to bag no\nOh man [laughter]\nYou know I I'm civilians unlimited where I can go\nOh yeah yeah that's right but uh yeah in fact it was a while back for a reason OK [laughter]\nHave you ever been to twenty nine palms I had to try and case out there one time I Know I haven't okay dump on top of dumping the middle of a desert so yeah and in a hotel I stayed in it is\nI get them to get the lizards out of the room before her I put myself down I walked in there or lizards or where can you come out with the lizards out\nWell I'm a truck driver so lived there for a little bit different from you know we we deal with the lizards but\nNah never uttered those lizards were not in my room as a family show William [laughter] okay I I really appreciate that and I sat on law\n\nAnd this is far fetched you know a lot of people have heartburn over my pants yeah main father right didn't Trump right what if Trump picks Nikki has to be VP I think that would be a mistake why do you say that it's a woman you don't change well respected\nIt would do you so much chaos they can't even keep a vice president around\nYeah no I mean unless ... turns out to be a traitor or something\nI don't think he is I mean he's on the team but you know\nThink he is safety for the president because the left and you don't want to take out Trump to get depends no because he'll be worse on on social issues and everything else for them or someone I it is not an original thought to me but it's certainly an interesting prospect Nikki Haley resigns as UN ambassador\nCampaigns for Donald Trump and the Republican ticket in twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty and then going into the um\nTwenty twenty or twenty Twenty one term Lindsey Graham is appointed to either defense secretary or or somewhere he wants to serve in the cabinet and Nikki Haley is appointed to his seat by the governor\nIt was interesting merry go round I've heard yet as to what she may be up too but we'll see to seven to nine to ... who's this\nHow we want to gain one more time Romney how are you may go\nJust by you know we're talking about the prices you know again you\nAre you I have is a matter of fact I'm actually a random may for Florida hold on hold on let me start with the Virginia when uh\nI've been into a ... what's the base up there by hand and uh what's it called\nGot a and I asked Oceana\nNo it's a it's an army opposed a it's called um\nOr story board lady\nI Can't remember but it's in it's basically in in Hampton, Virginia it's it's a\nYeah it's a ... ... yeah okay it's it's worse than probably they're the ones we've names and for\n... here's fine\nThanks young guys basically back when they had the draft you know you're Eighteen Nineteen years old you said you're from Alabama was punished by sheer bans Panama City or\nSix Flags over George or something now you're in boot camp you get out of boot camp and you get stationed in one of these places you don't make much money but you're going to get off bikes you can get drunk on bikes but not off bikes and then you go out there and you do with the dirt bikes\nAnd and they make a lot of money you know I mean you you're ... years old you ain't never been nowhere\nSo you don't you don't know how to behave is what you're saying and they tear up the community\nNow that don't share of the community that want to have all these\nOh I understand is the trust before him stripped shop so yeah I understand\nThe need for strip shops around a a base I get that and I understand why that's where the are probably the red light district in Montgomery is located right out the gate I understand that\nI don't know anything about what I think far from the get

I mean you could almost now look at a ... of a chart of the FBI me like oh look at all the people the top and what they did\nNow that's the way to explain to me\nThe timing of today with Nikki Haley ... because what happens is you have the kind of in a story you Nikki Haley story out there\nAnd then bam this thing drops tomorrow and it's not going to be a little bit tomorrow but it's gonna be it's going to be at peace isn't being bored and then you got nobody's talking about having a nobody talking about hey they they're talking about this who yeah Nikki\nHaley's almost like a pallet cleanser like she's not going anywhere until the end of the year and he's the shirt\nYeah exactly [laughter] before your nose or [laughter] new senator who report one demo show will be back right after this break\n[noise]\nYour news off place to be a ... show on the news talk ... only one or the lazy [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nI think the ... the whole thing to do that [noise] the boom\nBoom boom eating [noise]\nWell he was in the room and he never said anything ... it was just zero here's the nominee and he just didn't say anything and he goes to Oxford and looks dopey walking around the state and I'm remembering\nAlso like he wanted a pause in the\nCampaign yeah ... ... they have put opposing the campaign and then they had they did oppose under debate then he went to the White House and then\nTwo days later he goes you know the debate zone are going to do that by 'cause we announced it in the show because we knew where inside sewers and that girl and um we put it out that he's into the debate and then sure enough\nLike that night or the next morning he said that and then he went up there and just boxes debate is his own downhill from there is from six points up to poor boys that\nOne vote just remember a delight to your early twenties Fifteen if people you're Donald Trump's going to be the next president [laughter] people laugh in your face when I was in the ... or whatever so who knows\nLewis a kind of get into some of the midterms are when you get an update of um the midterms from real clear\nSome key senators on the cabinet confirmation already feeling the heat from their votes New York magazine urging red state Democrats they can do better than Joe mansion CNN claims Heidi Heitkamp may lose her seat after the cabinet vote and according to Newsmax Kavanaugh boost Republican effort to unseat\nMissouri's Claire McCaskill and even for Republican senators feeling the heat talking points mellow claiming Alaska Republican Party ways reprimanded Lisa Murkowski for opposing judge capping off\nHere to weigh in is the president's a real clear politics Tom Bowman joins us from Chicago we would know we knew there was going to be fallout\nFor each and every vote somebody talking now it looks like a we're starting to talk about that a little more seriously yeah certainly the\nThe Kavanaugh fight has certainly a throne rent share into the political landscape and seems to be by and large are really helping Republicans I mean if you look at\nSome of these red states that have a lot more Republicans and Democrats um the base has been activated in those states and we've seen that bear out in the numbers in North Dakota for example Heidi Heitkamp\nWe've seen a bear out in Tennessee Marsha Blackburn the last two calls have been taken there have her up a you know getting some separation from Phil Bredesen bomb and we're waiting to see how it's how it will affect these other centers like Joe Donnelly in Indiana Jon Tester of Montana and you mentioned Claire McCaskill Missouri all three are I'm very very tight races\nHere um he was an interesting thing Mencken\nWho voted for cabinet now the Democrats who have said in West Virginia the Democrats are upset in West Virginia has said that they weren't going to go out and vote for him\n...\nThat would be that could be a problem\nNot that they're a tone of Democrats with a ... ... it depends on what percentage of if you have that doesn't take that many though to swing those numbers into the Republican so it would be interesting to save a snapshot polish taken it said we've got some people in a copy their their copying in a big copier room listening to a\nTo to show\nThat they want to join and do those things are bad as a way and there's a wind up there but it's ah\nThere were there and joined a doing this as mentioned gets re elected as just become a Republican and I think that was so close to my mind today protect them when I heard that so he sneaks six senators saying Democrats poo poo on him and then they were bubble can pick up seats and he would be in addition\nTo that ... I think it'd be very comfortable with it\nAnd he kind of seems like a Trump Republican it does it really does I like that so they continue on with the uh mid term update this too will clear potatoes guy now he's going to tell you who he thinks this is benefiting what now\nWhat do you think of the president's mass messaging going forward is going to be regarding to keep keep people reminded of the cabinet battle\nUnfortunately I think I think is going to mention all of his rallies and Republicans are going to mention it they're going to keep the pressure on Democrats on this issue through the election because the question now is Republican intensity has risen to match that of the Democrats\nAnd a lot of these surveys and the question is whether it's sustainable whether it's sustained through over the next four weeks or election there whether it dissipates because Kavanaugh did when he er he's confirmed he's on the court now so I'm walk to wait and see whether Republicans can maintain that intensity\nOr not sure and that's important because it's time to go back six months and it looks like there was going to be a blue wave sweeping across America of one month from today but now\nNot so much right [noise] it certainly seems like as I said\nDays we've seen the generic ballot number close Democrats lead went down from over seven points about six and a half points now I mentioned some of the Senate numbers were saying we're also seeing some of the races shift\nIn the house in favor Republicans with the number of a tossup states has gone down the number of Republican leaning Republican seats has gone up for it I'm just over the last seven days so at least right now it seems like it's benefitting is benefiting Republican\nSo alternately while it may benefit Republicans right now you know Republicans are going to vote for Republicans and Democrats for Democrats the independence and who are they going to break for\nThat is the big question how this is going to affect independence and right now again independents particularly in mid term is very very small slice of the electorate we've got conflicting data on folks they said you know they they weren't really in favor\nA favorable rating of Kavanaugh but on the other hand they thought he was treated unfairly I'm so we'll have to wait and see what independent in some of these really close race as can be very very decisive\nOkay I'm going to use terminology here that uh I think is exactly what's going on and that's my quo messaging\nAnd if we take the ordered that the cabinet oh thing was the deal that got the Republicans were energized particularly in places like Montana North Dakota Tennessee Indiana Texas we paid ... and um Arizona and then about it\nSo all of a sudden\nTrump is going to be going to these red states said he used as very very well in the media in kind of given him to shake type thing there and so they can run out the talking cabinet all\nBut he goes to the stage that he's talking Kevin out and now he's talking about the corruption at the highest boys a department of justice in cahoots with the Democrats and the Democrats said or end up as don't didn't ever care to find out what the truth was\nThat is a powerful micro message to be looking at the stage\nI've very powerful message so he goes there and he does a forty minute rally goes in and helps a member of Congress or ... or ... proposal a U.S senator and jokes about Kevin Oh and the fact that done and they voted against it\nAnd only wouldn't do anything because of this investigation and kept talking worked inclusion when there was no rush inclusion and they would never investigate this stuff\nI think that is the way this thing's going to go down I think that Trump remember kept saying that\nTrump was waiting on either a particular time or in a bit to occur which would always do that with the Kevin Oh getting voted in ... and so that happened and here we are\nI think it's you know as they said tomorrow when I get the first piece of this thing he changed the ... the the storyline with Haley and these were setting it up with this and then going back and the micro message to each of these states whom Kevin ...\nWhere do you think\nIt's about the right time and was in a month away no more legislative agenda for weeks\nToday new shown any to report one they're more show will be back right after this\nAnd\n\nMore is you know\nTo do\nWell tell me\n\n\n\nNo\nOne\n\nNo one would be no\n[noise]\nAnd ... to go out\n\n\n\nChevrolet Master control center says is W.

a state\nIt because it in space about just federal government and didn't separate state government or from federal government to them and will be an interesting one and this is where I think having a

hate that also to help political the court has become because in college I brushed up a little bit with reading Supreme Court rulings and like their opinions and the ...\nAnd it is it's complicated it's fascinating that a lot of issues in the law or not as clear cut and that's why it's at the Supreme Court level\nAnd I appreciate those and sometimes I think we get to go up on the the banner ruling obviously because they are important but uh we do a disservice to how difficult some of these things can be\nNo discussion about John is going to say something to this clip that I think is very

surprise some people now that he's totally liberated from the politics that uh that got him there but if they're going to drag this thing through the night at twenty Nineteen and into the twenty

opinions showing how nine\nTrying issue angel Russian yeah well and then you can have a unanimous decision but you have them write different opinions saying well I came to this final conclusion a different way and it leaves the room for growth than later court opinion I\nI like the Supreme Court from just the basic sense of it is one of the few things in this country that is a completely democratic at this point I mean little democratic\nI think the founders really got that right with the bill of rights and with the legal system and independent judiciary and we too often in this country get all about once a public opinion one of the people think and I think we're putting it doesn't matter yeah like when he was just because something's popular doesn't mean it's true\nWell in our problem is is the way the way we're white laws we white well on the political bases and not understanding the impact of it is one reason I like\nThe Brubeck grew so much is he clearly understand

if that is possible then they were before uh so I Would look for them to continue to threaten continued investigation if they are managed to win one house of uh of Congress and the midterm sex lot\nWhy in your view are they matter is it because of the president's proclamation that Kevin always innocent\nWhile they felt it was ... that they were kind of rubbing it in a it was a very very uh motion all and hard fought fight and\nUh they felt that the president did not take the high road but again they almost always feel that way about President Trump but it was clearly a a moment of intense victory or not just for Cabot Lodge out and just for President Trump but also from Mitch McConnell the Senate Republicans who's hung together to make this happen\nNow let me tell you some and they think they're going to impeach Kevin Oh there are there's a pipe dream and they may vote for impeachment of the house if they've got a unified or they when they have a unified front is no way in the world that ever happened in the Senate\nParticularly if he's flip over some of these things have just imagine\nThe Corker going ... most of ... or by burn you you moving why years ahead as far as

pressed is now sort of coming out into the open now I don't want to sugarcoat it in words\nThere's also a lot of weird crap the Internet for instance has unleashed because of the Internet has had a fear of the Internet but it you know back to what I opened up the show with very shortly and we're with Rick in ... when you're doing this anniversary thing again what is the day is October twelve\nWhich is this Friday friday or the the doors open to the store at ten am friday so we've got a huge sale a that goes all day it's ten percent off all single cards of any kind in store a\nTen percent off of all the toys and statues in store\nHalf off all back issues in store and reason I keep saying in stores we have a lot of things on line right that sale doesn't apply to\nBut we have hundreds and hundreds of toys and thousands of comic books\nThat are going on sale the toys are anywhere from fifty to Seventy five percent off we've got two dollar bands and then we've got thousands of dollar comic book so that's all day friday an all day Saturday there's a special around the Ford lot between four and five the Rick mobility rolling in and it'll stay till eight o'clock\nAnd they're supposed to have specific merchandise just to the ... um ... you know of course I'm shining a light on ... kind of exclusive it's that you know and that's what I was talking about on Saturday with Jane is\nYou don't just call up and get the ... you have to kind of have a little bit of weight behind your average rent and that's one of the things with all this time in the business that Brent has built\nA you know he's got a very successful online business and put successful brick and mortar in that I have ... you know some opportunities that obviously you otherwise would not have so it's a pretty big deal for us we just reversed\nPercent of our inventories Ansel literally to try to move it out because we had to eliminate fixtures and create space for our growing magic players and for our a growing new comics I mean you know you some something's got to go with something else is coming in so\nWell and I just um I don't I'm not as a ... there are certain people who are fans into their fans fry and that's one of those shows I think it's ... kind of a cold around in a good way I mean that they told\nUs to expect and I said they said based on the city or size expect two thousand three thousand people now I don't see that happening but we're going to prepare for it you know as much as we\nCan I mean I Would consider myself a casual fan in in a ... because like I've consumed a lot of television and a lot of online material that show is one that is incredibly refreshing given all the crap that's after the watch corrupted I Love\nThat I enjoy that show never fails to kind of gave me a mind death\nLike it just kind of asked me in the head but it's also very funny rap and in dark in the type of humor that dark and a little bit messed up at times and it makes you don't like it you think about it it's darker is hard to ride on the grounds that it's just not to watch it right\nLike a car wreck exactly yeah you want to you want to see what happens but you also don't want to you don't want to look away but you want to look away\nWell and it reminds me when I tried to describe brick and mortar to somebody who's never seen it's like I'm trying to describe wrestling again to somebody was never really got into it you have to see the pickle ... episode we've got to see this out take a\nCity king of that we just going to go ahead and say we're not going to have any ... sauce please don't show up [laughter]\nFor folks who don't know that was featured I Can't remember what episode in this but and it was long been not a big Donald ... central and saw some McDonalds and move on you know well yeah like in the late nineties and so they brought it back\nBecause of Rick I'm already but they ... they they it was ironic but none of the call anything\nAnd then ironically they were making fun of the fact that they ran out and people had sold some I think somebody sold them for like a million dollars\nAnd that's the ironically tried to bring it back and then they did bring it back and ironically the fans\nAlmost beat each other death over right because it right\nAway and that's got to be interesting ... a line of work where I'm sure there are certain things certain items that it is every especially something like collecting it's subjective it's like what are you going to value the most and what does it work and get a bear but when it's like a one of the kind of an item\nOn a ... what's the marketing of beer really can come down to what is one person willing to pay like that one fanatic\nI can give you a good example because I haven't uh I've just started their few weeks ago and so I haven't experienced this from the shot perspective but ah Britain had a comic I guess about four or five years ago\nAnd the there was much dickering and I want to say maybe it was a Spiderman number one in a very high grade like a seven point five ... great for the listeners who don't know it's a one to ten scale\nOnce you get to nine it breaks down in points by increments of to once you get the aid goes nine eight nine nine ten oh you don't see nine nine and ... those those are purple unicorns nine eight is very uncommon for gold and silver age which is the oldest books\nSo he has this age does Spiderman amazing Spiderman number one ... which at the time was probably sixty thousand dollar book and it's like I said five or six years ago and uh the sixty thousand was the latest going numbers of people were going buys a God well you know burnt said I'm not summit for less than a hundred thousand dollar threat\nIn cars where you're gonna go find NATO's you just don't find it\nThat's goes by and he says you know it's a hundred and five thousand the guy's like oh my God when he died but he said I you know amongst has gone by and and I've had other offers I've turned down\nSo the guy literally buys it for a hundred and five thousand that grain and now it's a three hundred and fifty thousand ... yeah so you know you you you get that situation where yeah you've got to go buy 'em an action comics number one which is a good deal older than Spiderman number one\nCause the Spiderman number one without being too convoluted was not the first to parents were Spiderman action comics number one is the first two parents of Superman and know that sold and twenty sixteen for three point two million dollars in nine oh conditions so\n... I I don't know I guess what we're talking about is kind of it's what modern culture has become but in a really good well people will sit and will you'll see these things pieces about the materialism and\nThe post modern world and stuff like everything's a copy of a copy of a copy so depressing and him\nAnd blame but now I mean the part of me is like what you're talking about it reminds me of like the car world and how they auction off fish the cars where else do you get okay you get kind of think sports like pressure wrestling get actual sports memorabilia\nYou get into other types of games that I think we'll probably over take at you know physical sport\nAs we go into the future with video gamer card games and how is it that in this one place online or the brick and mortar you're getting all these worlds that don't seem to be related or related way they function whether it's their markets\nOr it's the passion that people that are involved in these things and I can't think of any other\nTime in human history where you've had this ... against because of the Internet I mean when you've always at markets in the bazaar and these sort of things but it's pretty remarkable when I realize the depth of how all these things overlap\nUm no I Wanna be also get into kind of worry all began like why you say a hundred and you just graduated right why did you jump into this world like it was just ...\nYeah uh I guess in high school you know I really I really wasn't doozy asked about games and I played magic and things like that um I went to college and I you know changed majors once or twice and ended up with music or you know when it ended up going in for music degree\nA finished my degree and I mean to a crowded market you know with with teachers everywhere and\nAll these extra things you need to be a teacher now I was unable to really get you know what I was looking for there but\nUm you know with my other things gaming I ended up finding a job the game stop I ended up working there for four years for a you know come out of that great and then I met you know leave was one of my customers against off and was like you know man you know about magic and I was like yeah yeah I you know I get it you know I I played for seven or eight years he's like well I think I Know this guy that\nMight need somebody that's like a manager for gaming and I was like you know that that sounds like something I'd want to do I mean you know uh I can go for music to business sounds good to me [laughter]\nYou know I got bills to pay to so right and uh we're doing it man it's I've been there about three months now and I'm loving it you know every day I go into work and I know\nA hey these are my expectations but it's not a big corporation if I mess up and go hey Brent hey man I'm Sorry you know there have been messed up and I'm not there's not ... you know it's not that close like right now you really look\nIt [laughter] so Britain had uh some things on his girls out of a school today and uh he had a previous engagement and he's like hey why don't you ask her to go and I let it be a great idea you know the world's getting ready to if you worked for a corporation or I'll take your a three month and blowing go to the radio station and do a show\nThere was an open house this weekend [noise]\nBoth days to insult or [noise] or\nZero six she will boulevard [noise]\nHe can register for a gift card they'll give away between those two hours both days\nFour bedroom two bath two car garage large sun porch located within walking distance of everything you need to be an ...\nPopular might've been second best Wagner yeah that's an obscure reference for all you've country bumped ... out there all your ... an asset thank you for listening [noise]\nWhat any ... not second best any better is the\nBest to go above and beyond so give him a call three two two zero six six to visit the good soon group dot com or go by the open house again this Saturday and Sunday both days two to four in the afternoon for zero six Sheila boulevard\nWell folks we've got a break we'll be right back after this [noise]\nOh\n\nLive regions most trusted voice for news end up being in a dream one at Sam's W.
