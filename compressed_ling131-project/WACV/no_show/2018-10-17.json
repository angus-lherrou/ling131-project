I just add something about me and banana and and I don't think you'd find it very much probably they will do that a peanut butter and bacon sandwich I might do that but that was one that I just can't who bananas\nDoctor told me eat bananas those things that appeal as well you know bananas have potassium address right but there's gotta lotta sugar and I'm too yeah so there could be some part of your body says they don't really like this is my mouth that says they don't lock them at a waste of consistency and I just I don't know what it is not as ...\nWell I Hope I don't die not knowing\nYou don't mind I don't not knowing what am I managed to stay so I Know what they taste like I just don't like that to happen that often I St Peter for going you could you tell me why didn't lock but now it may be he'll know maybe I'll look it up and he's got that book you know a rabbi in there yeah yeah exactly I Hope I don't keep me out\nNow they will they will they'll let you read on the ... nothing really gay barely thou shalt eat the banana or not pass without a doubt you'll be like just chicken you know we're\nSo history repeats itself what this shows about ... you know uh\nIt it does it does repeat itself over and over and over and the first part I think of this show we had that news flash yeah and uh it reminded me of a you know seeing these old reel to reel is in a lot of\nThese flash kind of things and uh\nEvery time I hear that I think of the the big blue blue a hand in bird yeah oh the ... and oh the humanity of it and you know in what I think of that thing blowing up I always think of the stock market when it's blowing up like a balloon explodes and burns down and\nOh the humanity of all the retirement accounts just go in fall into the ground and people crying and we've been saying oh we've had only done something before this had happened if only I had a parachute if only I had not gotten on that bad\nHistorical wave if only if only I had done it before it was too late ... that's the message today the message is\nFran please look at look at the wave is going on it's going to go on maybe for a while may be wrong maybe it won't fall maybe\nIt'll just fewer our our flatten out ... but how in the I'm not saying that camp but I just don't see how\nThis kind of thing can ... I don't see it right I don't see to me it's scary and I'm afraid history is definitely going to repeat itself bad bad way I'm fully in defensive mode right now for defensive mode\nDiapers not preaching doom and gloom no he's just telling you be owned your guard you might want to look at it and say yeah you know he's right\nMaybe I should do something and all you have to do is call him at three three four\nTwo seven nine seven four three one you might not speak to him exactly at that moment who might have to call you back 'cause he might be in here doing this right right but\nHe will talk to you know sit down and talk with you and he will show you some some charts and some figures and talk about your situation that not your neighbors situation or Bob down the street but your situation\nAnd Tyler this whole thing to fit your financial needs but you won't find out all these things unless you call three three or four\nTo seven nine seven four three one call him to die\nAnd if you can't call did they call tomorrow call today it would be preferable to go ahead and get started quick as you can yeah just leaving you name any information on that in ...\nGood thing a day off anything don't cost anything but you know if you're a young young person and you're doing you four O. one K. and all this man keep doing it yeah because that's the thing for you but as you age\nAnd you've got you goody all ready you you're you're you've already got everything ready to to go ... and\nIt's it could it could just change your whole life if things go haywire so that's what I'm trying to say we utilize the stock market in different ways that are protecting you are\nAnd there's guarantees with these kind of programs to there in the insurance or a top world and that's another ... dimension of\nOf uh of of investing if you want to call it quantum economics or whatever you want to call it right there there's all kinds of approaches you know a\nLot of people say they got to go to church every every week to feel good and feel like they're going to heaven and some people say they don't need that but they they feel right there so\nIf you don't feel right with you're so right now about how things could go maybe you need a little bit of a counseling maybe you need a little talk people go to counsellors uh they're having trouble in their marriage and you know the counselor so having trouble in their life maybe you want to talk to someone about how\nTo steal used the stock market in ways that protects you from this potential great burst of a sort of lack that balloon going off in the Nineteen thirties Hynden verdict could occur\nBecause they've they've over or should I say extended the the envelope of this balloon right now to actually he could be\nFull of a flammable situation yeah\nAnd uh we don't really want to go down to the ground in flames when our retirement and her dreams were\nAre about to occur so if you're in that point in time maybe you need to get into a safe mode or look at getting into say voting still grow I'm not saying to not put your money where it doesn't grow um well I'm Talking about some good growth here but I'm Talking about being on a defensive mode\nIf you're getting is some age only 'cause a lot of times people just don't know ... and they don't get ready and they think somebody else is watching after him and maybe not\nAbled now given\nUndocumented\nJoining us now to line and he's with us again Brian camp Brian good to talk to what what is your opponent main by that\nOr else he wants them to vote in our elections to help her blue wave but when the ... or liberal or the right after that filed a lawsuit and Georgia that allow\nYou know people that are flag for potential uh non citizen issues to elections him and that is outrageous lower and we're going to put a red wall up around the state of Georgia so I noted is in a socialist behavior but my radical opponent\nOr she has received a lot of outside support ah which suck you can't blame her she didn't take anything she gets to try to make a difference in her campaign\nUh but the Democrats feel like is it if they can turn Georgia to fully a Philly blue then that will be a wall against Trump in twenty twenty what's the key to turning out voters and getting them to see the great danger\nOf a democratic takeover of Georgia\nWell I think they're waking up now is one of the things is concerned about is our base was as motivated Democrats or but with the cabin on the confirmation with states statements like these people are finally realizing the real Stacey Abrams you know when somebody is going to\nHaving fundraisers in San Francisco\nThirty days out from the ... you know doing fundraisers with Cory Booker made she should this crazy stateless about done documented books being part of the only way if she was with Elizabeth Warren of all the all boats and the state of Georgia campaign for governor\nPeople are realizing that that is not our values that is you know we're we're literally in a battle for the soul of our state for our future and it's not only about me and twenty a day and that's about our stake it's about our country\nAnd we're going to buy or I Will say that we saw a great turnout on our for our base yesterday and the first uh\nThe first uh ballots that were cast it early voting on the Kurds and all ... you know and they even with all of the road Georgia's don't agree with on citizens boating in our elections they don't agree with given free college tuition says it says I don't agree with the\nHope scholarships which is our educational scholarship to those that are here illegally and folks they stand up or it's a bad I mean we're literally as you said by the rest of the country sixty five percent of her money has come from out of state this election\nOnce again the Democrats are trying to play the\nEmotional manipulation game on this issue where the victims of illegal immigrant crime and the United states get almost no coverage in the mainstream media but the the tails and the woes of individuals who are making a long and dangerous track from Central America to our southern border\nAre their catalog and their chronicled like you know something out of a Charles curl a Sunday CBS Sunday Morning you know special\n[laughter] well and and ... that's why people are so frustrated NATO at our state but in our country they're ready for governor is going to put them first of the special interests to make a former\nDirector for ISIS or spent under the Obama administration called Stacey Abrams to get out of the race after this outlandish comment she made and you know over the weekend she was doing the Sunday talk shows up at the city or New York or wherever she was\nYou know I was down in southwest Georgia on Saturday back again this morning where we literally have are farmers at our family suffer from hurricane and [noise] you know that's what this race is about them about the Georgians versus about put our country first\nA head of those that are here illegally\nAnd no one has or sympathy for people and their their lights in their country but you\nKnow we have to protect our own we have to have secure borders we can I go to another country you can get free government here we cannot go to other countries and get free education I got three teenage daughter so you know it it's going to cost billions to do all these\nRadical things that Stacey Abrams wants to do and she's going to raise taxes on art work or just a four and people are tired of that they're waking up and they're turning out we're going to put a red ...\nBut we need conservatives across the country to join the bike like others or to help or you know drive the socialist radical liberal agenda go to jail for governor dot com and helpless if they can't or with their prayers and also their pocketbooks were in the ... on only about\n... about twenty twenty as oil\nYeah camp for governor dot com camp for governor dot com go to that website\nHelp out Brian because he has American first on the brain which is where what we needed to be we need the situation handled in a humane and smart way but ear your focus is to care for the people of Georgia people of of this country and we cannot be good to anyone\nIf we'd dilute what we have\nWith a porous border and absurd immigration loopholes that essentially results and catch and release which is what the president\nIs so frustrated about uh Brian I have to play for you something that Stacey Abrams is a beating on pretty hard which is the\nClaim of voter suppression despite the large voter registration record levels of voter registration in the state uh which of course can play both ways but ah we're going to a place and get your reaction let's listen\nHere fifty three thousand people that are being forced to go through unnecessary hurdles to prove their bona fide ease the second is that you have a hundred and fifty nine counties thousands of volunteering paid poll workers who are going to be asked to substantially verify that these IDs are sufficient\nAnd the challenges there is this this is a subjective standards it would be much easier if he actually did his job and process people in a proper fashion and we did not have the ... system\n[noise] uh your reaction to that uh the the law for asking matching from a licenses driver's licenses to voter rolls they claim that he was secretary of state are you\nThey used to vote in the state your response\nWell none of this ... law but I Am following state law that we have in Georgia for a verification process because we believe we should do not support this that we should clarify who individuals are before we registering to vote that's why we have a stick or\nA citizenship check this flight we have when you get your driver's license in our state ... this is a manufactured crisis they did the same thing before the two thousand fourteen reelection governor Nathan Deal\nThey did the same thing before the presidential election of Donald Trump and they're doing the same thing now we had record turnout of Donald Trump was elected in Georgia most votes ever cast in our state so I don't see how that voters suppression\nRight before this outrageous claims came with announced that we had or people on our voter rolls than ever before the state of Georgia\nBecause we have things like online voter registration that up push the general assembly and implemented is sick pay or ... years ago we have eight thousand more people on our roles now that we hit it had when I\nTook office she voted against online voter registration she does not support our common sense photo ID law she voted against our citizenship chit\nThe counties are the ones that are flagging these individuals' because the information from her local groups is not properly filled out on the form and by the way all these people have to do to be able to vote is the same thing that I Would or any other Georgia citizen that his own our roles they just have to go to their polling location\nShow their photo out the most likely their driver's license and they can vote so that is not\nA hurdle for people to do but they can't blame me on their own canvassers can't fill out proper pay or register someone wrote and if they use their own lines system they never had any of this problem\nTo start with so she's blaming me for a problem she created a and she's blaming me for following state law that's why I think Georgia voters are a lot smarter than she is on credit for\nThey're going to see the smoke screen is all they're doing this to drop their base out but it's working in reverse 'cause the Republican base that conservative base\nAnd hard work and Georgia's are going to reject the assault on November the ...\nAh well the the argument is that well if you have a letter missing in their name like Laura ... versus Laura Ingraham then ear your vote will be set aside is that accurate\nThat is not that is absolutely not accurate\nOkay so how is the matching take place like has anything to be a one of the substantial match or something to from the ... near license your driver's license to your the voter rolls yeah\nFirst first of all if it if he were to vote or just simply want to our own line system took their driver's license or their state issued ID card even if they did a driver's license all they have to do is put that information like it is only a\nFood it's good food\nAt New York theater\nNow it knew the express market with freshly

term elections and so there is this sense and you say it was hard liners as a sort of regular inter American politics now\nThat they feel like if we're more outrageous if we do something that is more offensive or controversial maybe that will create a rat in\nOr because he really is in touch with people on immigration right it's not a big issue I mean give me some facts before we get to our guests are the\nGallup poll the latest job big poll on the top issue for us voters was back in July\nTwenty two percent of Americans in July said immigration is the top problem for the United states is up from fourteen percent in June and has the highest percentage naming at issue in Gallup history\nAnd asking the most important or when they asked the most important problem question a ... again mentioned immigration as the nation's most important problem have averaged only five percent of ...\nOn generally a monthly basis immigration is the top issue in the United states slightly edging out the economy okay\nAnd goes on and on about this uh a Reuters poll found that Fifteen Percent of registered voters said said immigration is their biggest concern topping economic performance and health care immigration and the writers it's so was the top issue for voters in the election\nOf that number is higher of course among Republicans with twenty six percent of the ... voters citing immigration as their major concern just seven percent of Democrats said the same\nBut listen to this forty five percent of black voters in forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community\nNow why is that the CBS Hugo poll why is that because of course they live in the areas where immigration has a profound effect on the public schools the healthcare system\nOr in some cases crime a housing the list goes on and on\nThese are the facts Donald Trump is more in touch with the American people on immigration than pretty much any politician alive today he understands that\nJoining us now I'm delighted or he is with US Congressman Tom Garrett Republican\nFrom Virginia ... congressional district or he's going to give us a the latest because he sits on the all important House Homeland Security Committee as we see these caravans up and running again with the mass migration from Central America coming into this country because they know there'll be caught in alternately released\nCongress fan I can tell you my listeners are infuriated by this they want Congress to act they want these loopholes closed or can you tell us about what Congress could do in short order to prevent this nonsense off from continuing\nEvery time we passed laws and the ... bill or something massive funding stopgap measure we young the rug out from underneath the president who wants to keep his promises on securing the border your lead and bumper\nWhere the gentleman that I use the term loosely talked about hardliners on immigration is symptomatic of the fact that the left as co opted the lexicon changed\nThe meaning of words and I'd like for something to do explained to me when defending your national borders and sovereignty became a hard line stance because essentially what they've done is that if you don't want to open borders but near me\nAnd the American voting public needs to think hard enough to understand\nThe very ridiculous underlying assumptions that I Am all for a robust and help the legal\nImmigration system is I think you are but at what point did securing the border has become controversial and and and and why is that the Republicans cut the rug out from underneath the president as a relates to keep his promises on security our borders I Can't figure it out um and and that\nGoes wild and let me tell you about something that happened Congress and this was this is very concerning again to my listeners and viewers on Fox ah this was a earlier this year when we had\nThe opportunity terrain and these ever broadening asylum categories meaning domestic abuse and fear of gangs or what have been included in the credible fear\nA categories as as affecting social groups in a particular country so a bad effect\nOn certain social groups Jeff Sessions comes along as attorney general and says ... no no no no no a domestic domestic abuse and gang membership that's that's not part of what constitutes credible fear\nCongress sadly David Yoder\nA congressman from Kansas and a uh his dad\nBoth acted to remove that\nFrom the ongoing congressional action on that so that was gutted by Congress that's the kind of thing that is going to make it more difficult to hold the house of representatives Republicans it's it's insane that they took they they've decided to got what Jeff Sessions wanting to do there\nWhoa Kevin Yoder and Kansas has got himself in a tough fight and Republicans always think the moderator on the message that got him elected in the first place is some sort of magical formula for reelection\nI disagree dance with the one who rung you um and and so you you find yourself in a terrible catch twenty two nobody's list right that's a joke but I'm I'm a if we lose the house maybe we'll actually get up off our butts during the lame duck session and keep some of the promises we made three or two and a half three years ago\nWell I mean like the upside help the Republican white like Republicans\nWell I think again this is the most important issue for most Americans who are answering these polls immigration is either number one number two and these caravans come into the country if Republicans lose the house it'll get worse not going to get better it's going to get worse but\nWhen I said except maybe we'll get some some rich right you see is the leader McCarthy now talking about border security and I'm ... I'm Glad he is but I mean why now I fear that there is a political motivation what you're saying\nWell again I I'm not I'm not understanding really why Paul Ryan is still in as speaker of the house I think if you're going to retire or they think Paul Ryan is going to turn out the voters and and twenty Eighteen I mean God Bless all around I like um a lot but I was going to turn out to voters the guy who's flying all over the country right now Donald Trump\nAnger and Congress I'm telling you\nCongress is going to rue the day that that they didn't get the money for this law they did an appropriate it and they didn't change these stupid asylum laws that allow people to be gaming the system and then caught\nAnd ultimately released because we do not have the facilities to house them seven hundred thousand people in immigration backlog now ... court backlog claiming credible fear another client that's absurd\nWell a lot of prosecuting for the better part of a decade and domestic violence as a scourge on any nation but it's hard to prove domestically it's it's real hard to prove when the claim emanates real Salvador\nOh that is why they're saying we're\nHere alien abduction but that doesn't mean that but it's actually happening\nNow well again I think you and you seemed you understand this congressman Garrett but the American people are like we we\nGot cities with with the homeless a village is ten villages we got a veteran veterans on the street we have people who never were able to get back on their feet after the great recession or our opioid addicted we need help for those people we cannot we cannot be the saviors of the entire world we can do our best but\nAt some point ... we got to say you know we're here to focus on the American people and I hope that you take this message back to your colleagues in Congress because I'm telling you people are ... are are a light with ... with ... about the situation\nA congressman thank you so much for joining us would definitely do on TV than and we'll take a break a lot more to get too including an outspoken advocate uh against affirmative action don't go away\n\nO'Reilly here my new book and the killing

goal so here's a tip the best things you can do to help protect yourself around somewhere as to back up your computer often\n... scheme and in fact Harvard zone admissions data shows that\nA an internal to include that they were discriminated against Asian Americans and they bury the report that's on trial right now and one important point I Want to make your audience today is that\nHarvard receives billions in federal government money they're literally taking your heart or tax money and using it to discriminate against you\nWell I Am so they take all this money they have billions and an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student and still be a be you know swimming and money uh\nBut this would mean the federal government is subsidizing racism type of racism\nOr you know uh affirmative in a more but it's it's not just Harvard more than a hundred universities publicly endorsed racial discrimination in the Supreme Court's Fisher decision a you know\nAffirmative action is a nationwide system of government funded state sponsored racism [noise] um and it it has a huge impact on admissions\nSo what what do you um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision and the the the belief that diversity is the founding principal of America\nIs I mean I bet if you pull people in colleges and universities\nThe founding American principle it's of course America's founded on liberty not founded on diversity is founded on liberty but they they think that's sacrosanct the college has always\nList that as a compelling interest and there are a lot in their defense these lawsuits are that diversity should be a consideration I think the court has said it can be one consideration but it can't be the Supreme Court and the Michigan affirmative action case but it can't be the only consideration correct\nOr you're you're absolutely right but you know I kind of this is the point I Want to do this to the points I made when I spoke at the rally was I I had the opportunity to go to UCLA after I got into medical school and dropped out UC leads the school that doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions and\nI learned that it was possible to have a diverse class of African Americans Hispanics Asian Americans had whites without practicing racial discrimination is missions so I don't want anyone to believe that affirmative action is essential for a great\nQuality of education you can have a great education just let people in based on merit because there are smart people of all races religions colors and creates\nWell the uh the opposition um to your point of view would say that an ... year merely your your goals would merely penalize those who have been systematically subjected to racism so there's historical racism in the United states\nA vast we must give a leg up or special consideration to those who come from that class of Americans so that\nIt is fair then because historically they were subjected to this type of a systemic racism\nOr I Would argue in many ways it is the ultimate form of racism to assume that blacks and Hispanics\nNative Americans on my dad can't compete a based purely on racial grounds I think that all races can compete on a fair playing field and UCLA and UC Berkeley and\nUh the University of Michigan and other schools across this country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nYeah well this genie park who's Harvard Asian American alliance president was on MSNBC and made this point\nThe lawsuit is not about protecting Asian American by\nAn anti civil rights activists Manhattan well\nMy rights activists who was trying to bring down marrying someone writes protections in American society town and ultimately about his gall to bring down as a nation that is actually designed to increase fairness\nAngry ... increase there are the make education better for everyone which is good for Asian Americans as well uh your response to that\n[noise] ah affirmative action is racial discrimination against Asian Americans all of the statistical evidence shows that it is much harder to get into college in graduate school as an Asian American for every student who graduated from Harvard costs like her who is a harsh shoot at Harvard\nUh who was an Asian American there is an equally qualified Asian American student somewhere in America who got rejected because of the schools racially discriminatory affirmative action policies those vehicles spoke at the Asian American coalition\nFor educations Raleigh a just a couple of days ago so they're speaking for the few who got in ... there was a massive number who are victims of racial discrimination from schools like Harvard\nHow do you think this is going to turn out this court decision I mean you can never guess depends on the judge you get depends on a lot of different factors but how do you think this is going to come down\nUh it it it comes down to a ... it it comes down to ... for the first time in ...\nIn the Supreme Court ah we have a Justice Department who is on our side who sees this as racist on a a President Trump has been our greatest ally\nIn our fight to end racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites in the form of affirmative action uh so because we have this powerful la ... who is a champion for equal access to education for Asian Americans\nAnd white people uh I think that India and we may prevail or\nGoing to be that this is probably going to go on for some time on the federal district court level then no court of appeals and

he got a pretty big contract but in the ...\nStage by [noise]\nAnd so we're trying to hire anybody but we're not having a hard time finding good and reliable employees in the industry because it usually you need to hire\nAnd how can any gadgets hoping I can bring certainly the way that we can possibly find reliable and get people to be a part of this law candidate\nOr\nYou don't know any painters that are good and ... people we do know ... um that are good I mean people ... and that's the part that they hadn't been reliable\nYou don't know any painters that are good and reliable people well we do know that they have their own ... as well\nMhm so the only painters that you know that are good and reliable people already have their own businesses\n[noise] ... yeah okay [laughter] we're we're trying like we we play 'em that on the planet and like nobody's responding to it and so I just don't know where to look in order to get\nWell most of the time they would rely people run around with good reliable people\nYeah and most\nOf the time to fishes run around with due to says so usually when I'm looking for good reliable people I look around other good reliable people now I could be that you're looking at some of the other trades and you know when oil attrition that's a good person or a trim carpenter that's a good person and you start asking them who do they know that's a great\nPainter that you could bring on to the job\nA part of the problem is you're in a very very hot construction market in Denver and so every body's got work even do fusses\nYeah\nAnd your has your husband's he got more working hand on maintenance so that that you've got a bit of a labor shortage or when you've got a construction boom always in the city and that's what you're facing a little bit of but the way I have found like you know an example in our world it wouldn't be a painter but in our world it might be someone that's in technology\nSomeone that has a a great Rubio unreal developer as an example there's a shortage of technology and Web developer is out there right now\nIn most cities including Nashville in Nashville is actually a tech hub\nBut um you know there's a shortage so where do we find those well we you know we go on like you've done website you go on Craig's list but we get in technology groups and associations and but mainly\nGreat developers no other great developers great painter is the great painters or somebody is not a developer who has other influence in the end of the knowledge of the tech industry there's a great person will no somebody's great developer and send them our way and\nCourse you're going to pay them and pay them well\nI'm a but paying a duplex doesn't make them anything except the well paid ... so you you want to pay people well but you that that's not the part of the only part of the equation as you've already discovered so the only way I Know how to find them would be to find other people in other trades that are excellent and people in the\nPainting world that are excellent and try to move them onto your team once you get a couple of excellent people they will have a tendency to help you find the other excellent people uh sixty four percent of people to join our team last year were internal referrals someone already working here\nThat was a thoroughbred wanted new in thoroughbred that wouldn't want them to work here in another area\nNow we have the advantage of being a little bit larger and having a vast array of jobs not just a single job available but but that's how I've always done it I've I've found thoroughbreds Roma thoroughbreds and donkeys run with donkeys and so you know you just got to find\nI Do there is a steak dinner in it for you guys send you a good guy you send him a steak dinner you send them a nice scene ... him and his wife through scripts or something because it's worth it\nTo get somebody in there and you know being big good that way and I'll tell you I'm gonna send you a copy of a book that is one of my favorite hiring books that have written the last two years and it's from a friend pat Lynch you know and it's called the ideal team player\nAnd the ideal team player is three things hungry\nHumble and smart hungry humble and smart\nAnd that's what you're looking for in in a position in any organization and every trade and every organization has some people to qualify other high quality people every single one\nAnd if you can put them together in a trade that by and large is not that kind of people didn't even really a brand

eight to five five two to five or ... is with us in Wilmington, Delaware Hi Lucia how are you\nHi there thanks for taking my call sure what's up I'm I'm new at center and I ... and doing babies have to put my question actually about the four oh one K. profit sharing with my former employer\nI moved it over like you suggest and to roll over IRA and then I got a statement in the mail yesterday basically there was a other section where the fees or over three thousand dollars\nAnd by further looking into it their own forces for future fees and our for eight different signs [laughter] I'm kind of confused of every three thousand dollars\nOf my money how much money was in there it wasn't that much actually with only around Eighteen thousand dollars\nDon't I'm not aware of a mutual fund that has a forfeiture fee\n[noise] so I'm looking at um it's a ... with eight different fun names and then it says forfeiture earth and it hasn't been so negative and it adds up to almost thirty one hundred dollars that sucks yeah I thought I thought especially when it was only you know a small ... to begin with yeah really\nUm did you roll it was a smart Mr pro\nI rolled it over into ... previously um another IRA that I had already banned so you don't have an advisor I don't\nUm\nI Am sorry I Do not know the answer your question I've never run into the ... the only thing I can guess is is that you bought a ... that your company your former company the mutual funds are high seam mutual funds or some gun\nThat have got some kind of gotcha and they're obviously okay but I don't know what they are go ahead and get in touch with one of the more of us are pros and your area and just see if they will answer that question for you okay maybe they can tell you exactly what happened at least you'll have the mystery solved since Dave Ramsey too stupid to answer the question 'cause I just don't know the answer\nThe others don't does I'm Sorry I Wish her the ritual is one of those soon a Decatur, Alabama Hi Rachel how are you\nI'm great Dane how are you for taking my call sure what's up\n[noise] my employer is going through open enrollment all our our health insurance benefit and I'm ... I'm hoping that maybe you could kind of helped me job um they've introduced a new high deductible a\nProgram with an ages say which they will be contributing to and I'm trying to decide should I keep my traditional media clan or should I jump on board with this high deductible plans\nAnd how much is a premium on the ...\nThe premium all the eighty two per pay period they calculate to about\nTwenty one hundred a year and what about the other one the other one will be around thirty four hundred a year okay\nYeah and cry and how much is the doctor will only pay them on the PBS show it will be four hundred per individual or the PBS and for the high deductible Thirteen fifty per individual but there is a twenty seven hundred for the family you know\nAnd how uh how old are your kids [noise] ah my kids are ten and Thirteen are there any um ongoing illnesses ... ride prom\n[noise] alone all day all really honored adoptable [noise] how often do well I'll say like why am I right now we just hit that adopt a ball and one of our family members were about ... years as I said\nOkay so here's the thing you just compare your Thirteen hundred savings versus the ...\nWere fairly healthy we don't usually run through the ... so the hotter Dutch below a premium makes a lot of sense for us and that's how you look at it\n\nI get\nAsked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where\nYou are and your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice does include working husbands and wives as well stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace a stay at home parent\nResponsibilities I only recommend term life insurance since is the most affordable way to get the right amount of coverage and not break your budget go to ...\nAnd I I Would add to that ah the giving them the ties um was really cold I mean where when we started I\nUsed to routinely saying click while we're driving in church like boys what where give what we are tied into the church today you know we could do this or do that and I'm just slowly over time that's changed and I don't have this um you know deficit mentality anymore where in LA it's we've learned how to live\nHave joy within our means and once he hit that point it's um it just makes the road a lot easier to drive\nNow so you had a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar mortgage approximately when you started this and um it didn't seem real that would ever get paid off somewhere along the line you looked up and said\nAh this is going to work and it started like you were writing down he wants to the climbing up here you know what I'm Talking to the point you remember where\nThat was in the mortgage balance like when you got down to fifty or to go down to a hundred or when was that you went had gone we're really doing this\nI think it was last year I ... I went back to work for one year and it all of my income went towards the mortgage because it was about\nFifty fifty thousand laps and we just just piled on every month it was like he just kept accounting a down month by month we're going to make it and it was it was awful\nIt'd be you know even going back to work if you didn't already have those numbers calculated knew it was just for a

identity the UP as my grandmother and I'm I'm surprised actually that they went and picked her up but they did and uh\nYou know so because it is it is a federal law is a federal offense now to steal and identity and so\nUm she she's in trouble [noise] she's in real trouble but your sister ... could maybe accidentally activated all of this because she just had to do a police report to get the

you\nI'm doing good I just want to say God Bless a thank you for this\nThank you sir how can we help today\nHere so I have a quick question for you so um and I we we waited in a house or we saw the one I'm with the money we paid off a lot of our ... our our car I'm sure\nIs student loan debt mhm\nUm and so we ... we between my wife and I we oh about a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars in student loans [laughter] [laughter] um so we're just trying to figure out what we can do between the upgrade of the new house and the ah the student loans that we have left how will\nWe get paid off but we're just trying to just figure out how to do that [noise] uh\nSpend less than you make and put it on the student loan I mean what are you thinking about I don't understand\nWho basically we're just we're just trying to figure out like a bit there's three of them between us I'm a teacher [laughter] um I Know the built our loan forgiveness programs but I'm just trying to figure out\nA loan from his programs don't work there ten years long you don't want to be in debt ten years what's your household income\nSo take home between my wife and I we um we make to do show about fifty seven thousand a year\nOkay and uh how much is your house payment\n[noise] so we haven't got an offer so we just moved um so the house payment will be around sixteen hundred a month\nOkay you're right at a fourth us now by out All right and you have no other that except the student loans\nCorrect okay and so if you put twenty thousand dollars a year on these is going to take you five years so I think I think you've got to look at ways to increase your income\nOkay you've got a lot of student loans for two teachers where do we do where did you get your degree\nUm sociology classes I got my bachelor's was we we both work in a you know with an Arizona University\nWow you must have put everything on\n[noise]\nYeah you ... a smallish to largest the three loans pay minimum payments on the two big ones and attacked the smallest one with a vengeance that way you can see that trees all over from your shopping if you just chop a tree and it never falls over it's no fun\nYou know so you need to see you need to feel that reward of that little one going away when that little one goes away then you can attack the next one down but you got a five year plan unless you had some income to this\nFor thirty three and a and the only reason I'm considering it is because the the benefits are a lot better [laughter]\nUm they offer for one came one paid holidays more vacation um they also pay one hundred percent of my health insurance as well as your health insurance costs now\nI don't have any I Can't afford any mhm oh okay the company that I'm In company I'm with now it's it's like five hundred dollars a month or something just for me mhm over so\nIt was ... five hundred dollars a month or six thousand dollars a year you're talking about taking a pay cut of nine thousand dollars mhm you're going to trade six for non if you're doing it for health insurance the four oh one K. benefit is worth very little and the other benefits and you know more time off is not what you need you need more money\nThan any of the potential to grow with that\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nWell that can be looking at the next two years I can be looking at like maybe [noise] maybe another ten thousand a year back up to where you were\nUm yes plus the health insurance yeah yeah\nWell the the the benefits are worth a very very little in this equation um I Would not do it for the benefits okay I might do it if it's taking one step back and I get into a career I Love shark and takes six steps forward 'cause I Want\nKnow how old are you a twenty three so the question is when you're forty three Twenty years from today mhm does this take you where you want to go Twenty years from today if it's not telling you in that direction and then you're doing this for health insurance benefits and that's a dumb idea\nOkay [noise] um I mean maybe maybe not this job or in mind I don't I don't know exactly how are you not only that much about the company quite yet but it it does open the door for for the it's a big country and it could help transition\nMe into the career I Want to be what do you want to be it is I Want to be a master diesel tech\nOkay what do you do now I'm a welder okay and what do you need

your dog can get into a company that would put me through the school\nThere you go what's the other hand like you're talking about working mhm what's your the place you're talking about work and what

could've unfolded into actual movies additional scenes [noise]\nUh where uh someone could take a twilight zone episode and kinda unfolded into an actual movie you know like a planet of the apes\nYeah I I I agree with you on that and and to get to the first question you know the you know the escapist aspect that this while I thought I mean that I think that is part of all science fiction and fantasy of course is that that\nA scape his tone to it but you know it's funny that you you mentioned that because that is actually something that rod Serling uh often pointed to about ... gallery ah in the early seventies during the end of the Vietnam\nEra he felt that night gallery was giving people in the ... from the nightly news and seeing you know the stuff on you know step on the news about war and everything else that they go into the night gallery an escape\nThrough that so he never really said that about the twilight zone but I think the similar a point can be made about the twilight zone as well\nAnd it is surprising that that that someone hasn't taken you know a twilight zone episode and expanded it into a feature film all those there's been there have been plenty of films that are certainly twilight zone in ... you know influenced that could very well just as just as well be twelve of its own movies that aren't pulled the twilight zone\nWas it Jack London on one of the

listen I don't want to take the camera off of this guy I just want to keep filming\nThere any way we can make this into a two part episode he wanted to expand into an allergist because jak cotton was so good and rod said you know we just can't they don't have the budget we can't can't do more than half an hour but that's that's saying something when the director says most I'm just gonna let this

get a couple of heart attacks and he went in for a bypass procedure\nWhich was fairly you know cardiac bypass procedure which was and it was in ... new yeah time uh and you know it's interesting you know how new it was because if you read some of the news stories at the time about the surgery\nThey explain to you exactly what the surgery is you know they're going to take a vein of artery from this here and put it here it's like nowadays you wouldn't have to say I need a you know what a cardiac bypasses but that back then it was so new that that explains the surgery and\nHad the surgery and the doctors thought it was successful and um by the time they were selling 'em up he had another attack on the table and that was pretty much at\nSteve's with us first time caller in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Hi Steve\nHi towards a I got a little trivia but a ride a\nUh I live in central New York from\nSeventy two to Seventy five and I worked on a military base ... cynical army ... close okay and I would say a big a big arts and all that had nuclear weapons\nAre quite a few actually admitted depending on the news ah anyway rods home woods about two or three miles from that day\nAnd a a little town called ... up the road by Mao and a half or two miles with the little post office where are you ... where I used to have a ... book\nAnd that's where rod you could spend died when he he had a a swimming pool built on his property there a couple of miles away right next to the uh bay or ... that were in Knoxville\nAnd uh I used to talk to the um\n[noise] a puppet master sort of like a one room a purge of office\nAnd I said I I heard rod Serling with Iran during the day comes and once in a while and I always wish I had met and but I never did\nBut I I think that's where he eats the uh send it taped to Los Angeles who uh the uh contrived in periods a TV program and uh\nYou know he's very here you know as I say you lived right on Lake ... uh and and if the guy and that's not not far uh so yeah it could very well be and he was and he would dictate in Ithaca and some of the Senate tapes out to Los Angeles to be to be transcribed\nInteresting Steve what else you know about him what's that what else do you know about it and that's cool well\nUh when his career started to think a little bit uh he went back to that area and he taught at a I Believe it's Cornell University down there\nAnd uh he uh he buried not far from it so we're ... in a little cemetery called uh inter lake in Oregon the Laiki months but love that area in its wife or when they first got married they had their honeymoon there I'm On uh\nHer relatives parents probably\nOn their property and he bought it that way and they live there and they always went back there on a summer who you are right and relax and uh but a funny thing is you do a little radio a\nPromotion for uh people he knew an area like a tree or whatever might be ... or I mean which kinda cute ...\nJust to help him out of it well let's just to help him out\nYeah absolutely and I read ... already which really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it and the thing it sounds like he had a hard a goal\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for free for people or people at the college or or local businesses as he as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and and you know going through his\nCorrespondence they were showing kept everything he ever ever since he every letter he ever wrote he kept and that they still exist than you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally you know personal letters written signed and everything [noise] um he took that time to do that and\nIt was really amazing that that you can't really find somebody saying a bad word about Russia certainly do\nYou really can't Nick we're going to take a quick break them we're going to come back with final phone calls with you there special guests Nick ... book of course has called rod Serling is light board can imagine a shovel\nTo access the audio archives of coast to coast am log on to ... dot com [noise]\n\n\n\n\nCan you tell everybody he is on my\nHome and visors a total solution to any type of work you would ever want to do around your house\nAnd best of all it's completely free zone a hammock by their dot com or download free\n[noise]\n\nStand welcome back to coast to coast Nick ... with us Nick were the people get your book on rod Serling\nShould be available just about any wary of the books are sold as they say um you know to build one Amazon now Barnes and noble or they don't have it in the physical store will certainly be a blow to root for you or you can go directly to a university press of Mississippi website on the site but if you Google that I'm sure you'll uh you'll come up with that there is well\nTell us about the rod Serling memorials foundation\nI'd love to hear some of 'em a member of the board of directors of the foundation at the Binghamton New York based charity or that looks out for rod Serling so the legacy and and promotes his legacy a in Binghamton or as well as around the world really and working on\nYou know we've done a couple of are we called them Serling fast the last couple of years I'm wary of essentially had a rod Serling convention A People's common spoken and certainly in his daughter and Jodie Serling they've both been you know been there and you know spoke about their dad and\nAnd we've watched rare films and you know had Elvis cautions in radio perform scripts radio scripts performed I'm so we've had you know done a lot of a lot of things like that for the community\nAnd it's just about keeping rod in the public eye as much as possible and we're trying to at this point we're trying to really to get a statue built for them and bring him in his home town he loved his home town a and that should come to come across through several twilight zone episodes and so we're trying to get a statue vote for him they were trying to get a rod Serling museum in Binghamton\nSo these are all things that were that were working towards gosh I Would love to have had them on the show that costs a lot I Would love to spend five minutes with him I was five years old when he died so ... would have been something else what a great interview what about oh yeah oh yeah it was was\nTo the phones we go let's go to Linda ... in Medford, Oregon hello Lynda Barry\nMining make talking Tina and I'm going to\nKatie a that was the last one of my favorite episodes also the man and the radio or you're talking about me [laughter]\nNo man had found the ... found that radio in ... in the attic\nAnd down it played music and shows they'd only he could hear the plastics\nAnd author George I wanted to um I went to praise you for um how you thought up this show tonight I mean after after ... is a is a guest talking about haunted artifacts and they're they're tied in together so many twilight zone episode about ... not all\nAbsolutely I've gotta I've ... I've got to give credit to our executive producer Lisa lion and top Dan how's or our producers for putting that together\nYes and also Nick I Want to know um what was the first episode you saw\nPeople can tell you for certain what twilight zone episode was the first one is ... I cannot tell you for certain what the first one I have a so as I could probably narrow it to a couple um hitchhikers is one that I think was definitely one of the ... one of the first ones I ever saw [laughter] whatever\n... right\nYeah going my way and you can have chasing a you know chasing a driver not chasing up and it's just showing up on the road constantly are on the on a road trip um that's that's a creepy one a rod wrote that one and that was definitely one of the first ones but for whatever reason I cannot pinpoint it for sure if that's the first one I ever saw\nThe remember the plane that couldn't land and then we do you look down and you could see the brontosaurus the dinosaurs and it just it kept going back into time I guess\nYeah it's called the odyssey of flight thirty three and it's about a plane that breaks the breaks the sound barrier and somehow finds itself back in prehistoric times and ah you know A Rod's rounds brother Robert Robert certainly also a very successful writer actually wrote the the president's plane is missing which was a best seller at the time\nAnd was made into a TV movie um but he was an expert in aviation and he actually uh consult in rock consulted with him about that particular episode and other episodes they did it ever had anything to do with aviation he went to his brother offer advice on those so he actually got a technical consulting credit on on that particular episode\nNext up we go to Brad heard in the angels camp California Hi Brad Bird\nHey Nick was I'm I'm pretty sure that this was a rod sterling a tail it involved what they called it ... die that was in a capsule\nUm that started with a guy at a bar looking kind of this bonding or whatever and and uh\nProbably crying you know trying to give up drinking and somebody came up and gave him a ... said call this number\nAnd uh so he was curious he called it they said well come over to I think it was going to a place where they gave him this capsule and they said but the the one the one caviar is you cannot drink to get\nLung not drink like collies a message\nThat will um it will\nMake you very very uncomfortable and give you a really bad stomach reacts and and so ... was was a it was some little organism\nAnd it bad on alcohol [noise] it was dormant unless you drank alcohol in which case it would wake up then if it would just you know crave the alcohol and make you really really sick because they were growing\nThat's that sounds somewhat familiar it's it's definitely not a Serling I can tell you that's for sure but it does sound that that part about it created feeding on the alcohol and growing that does sound somewhat familiar to me but it's definitely not a Serling\nSounds they were so many classic shows though they all had these different messages remember the one where the camera took pictures of the future yeah and you name it as a race track board and you'll get the winning horse and all that\nYeah yeah most unusual camera was called an accent is one of the you know your previous caller was talking about a haunted artifacts I mean that camera was an artifact of flowers on you know they they have plenty of those the you know the telephone that the only ... when he was talking about that he talked to his grandmother on you know there's always those crops that are where the\nYou know where the Gulf and sort of you know so to speak of that particular episode\nMarion Rock Hill South Carolina have their\nTheir yard was always that way\n... says oh they're in the war that our our ... our one of my favorite story that you are just walk through that how 'bout that Ron serving as wrote those nasty or at\n[laughter] nah it's unfortunate that really was addicted he tried to quit several times he just he never never could quite do it\nAll that used to think either he really allows sick or that or ... they are very real wrote him a lot of them are just ... you\nKnow you're probably right way too much he would he'd come out on the set smoking wouldn't he\nOh sure sure it's hard to find a picture of rod Serling where he doesn't have a cigarette in his hand it's just there was it was it was attached to him it was it was constant\nIn those days it was the thing to do I remembered dean Martin lighting up on stage of Sammy Davis junior all those people would come out with cigarettes I mean it was it was the thing\nSure crazy let's go next to too many well in the San Antonio Texas I menu well I Do enjoy good morning good morning to you too thanks for calling us\nMay end up doing a great pleasure

together\nBut I didn't uh speaking of every time there's prosperity in the world somebody comes and tries to paint a devastating picture\nOr the United nations put out a story a little report the other day about fighting climate change now this is the biggest gimmick ever put on mankind\nOr this whole notion of climate change one of the stupidest most ridiculous stories as ever been portrayed in perpetrating\nWasn't that the league question that I'm Lesley Stahl was a button to ... I watch highlights what she talked about how chunks of of\nIce in what some was making ... who cannot take you into her side I'm just saying that's how she started the interview you know what's funny humanity finds itself\nYou know we were I worry point of history you managed a blink of history and we find ourselves on the district and then we find ourselves even within the blink of history just a blink of time of humanity were able to get you know a satellites and this guy and measure ice levels here and there\nThis is the best climate we could possibly imagine you know the greatest advancements ever made in humanity or times warmer than this the renaissance\nComing out of the middle ages end of the renaissance he was warmer than than it is now we seemed to survive we seem to get by in fact it is we invented things like hospitals and universities and and I mean people started traveling the world and and you know food food grew in abundance\nMore sunshine more heat more food more food I Am I myself am a fan of climate change I Want to see a warmer earth degree or to warmer I Would love to see that\nBecause humanity would advance by leaps and bounds over what we are now we're still struggling with a lot of stuff disease ... cancer I Would love to see those things solved and as the food crisis could so we're producing more food than we ever have\nViolence is dropping\nCoincidence as as temperatures go up you know what jak handle there saying right now is the hottest it's ever been on the earth in human history right oh gosh it's driving ... you know it's the hottest has been a hundred and fifty years on has been a two hundred years\nYou know what poverty worldwide is at an all time low poverty worldwide is it an all time low like like less\nThan nine percent of the globe right now is living in extreme forms of poverty there's never been heard of usually that number historically it's been over fifty percent of the world has been living in extreme poverty you don't want to leave he adds that sunshine\nHeat because then we have food and food equals not poverty food equals not poverty in global\nTemperatures if it's true that in the last two hundred years since the industrial era have never been as high well humanity has never been as successful\nEver so what what correlation do you draw I Want to see who managed to get even better I Want to see it even warmer ... if if that's\nTrue of twenty twenty Eighteen twenty seven teams the hottest year on record the previous how does your twenty sixteen the previous how's your twenty Fifteen good good because we're we're growing by leaps and bounds and our ability to\nFeed the planet the ability to put people to work\nHumanity has never been wealthier than it is today\nEver so why why why am I Believe climate change or global warming as they call it before it started cooling is a bad thing I think it's a great thing I Can't wait to get this climate up higher it seems to me the higher the climate goes the better off everybody\nIs\nSo high yelling well because the United nations came out with a plan to fight climate change here's what they here's here's their plan to fight climate it's all make Trump look bad the whole thing is the un says that twenty seven thousand dollars per ton of gasoline will need to be taxed\nIn order to offset climate change you know what that comes out to\nPer gallon you don't take a stab at what that is per Gallo was gas costumes to forty seven a gallon yesterday at Costco that's what I only sixty some well okay so if you get a Costco membership will be two forty seven\nUnited Nations says that in order to fly to fight climate change effectively they have to we need to put worldwide a two hundred and forty dollar per gallon tax on gasoline that's their answer\nRaised the price of gasoline by a factor of one hundred and that will fight climate change why so the humanity can go back to being poor and cold and starving to death\nI'm telling you you can't you cannot read it's like liberals will tell you we got to get guns under control too many guns on the street that guns are just everywhere you turn somebody's got a gun well you know what it was the murder rate was last year it was lower than any time since Nineteen\nGuns sounds like a safer place to live in my opinion the more guns we put on the street the fewer people get shot and killed\nThe more heat we had twenty Seventeen hottest year on record it was also the first year ever that the worldwide extreme poverty rate was under ten percent\n\nIt was also the first year ever since the previous year that we set records with bringing people into the global middle class which is not the middle class of the United states I understand that but that is a static measurement meaning do they have enough food to eat every day and do they have food for tomorrow also\nIt's never happened never happened that we've had this many people who have food security worldwide clean water\nAnd if global warming is so awful why is that measurement getting so much better annually I'll tell you why because crop yields go up\nBecause you can't grow crops in cold as we were just talking about tomatoes season ending you know why tomatoes these and then a gamble because it's gonna be cold outside and tomatoes don't grow in the forties if we can keep the temperature in Alabama in the eighties all year we'd have tomato sandwiches all year what might have\nAnd I want to go that extreme but a degree here to there\nMakes a big difference worldwide and I don't know why conservatives they're afraid to point out the facts about global warming it's good for humanity I've yet to seeing the single negative effect of global warming I've yet to see one all I've seen is prosperity and food grows that's it\nWhy have we can see that this argument to liberals who somehow bad because some pony headed ... poop tells us they're devastating consequences\nTo one tenth of one degree go off and you're going to be a terrible thing I was just going to be terrible\nEconomy awful or what are the ... the conveyor belt and the Atlantic ocean will stop you big dummy what it but it has and well the ice caps on Mount ... well they they haven't well\nUm I I don't mind it uh being shared out just briefly say that yesterday the day that my mother is going to be removed from life support and that's not why I'm calling uh fortunately I've been given a\nPrescription medication helped me get through this and I listen to your show actually as a form of comfort when I'm not a hospital and you know I have to disagree with\nYou [laughter] 'cause you're a big uh live [laughter]\nYou ... if you haven't noticed any negative effects from climate change ... let me run you through what okay so in Syria and around two thousand fix it was the beginning of an unprecedented drought\nAs a result of that trout you had tens of thousands of people moving into already overcrowded urban areas where they were not enough infrastructure in jobs report them\n... unemployment led to the upright them to the protests that led to the Syrian civil war the number one all the thousands of dead in Syria could be a way to to climate change and the resulting refugee crisis\nSo when you hear about Germans and sweet and Scandinavian women being assaulted and raped by migrants that too could be linked to climate change so there's not one bit of a strange don't you think\nYou know no not at all are absolutely no thinks that has nothing to do with climate change than it everything to do with the fact that that the United states in the global is in the corporate just wants to put a gas pipeline from the middle east from cutter annuity through Syria through turkey into the European Union because we\nCaused the drought somehow\n... there's a there's the drought is is a second is is something that has nothing to do with what's going on in Syria nothing to do whatsoever with it\nThat ... that Syrian crisis has everything to do with the fact that we needed to destabilize Syria in order to get rid of Assad the leader because Assad is is ... pro Russian Russia pays them money to not allow a gas pipeline to go through Syria\nAnd that money is not going I mean there's just not going to change they give them security that given I might give them all this other stuff in support and everything else in order to not have\nA pipeline running from the middle east because Russia right now and Gazprom has a monopoly a near monopoly on gas going into the European Union you don't believe me check out the former president of Germany\nNow working with that gas pipeline company out of Russia\nAnd they just signed a new twenty year deal with them they just on and that's one of your deal with them\nThat's all true but can be multifaceted I'm not saying that that all that isn't the case but the natural conditions that lead to the discontent ...\nThere's ... somewhere everywhere there was the dust bowl in the United states there was I mean there's always drought somewhere there's flooding and drabs his whether it's unpredictable it's crazy it's goes nuts but ... but but you would you agree with me right now humanity has never been more peaceful no one has it been more prosperous than it is today and twenty Eighteen correct\nI actually don't know the global step into the U.S is more tolerant of\nNon em on what what what major the twentieth century was one of the bloodiest nationals centuries of all time that the ... the the twenty first century is on no pays to do that in fact if you compare this century the last century World War one is wiping up with millions dead millions\nRight now what we were certainly so far more it's more people than laugh injury but you don't\nHe shouldn't and more money and the reason for that is because it's warmer outside it's a better place to live\nAnd I'm not even saying that there are no upsides to it I'm just saying that when you say there are no down to it and make it a little a little credibility on that particular issue ...\nWe were thinking about who they really ... the Allen entice recall and given Baron Hill [laughter] no downside it's all upset I Love him though when I was very I mean measure things saw here and let me say this on the upside down said\nIf you if you ever involved in a campaign they'll come a time when you got to make a decision on a particular threat or a particular\nTurn of phrase you want to use or a speech you want to give or something and it depends on how big or small the campaign is right um and someone will inevitably inside the campaign or even the candidate probably usually the candidate spouse say I don't know that's kind of turn people off that's going to turn off my cousin in law\nI my my great aunt Betty sue said that that she doesn't like that and and shouldn't we shouldn't do that everything is a calculated risk right and I I was at this conversation this morning with somebody when we're talking about\nCallers and listeners and people writing into the stations that I'm never going to listen again you know what I can have Jesus Christ on the air tomorrow I can say tomorrow we're going to Jesus Christ of the ... in some Muslim and in some you know a few of those ads ridiculous I'm never going to listen again if you're going to have the lord and savior on the air [laughter]\nYeah I mean it just reality everything's a calculated risk you're going to lose support no matter what you do\n\nBut the goal is to gain more than you lose and I think that's what's going on climate change our number two seven to nine to two adjacent\nCome on and doing I don't know how you doing Jason I'm doing good I I I Walk I Walk out to be back on al and but also challenged some of the stuff you've been paying wine climbing in like the daily temperature there not the same and I think people completely to temperature might be a part of the climate but it is more to it than that\nBut I think the main question is are we being responsible how reliving you\nAre a lot of interesting I don't want I don't want you to fire like do do liberals doing fine like seven points of ... and I just wanted to\nHave I said anything to conflate daily temperature and climate\nYou keep saying because it's warmer\nRight on it but what I'm saying is if it's warmer if the if the global temperatures warmer\nAnd and warmer global temperature has increased khat crop yields that's not conflate anything with daily that instead of thinking about daily temperature I'm saying if if the global temperature rises by one year I mean one degree then on average is one degree warmer right right okay\nThat's what I that's all on the go ahead\nBut but on top of that or to paint one has been responsible our living though we yes we are human that we're going to prioritize our own like this but\nWe're we're part of like there's more than just people on the planet though that they're going to hurt your one degree increase an average temperature negatively impact others being on the planet so they talk about Cory and other than the more\nYou know he would rather humanity suffers from the coral reefs flourish is is that loan understand\nThat's not what I was paying off point is that those things matter to a bright 'cause we're all like the coral reef or party but there's some that from which we get finished added oats and all those things but it's all tied together so they were saying I'm not saying go away fossil fuels are not paying any of that my point

want to be press secretary that need to quit their job and put in for the job as press secretary of what the governor and she'll pick up that's not their business to be revealing or personal\nMedical business is not their business to big revealing anything and you know as far as that goes you know this coming from Spencer Collier my God what a paragon of integrity and virtue right there uh you know\nHe was you know but at least confidant and then when things started didn't get it started going the way that they didn't like all of a sudden he's got a problem with ... uh ethical issues are in

have been arrested because with that have been you or maybe we would have been thrown over the under the jail\nWell I'll say this I did talk to I did talk to somebody about that and I sent a copy of

... governor\nThere's a time period in between where Spencer call your is not heavily and he's been fired but Bentley is still governor and then there's the time period we're cabbies governor were in the third time period now\nDuring the second time period there were some things that happened that if they ever became public there was some conversations in negotiations if those ever became public Spencer calling you would lose all credibility\nHe made me run up on ethics charges I'm not sure about that a but nobody would be using him as a source on a website for a story involving Kay Ivey\nAs

don't make themselves available and that so many more\nQuestion is a fair question did it appear that Geron was going to answer the question\nNo he seemed like he was stunned them wanting to get off the plane and even afterwards I kind of followed them out of the whole I thought maybe not a good idea to ... to pursue this but these questions but this there was an open invitation to speak with a church crush on a bunker Trump about it\nI'm ... I'm waiting for them to reach out\nYou know the the agency and there's a time and place was is it is exactly right and then he said well what is the time it by the time and Bush has for you to do to the press secretary it requires an interview with ... and if he does you yes you got it 'cause there's no you know\nSo what is what happens if they find out the clandestine operation\nSay ... or some other intelligence bureau Turkish intelligence\nAnd they kept pace with an together no I think what they do is they do it quietly behind the scenes and they try not to be posters are demanding which is the way you're supposed to do\nBond policy they want to do this like you need to get out and just ... from the house jobs and they say I think it's more to kind of give it some time with these guys try to work out their differences here so it was made you hear it here\nKnow the administration's approach continues to defer\nTo the Saudi timetable and the Saudis approach to its own efforts that fact finding instead of demanding the involvement of US investigators like the FBI or endorsing what the show gave family is called for an outside internationally supervised independent investigation\nThis approach leaves the unmistakable impression the White House is doing all it can to accommodate Saudi appeals four times and Saudi efforts to explain if they can what many fear is a high crime and a brazen human rights\nGrowing pressure on Capitol Hill even from some Republican allies\nTo denounce the Saudi actions or at least be more skeptical of Saudi explanations Lindsey Graham a longtime ally of the White House says that the crown prince is a toxic force who cannot be a legitimate world leader businesses are pulling back from the Saudis diplomatic tensions are rising\nAnd the administration feels very stressed about this ongoing situation\nAnd again that's the way to handle it is that you're not sitting there and this is so funny that the press one wants Trump to step out in front of the say where where did you do in your lead in the world kind of have their employees with this thing\nAnd you look at um the Saudi stock market you look at the Saudi um currency there there are certain really went into some problems here and that\nYou you can't fight off a dozen dogs that are kind of nipping at you if you have one that you can focus on that sort of and so I think Trump's doing the right thing here let's go to the phones to go to Jim Jim work on board today Marcia\nHey thanks for picking up how are you I'm good I'm great as a matter of fact I like great yeah\nWell let me ask you a stupid question there are no stupid questions well like this one don't they don't show up to the conclusion or is this guy in American citizen know well why do we even give a crap I Know it's humanitarian but that's in the United nations why is it all fall on Trump\nIs that no phone but I think his phone and a lot of different people I think that's what I think the media wants particularly the Washington Post wants Trump to do something and do something now [noise] I\nLike I said I think Trump is actually doing it the way he's and they're going to know well he's apologizing for no reason that it's just repeating what they said and if it turns out what they said it was wrong and I think he's going to let the course of action vote on it\nYeah yeah they just they just want to keep putting pressure on and that's all\nThat's exactly right that's exactly exactly why they want Trump to do their bidding for them and I think they were going to be other world leaders are going to step into this thing and kind of go you know it's interesting how they do it\nYeah [laughter] I could talk to you thanks\nChampionship is Tony Tony point one of whom dam or show on a Wednesday\nOr just kind of work for them by reading room that um they're having to harvest fest uh Saturday and Sunday down at um ... market and then let me tell you there's there's so much\nFun things that are going on they've got the hay rise they've got the new train they've got pumpkins to be curbed uh they've got all sorts of stuff and what you do should go in to the

decorate you can go purchase them bunkers\nThere your phone harbors but they're going to have music the whole nine yards so take advantage of this is a fun time it's gonna be every Saturday and Sunday beginning at ten o'clock\nFrom now until Halloween and the kids will love it it's a small price to pay to have a great time people will go down there and they stay all day and they just run the kids

care of so you guys gonna have a good time on Saturday or Sunday so take advantage of that [noise]\nLet's see here um we had a little let me do this in a hand June article\nAll right and this kind of goes with some polling data that I've seen and or the title of this op ed was is the blue wave collapsing that's coming up for midterms\nThe blue wave okay gloves and Fort reaches the shore here which is a short by Megan ... why why should the ocean\nOne can only assume that in the cabinet home there is a horseshoe over every door rabbits foot and every pocket and a lawn entirely planet with four

wave in the midterms in standing by Kavanaugh would all but concede not only the house but also possibly the Senate\nYet somehow he was confirmed and his party's luck is even more astonishing far from turning the blue wave in to an end to go to nominate the Kavanaugh fide seems of reduced day read undertow\nAs of this writing that back wash look strong enough to check democratic advances in the Senate and maybe even gain a couple of seats the Republicans are very lucky they might even retain control of the house\nThe GOP shouldn't be too surprised at such turns given its hard schooling and twenty sixteen about the limits of establishment expertise but Democrats have so far avoided taking similar lessons Hillary Hillary Clinton's defeat could be explained by historical accidents instead\nThe party settled on a comforting narrative\nRussian interference in the election and an untimely FBI announcement about Clinton's illegal email server and combined with the R K electoral college to hand Donald Trump a narrow win\nDespite his losing the popular vote bad luck of course but not much to learn to accept that sometimes life is unfair\nThe past few weeks can't be explained away so easily it's virtually certain that whoever leaked Christine Blasey Ford's allegations about Kavanaugh thought they were doing Democrats a good political turn\nAnd quote unquote structural unfairness of the political system can explain why voters told pollsters before the Kavanaugh process that they were leaning democratic now seem to have taken a right turn\nOf the blue wave collapses before it hits shore Democrats may need to ask whether hashtags me too and other forms of identity politics are really the wave of the Democratic future\nDemocrats have been waiting for that waved to crushed for a long time at least since the two thousand two publication of the emerging Democratic majority\nBy John Judas and raw a Texas area that was that\nInterested in him that books modest

salvation keeps failing to arrive we now have the most diverse electorate in American history\nIf the strong version of the E. D. M. thesis work correct not even gerrymandering voters oppression and ... timely FBI announcements would have hand that the Republicans enough power to tip the electoral college in their favor the prophecy fails\nAnd still a whole lot of folks seemed to be waiting for history to vindicate them\nOf a quote unquote right side were Democrats can dwell it doesn't mechanically hand out power to the morally superior or to the smartest or did those with the best manners elections or one by those rules symbol the biggest coalition of citizens to deliver votes where they're needed\nAfter twenty sixteen but especially after Kavanaugh Democrats should be asking whether an increasing focus on identity politics has actually enlarging their coalition\nThe more explicitly target specific identities the more likely you are to alienate the identities against which there implicitly frame\nAs Nick ... of the New York times wrote in twenty six team one way to think about Trump's victory was that the white working class people started voting like a minority group and were forty percent of the electorate\nAnd one way to think about the red undertow is that while women make up half the electorate ...\nAfter top of our break with ...\nAnd a three year\nOld kid on the old habits would follow me to get them\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center says is W.

Seavey something\nTo do to do it this way we are touched range in the house [noise] have a question comment\nBefore you know\nI Love to hear that [noise] cause\nUs to talk about their retirement system a little over two already saying what's the status of that but you mentioned in the show but I had several inquiries about right and you give him\nDown to um it's not going as rapidly as we would like and and and frankly anticipated I was chairman of the county commission you know five or six or seven and whenever it was that the county moved over and\nEasy we had a eight hundred employees are we only had one system so we were able to do it [noise] or as a well after we got to vote and that took us a while to to explain it to everybody and then take the boat I think it was like eighty to eighty three percent then we start the real work\nUm there are about\nDifferent systems retirements particularly in public safety that's where it really gets a little dicey\nAnd so um we've been laboring trying to get a where we could get it all mechanized we've found that a lot some of our files are are not mechanized or having to get those loaded in and just today as a matter of fact\nAh we ask the board to name a chairman of a work committee\nThat really would uh have a a purview over the the project a Scott Miller who's a member of that board or is now the chairman ... uh from our I'm I'm\nA tea or organization and Mac\nRepresenting the magma cloud representing the mayor's office are three person committee that's really going to be calling the shots as that and get it we would like to\nGet it done um sooner rather than later but it looks like it's going to be the June July timeframe and next year before we're ever of being a position to actually go there so it\nCould cause they really start by June July August and we would maintain we would be able to make the cut in June and if we're that we are the kind of over the cut over and if we're that far downstream\nWe probably will wait to October one because I'm a fiscal year how many employees would be affected by this um we got twenty five\nHundred because they don't care if you go through an X actually explain to twenty five hundred with all this means what what we've already done that okay and we've had a\nOf meetings because the employee every employ had to vote\nTo go now majority rules but we got eighty to eighty three percent so that was the first step and that's probably a five or six month process just understanding it working with the uh are saying and it seemed to be able to do that\nAnd then to hold meetings over thirty or forty five day period\nTo give as many people as possible the opportunity not once but twice to ask the questions because there are a few situations if you are working with us and you're in the retirement system already the state retirement system\nYou can't have to retirement so there are a few people that they've got to be special circumstances\nOur elected officials they can't go and so you got to work through those special circumstances and the fire department I think there's two different retirement system in a place as as a couple of retirement systems whether it's twenty five or where there's twenty\nOr so uh it's a herculean effort to do that but it's well worth the effort because if we don't do it in Twenty years we'd be at forty fifty percent of payroll transport our retirement\nDo you expect that this is going to have longevity within payday ah once we get there I think it will because what what we're seeing now and I think we're about over it because we just in the last a\nCouple of weeks if I'm convinced ourselves that it's going to be a while we always we all thought we could get there by January one uh and so those that were going to retire with their retirement I think you've already done there may be one or two others um so ... says yes I think it will help us\nI think it may even help us bring some people back\nUh because of they\nIt then you know issues that you that you have\nYeah I'm a strength is is still in that\nSub five hundred level I think the only ones or add thing is like forty seven\nOr we do have a class it is it up to forty yet last heard I was in the low thirties we're shooting or some time and I think it's mid November to have a class of forty so we'll have some folks are being early had to to be able to do that but if we get\nThirty five or or forty or even thirty or we do a really good job in the police academy\nOf hiring those that are not going to get washed out for it and we don't do this in the fire or we were like and maybe a forty or fifty percent and the far side of the equation but because of EMT or the ... the emergency medical part is the tough part with the fire a but owned the police side\nUh once you get through the academics or in the PTA I mean it's like easy sailing so\nIf we got this say make it easy if we got thirty we would anticipate getting twenty six twenty seven out of the\nCitizens in the pick my intuition does every ...\nThe basic cost yes interesting it could be an officer you gotta have EMT and Russian they're shown any trouble when it's been ... in the house and be right back\n[noise]\nIn Dannemora show\nNews talk ... three point one FM\n[noise]\n\nThe violent crime is down about five or six percent\nA homicide between last year this year I think we've had thirty I mean we had like forty four last year or so you would you know an average you have thirty five thirty six thirty seven so we're on that\nThat track I can also tell you that the the total crime is down about three percent some of the uh ups are in vehicular incidents like leaving your car unlocked and they've taken stuff from you are a break in state in the car things like that\nWhat we're beginning to see in the last few months is more juveniles involved in some of the crime\nAnd that's led us and repeat offenders and that's led us with the district attorney to do two things first of all we're all supportive of of him and his efforts owned the pardon and Paroles through the governor in the United states is absolutely I mean we we we see that\nTime and time again or and and some of the stuff you just got to shake his hand in the world that happened um and so that an issue we're absolutely supportive we hope the governor of can do something or other than or Seventy five day a moratorium there's got to be a lot more sensibility\nThey say it's not a bad day loading the population in the presence\nOf I'll just leave that to to what the facts are but the other thing that uh we we've got to do a better job of is holding parents accountable and so what we've done with the district attorney and his staff\nAnd I reached out to the presiding judge is Johnny I'm hard way is to meet with those judges and figure out a way to enjoy it and I'm not sure and joins the right legal word but joined joined the parents I Am told that\nIf a judge today a center says a juvenile and says to the parents and you need to ten parenting class there's no obligation there's no penalty if you do not\nDo that I've heard that from the administration added the juvenile they need to order those parents to attend and if they don't attend if they don't take care of the kids then they got to be in harm's way it's the parents we got the whole responsible\nAnd we had to buy them when we know that was coming down it was just absolutely incredible I should have joined\nWith him he didn't ask me to a district attorney has a\nPowerful person so a ... he can be totally successful and we joined him we support him in that effort as a he's supporting us and in figuring out ways to hold parents response as sort of ... and go to James James with both of them are so young when mare touched joined\nA mirror up pest control a bath\nAnd I go out on our way a lot of among all of that is rough road I've ever been on a mile up\nYou know we hear that a lot and and we've actually looked at that and put that in the context of of relativity I guess would be the right way to saying because we now have a pilot program where not the naked eye not the human eye\nBut that machine that's what's he saying to me uh okay uh\n... they're saying hunter estimates about foreign at that\nThat in the scheme of all of the others it doesn't rank at the highest level to get it because we're going to ban something in the three to four maybe as high as five million dollars in a paving program half of which are going to be in the neighborhoods and half of what you're going to be in these connector but I\nJust as as late as three months ago we looked at that hunger loop road scenario and did not deem that\nTo be at the top of the food chain or own a a a own needing needing pay now needing pavement and getting it done today so the best I can tell you is it's on the radar screen we know what the estimate is\nAnd at some point in time it will be put into the program but it's not in this year program\nJust drop them over there while ago and I'm at four or five of the um and they're ... it all\nYup why we need to charge him due to use that kind of out the other ... you got is a down all lessons said either\nGames if we knew him that I ... I tell you it's on the radar screen we do know about it we do know the cost it probably um\nAnd you're not down on a lot of several you must cue the people in hunter hunt on the road to call\nThe others have called on uh on on that bike path to where we are worse ferry Rosen yeah welcome Winfrey road should be finished uh we just signed a letter or this week maybe yeah yesterday or to start the process own from the bypass out to this the the county limits as soon as those\nAre going to where it's worth it wasn't James where's ...\nThank you for taking my call it my here I I Want to first of all echo a with another caller saying the I'm sure going to a big concern when you leave it was ... I Hope it's not going to be like one of the military left Iraq\n[laughter] would go ahead rich\nOh okay well maybe they're not come out\nA way that might try to cut you off but I think\nOh okay well um\nOne thing that I wanted to bring up in and it's kind of been a one elephant in the in the room and nobody wants to discuss it in the recent want to bring it up on the show was because he has strong feelings about it\nA lot of our businesses are sticks and bricks businesses that we depend on for taxes locally are in the life blood or a municipality as far as providing services\nA lot of these are going under because they can't compete with online businesses they do not have to pay taxes what are your feelings about the mayor and what do you think should be done\nYou're speaking to the crowd we are the big city mayors along with the league of ... is really been fighting this\nOr when this whole issue came up a five or six years ago the state legislature in their wisdom decided that they were going to make a volunteer program with these Internet sales and offered them an incentive the incentive was that rather than paying the ten percent\nThat is is if if if if you didn't have the next as we got a nexus you gotta pay the full freight but if if you didn't have a nexus\nOr they they cut it\nFrom ten percent to eight percent well in the ten percent that we have here for goes to the state three and a half goes to the city and two and a half goes to the candy wonder which goes to education and so what they did was instead of cutting from ten to eight in have every one of us take a little hair cut\nThey gave the whole have got to the city and the county they kept their for [noise]\nWell there's no one you know ... and you know you know when I asked the question to the leadership you know what the answer was we did it because we could now that's not an ally and as soon as they were alive so let me just say this there's no candy\nOr let me say very few if any counties that have attempt to ... percent sales tax most of them and the one one and a half [noise]\nThe the city's own average you're going to be in the three and a half to four but we'll sit five ... four and a half so they are getting a huge hair cut so what we've been doing is we've been trying to work through\nGetting some parity because the brick and mortar ... are getting hurt as well as the cities and the can is to get hurt so we tried for the last two years to get some legislation\nThat would get more and parity what we were able to do is to get the county to lessen the resident a fifty fifty it's a sixty forty six to say these forty to the candidate 'cause that's where all the activity goes and now because of the ... the ruling by the Supreme Court\nMore people are going to be involved in paying\nEven the eight percent now we would love and the legal ...\nInternet sales ought to be ten percent and we shared just like we do that\nProtects us and it protects the the brick and mortar people I don't think that's going to happen maybe nine but it's probably gonna continue to be eight\nAnd what we were trying to do then is to make sure the city's a do not get disenfranchised but I got an also tell you the county has got a very strong a lobby so I I agree with you a hundred percent here's the here's the thing that that frustrates me you go to the retail association\nThe retail associations and asked them what their position is\nWell some of these Internet sellers\nAre members of associations they're paying big bucks and so they're not all in on the eight versus ten at the end of the day it should be ten percent on the Internet sale but I ...

numbers but\nYou're going to cruise doing well and Texas you've got a I've been in Texas is about Eighteen points and I think he was a teen boys will go down to cruise or I watched part of the crews are wrong a debate last night\nAnd you could tell what was going to be learned that he's behind so we're just trying to do some game changer that was their last debate and I don't think he pulled it up to cruises was pretty good it is a good one a way to that's where the president go to ... um\nThat is a former ah ha China secretary a that's a Democrat said by the way that doesn't mean a led by a Republicans ... moved up from a plus too to a plus for now make Sally in Arizona's moved up um a plus six to eight\nThat's that's a very very good sign 'em\nAnd then one of the things is really helping out and I'm\nFor it to show the Scott influence on shelves lose our is a is when they happen out she's a Hispanic and um\nI was watching part of a sky to vent including his talking to people about what was going on with Michael ... he just half of it it does it in English and then he does it in full Spanish ... really good at that that that was impressive\nWherever special just coming out in a jungle primary going on in Mississippi that I think the Republicans who do fine and those are Democrats who kinda licking their chops and that one um and camp in um Georgia is slightly moving up where he was opposed to now is a plus three\nAnd I think he's going to pull down one out as to where it's going to be a much bigger number\nWell and with the news today that seems a lower will only drop something till after the terms that might have put people at ease there won't be any October late October surprise early early November surprise from the Mueller team they are going to wait after\nThey uh how do you read the are doing it after the church that does it say ... code to me is that it would have affected the ... the question is what effect it negatively or positively\nRight it could go either way it's kind of hard to judge it because it either side is going to view the one man's word is another man's law so\nWell there's nothing there and there's no collusion right and that's what he kind of comes up with and said it but we do clean up some bad things are there\nThen that will be a major victory for the price of major victory and then the dams will go into this kind

air gun to take a deep breath politics is a lot of fun anyway you look at it\nWell I think the Democrats will learn that unless they're actually explicitly laying out a vision for the future that's do big broad policies dealing with the big structural issues the country faces order foreign policy or the fiscal house getting our fiscal house in order\nWith ... and it made me really happy to see President Trump's cabinet meeting say to each of the cabinet secretaries come back with a plan to go five percent from your budgets\nI'd love that absolutely love that medicine is so fast for you though he did say we can eat sections if you give me a good reason for an exception or maybe you can cut more than five\nYeah the bottom is out of all those people in the room if you type mad at us out and then you take the Social Security Medicaid Medicare component out of it right there's not five five percent it's easy for them to others who got but it doesn't affect a big chunk of the budget\nRight and ... is Seventy percent it's interesting though if you did zero baseline budget and where you're not getting any of these are the this is the amount of money we want next year projecting more money\nWill tell you the ... the guy who is yelling at the uh the guy in the ... car and Conan Whitey and he was white right they they just put it in the loop and keep playing in

know I don't know if you keep up on Puerto you know I have a ... and that's not I have a brother up in that area and stuff in British Columbia and let me tell you a Portland is insane uh and that's and that's probably why um Washington state might end up\nAh Oregon light ended up having a Republican governor mhm you know are right now they've got over it aren't they the one that lost the governor who got investigated and then he resigned and then let's say the governor woman I'm a\nNational asset\nLesbian woman is the she's the governor now right and and she's been a disaster and now she's actually in danger of losing that they give you a bad now than he is going to field they if they end up getting a Republican governor elect isn't in Oregon\nNew uh but uh the only thing I'm concerned about is we're not covering the health care issue very well Republicans are not in every ... every one look at when it when it is a sequence of what's the number one two three four um issue\nMedicine and medical is at the top of everybody's list\nWell one thing I I definitely they push back on it this false narrative the Democrats are trying to put out there that you know that the Trump Administration is going to get rid of the uh\nUh the pre existing conditions exemption you know I'm ... although I personally think or if you make a insurance company to have a pre existing conditions that's no longer insurance you know regardless of that\nIn letting the Democrats lie about it they were going to remove that you know we're going to make everybody have to pay for their uh you know the higher I think we need to push back on that for sure\nWell one thing to do on the ...\nYou're healthy and you you you know you ... you can pass certain tests and blue moon assuming you insurance it this way\nWhen you look and you don't have anything but you're not necessarily that healthy winter so insurance can you describe it if you do have a pre existing condition they're going to sell your insurance it this way and the government is going to have to subsidize part of that because other than that it's just going to blow up on people\nYeah well even Obama did that I mean what when Obamacare could they they they didn't make all these companies cover the conditions what they do is they put them in a pool that was thought that I you know um let me ask one last night he got ...\n... what do you think about the uh Florida a governor and Senate race or are we just the I mean hey I saw you know even though they didn't even poll the panhandle and they still had a melt in and they had a uh what's his name a report that they had a Scott and now the governor then they got to go the other guys represent\nHow you doing human um was kind of knows who are in prison\nRight right maybe it is the governor's race to\nDo and you know giving them a dissent is\nThe fact that they they any in any of it they had both Republicans still buy like a couple of points and they weren't even able to poll the panhandle because you know the problems going on there\nDo you think that race is close to that they're trying to say it is I'm looking at the early vote early a ballot Catholic and the Republicans are just taking it away you know even though I don't really rely on that too much but typically Republicans do\nWell assume you're talking about St Petersburg propose I just came out as kind of about two million I'm only about one yeah yeah the difficulties that they have with that is the way they wait for the ... they over weighted as a Democrat to Republican and they underway to independence\nOkay I guess okay well I always I didn't get to look a mix on it so but in any event I you know 'cause they're all use the er there's always real close and actually dealing arms off and on like no way is Florida gonna ... gonna like you know way back and see\nThe you know the Nelson right you know go on the other way but I I don't see you only have one and becoming the governor of Florida may I just I just don't or in the George or race or the crazy wacko left this woman that's running against ah the the the the white bred conservative yeah well what kind of what kind of numbers do you see in that race\nFor a campus is ahead of that I have a lot of people that I've talked to in a in Georgia and um they they are excited about voting for him this lady wants to basically take away the motion picture industry out of Georgia which is a big big shoes you know and um\nI have a friend of mine that has a stake in this kind of production place that they do ah he he's a ... a share is a is a ... tennis ownership and he said that place would be worth losing that if they should get rid of that\nWell she she's she is they left us wacko I mean it's like I'm going to we're
