looking at different books in the Bible that they were they were taken out\nOf the ... the ... tax which are left out of the ... sanctioned versions are what they call ... versions of the Bible determines things hidden away which implies secret her esoteric literature however none of these tax wherever considered secret up until now\nOr our ah our\nI guess the last generation I guess people are this country in the last thousand years and some promise to bubbles their place between the new and Old Testament and the Roman Catholic Bob all the books are interspersed with the rest of the texts in this case there are also called due to run a can of coal which means secondary cannon\nDrone rejected these books when he was translating the Bible in Latin\nBecause no Hebrew version of these techniques could be found even though they were present in the Greek Old Testament ... however they eventually were accepted by the church and most of them remained part of the Bible Protestants rejected these books during the reformation is lacking divine authority\nThat scares me that man took it upon themselves to do this that that really scares me\nThey either access them completely replace them and the third section at the bottom of\nThe Roman Catholic council of Trent on the other hand declared in Fifteen forty six\nThat the dude are due to run a chemical books were indeed divine of these books Toby is Judith the wisdom of Solomon ... and maccabees remain in the Catholic Bible first estrus second estrus a pistol Jeremiah Susanna bail and the dragon\nPrayer of ... of a zero and the lay lay a dose humans are not considered part of the Catholic ... ...\nWith one exception all these books are considered Old Testament they apocryphal New Testament letter Apollo to the lady oceans was once incorporated in many versions however it is now considered just another part of the pistols in is emitted from contemporary bibles\nUm what's interesting is bailing the dragon listen to this chapter one\nAnd then that same place there was a great dragon which they of Babylon worshipped and the king set into Daniel will they'll also say that this is a brass\nJust talking about I guess Daniel saying that it's an idle in the king's thinking you're you're talking material idle and the king says low he live at the eat and drink is that cancer not cannot say that he has no living God therefore Daniel worship him\nThen said Daniel into the king of a warship the lord my godfather he is the living God but give me leave all king an actual slave this dragging without sort or staff\nAnd the king said I'd give the leaf\nThan Daniel to pitch fat and hair and did saved them together and they lumps there of this he put it in the dragons mouth and sell the dragon burst in ... and Daniel said lo these are the gods ...\nOkay when they call it a transit when a planet crosses in front of one of these points of light it causes a slight dip in that amount of light this received by the astronomers\nNow NASA has developed a system of berry special Creigh supercomputers that were designed to do nothing but search for these little ... says in light that's how they found the transit planets right\nNow they did this in a small little bit of light like I said but the Kepler Mission\nAnd an astronomer Yale well made back up a little bit they had the ... the program the computer to look for this they didn't find any variants but some astronomers university wondered what if the computers miss something\nSo amateur astronomers were called upon to sift through all the data and look for the tell tale variances in light this project was called planet hunters hunters so the human beings were called upon to go by hand these supercomputers\nAnd trust me NASA's not working with six hundred dollar laptop from Wal Mart\nWe're talking Christ supercomputers that cost millions and millions of dollars but as you and I should know by now the human brain has an amazing ability to recognize patterns so with the aid of three hundred thousand amateur astronomers they found dozens of trends that objects in that one small spot in space\nThem are going through the data they found the strength signal from a store called chaos see eight forty six twenty eight fifty to\nWell let me explain how the computer represents the emissions in the blocking of the starlight\nIt is plotted but the horizontal plain representing the light is strings from the target area of space from left to right is that they went on a flight on the screen of black\nAny interruption of light is reflected no pun intended and simply a small block of the white lion missing now the largest planet we have here Jupiter would represent a quarter inch of missing section of this line\nOur own earth you could barely even see it that's how small are this\nThis representation representation of Tom follows the line from left to right a normal interruptions and the light caused by transiting stars that last an hour or more you'll get a small little chunk missing but whatever this thing was this dark KFC eight forty six twenty eight fifty to\nA huge several inch long chunk missing it lasted a week transiting in front of this light\nNow in graft out on the screen like a frequency would be on them to sell the scope the deal was asymmetrical not uniform meaning that this thing was not perfectly round like a planet should be\nSo when the planet hunters or solve this they contacted the astronomers and the physicist at NASA who went through the data over and over suspecting maybe something wasn't right the data supply from the satellite maybe it had an error in it there was no air\nSo then they began to her ... several theories we're examining among them the notion that the stark chaos eight forty six twenty eight fifty two was simply young and what was interrupting a slight where the massive clouds of material that the star was born out of however this was dismissed as all the other signs of recently birth star were apps and\nThen someone suggested maybe it was to breed from a collision of a couple of planets in front of that star will this too was rejected as there was no glue as you would expect from such an impact because they eat\nYet again another astronomer upon that may be massive\nAnd they at that precise time and place and they blocked the light well that was kind of consistent with what they were seeing but you'd have to be talking about tens of thousands of comments would have to come by the same time which is a statistical impossibility\nNow despite knowing that this was an impossibility they had to explain it somehow so he went ahead with the whole bunches of comments idea and published it in a paper now what's interesting they entitled the paper where's the flux the acronym WTO else standing for you know you know what the\nCause they knew it was BS but they had to publish something and that's what the late ... stronger tells us\nMeanwhile as the we don't really believe this explains why the issue but we publish it into a group within NASA decides to contact city the search for extraterrestrial intelligence who decided to point the world's largest radio telescope at the green bank observatory to this KFC star\nWhat they found is mind blowing they found a giant dice since the year it's not a planet which is why didn't show up is perfectly round it's a giant Dyson spear\nPostman been talking about these these are artificial planets\nNow it's described as one hundred times greater in size than the distance between the earth in them and that's a quarter of a million miles that's how far does to the moon so hundred times you're talking twenty five million miles in diameter\nThat's from here to Venus that's huge yes it is\nAnd this is a Dyson sphere in other words this is an artificial planted in other words a group of extraterrestrials constructed this thing instead of a planet\nSo ... and here's the interest what I found most interesting out of everything I read how did the computer's missed the flight interruptions that the humans didn't miss it makes you wonder where the ... with a computer program to miss this\nMay register the computer my thought it was a star\n[noise] you know but uh but with the with the interaction of the uh\nCan't the like I didn't know I have to buy something massive they had a computer missed that\nI don't know I mean it it it it shouldn't have and put it that way\nYeah it shouldn't have and my question is is this technology looking out for technology say\nI Know that sounds crazy but hey it's crazy we're we're living in right now I don't know but it's I find it very interesting um to say the least because you've been talking about Dyson spheres planet X. and all this other stuff and it it really makes you wonder\nWell I mean I've said it before said several times on the show that are that are that ... are mirror or is the original ... yeah it is it is in that store is Dyson sphere right uh-huh for example that don't know that's what a Dyson spheres\nAs a weapon it's all it is and um and that was the same weapon that destroyed that this brought to your mind it's a\nCelestial weapons platform right there's a planet there's a plan on the inside of it and and again I mean I get into the whole the whole story of it or what what happened in the beginning and and it's and it's ironic you mentioned that you know because you're going to tell me it's in the video to\nUh know for sure but in the\nIn the original and the original law up upon ex story of the ... a great born heaven and it was in a um it happened in a in a ... older sister a solar system that three stars in it\nAnd um and there was a great war and the uh the whole solar system was uh was was was disconnected or disjointed from uh from\nAnd and the Hebrew Hebrew accomplished I'm a bay it mimics the tree of life or this this system came from from a from the southern reasons the southern region of our uh\nI'm a galaxy in other words and um [noise]\nAnd it's toward toward the constellation sickness which ah which which is representation of the swan and and in some in some pictorial references it as a as a vulture and they say it is a originally as a bunker none of us won't\nBut I'm the area to area I'm Talking about is are on the on on on the ... a so called tree of life\nAs a section that's in the southern hemisphere they call it a coup and if you don't believe me I look at a\nMile a coup and I'm In that system that system was kicked out because of the great war and uh\nThe star along with the planet that uh that they that they covered license fear\nThey actually built a covering on the planet you know because there were so far away and and the actual war or the explosion blew it lowered far enough away that it it it became transient and it and they came close to ah\nTo to our star and they got caught in common in Salt lake or our son's wake and um that makes sense and that's how I get pulled gets pulled in every year or not ... I'm Sorry every thirty six hundred years yeah if you see somebody that's right orbit\nBut that ah to to be specific about the er about life in fear to terrorists talking about that that that's fair came out of the same same system came out of sickness constellation sickness\n[noise] you know and I'm going to go back and say this again and I think it's nice to be reiterated over and over and over and over how arrogant it as it is it for us humans to think that once God made us play he hit the jets that he couldn't do any better no point him to create any other species I mean we're yet but the catch me out as far as God gives Clinton he's gonna retire now\nHe's just going to sit back take it easy and just watch us as we go about destroying everything he told us to do and not doing what he told us to do and doing what he told us not to date that's just what we are hell arrogant is that for us to assume that about him\n... and folks well where were the first one that looked like him for that one yeah I ... with us 'cause I tell you he's got to be sorely disappointed in his creation\nAnd you know I've um I found you know just by just by examining all the different species of a I'm a I've read about and I've been told about\nThat every one of his PCs out I was told about that was that was real\n... this this can't happen and I don't think we are yeah Los\nYeah because uh if you're looking at a biblical law professor ... ... to be the enemy gets it\nYes New York ... and one day\nYes they are very very negative control the whole scenario and the and that's when they come and start yes and um you know at some point in time you know we we people don't believe this but we we get invaded\nThat's going to happen it's going to happen for agree they're coming [noise] I don't win but they're coming yes so be prepared I agree\nYou know I sat down [noise] last night intent on prison Internet on my AOL platform the one that I've been using since Nineteen Ninety three and I have to tell you it's horrible now simply reading the comments of all the sock puppets on any and all of the stories anything having to do with politics for Donald Trump\nIt's enough to view or excuse me enough to them your view of a prosperous future for this country\nAnd boggles my mind how we could ever trust much less for allowing the justice system that's been shown been proven to be corrupt\nIt would seem that all the various systems installed by our founding fathers had been infiltrated are now under control of the enemy as a matter of fact\nThe uh who circus revolving around Trump's Supreme Court nominees shows me that they have completed their infiltration of the lesser avenues of so called justice and our network into control the higher points to the Supreme Court of this nation and folks this has to be stopped\nNow the ... circuit says completed is limited ruin in this country and as well past time for this to stop\nAnd if a or we could come to this rather obvious conclusion don't you think that the feds have to fly in the not arrested this man why is he not been stopped\nWire the cops being ordered from Omaha no less to stand down when they call them attack innocent unarmed people or burn up buildings loop stores sit sit everything on fire why the costs been told to stand down\nIs it going to take a citizen militia to protect the people it sure seems to be headed that way and I hate to say civil war but something's going to have to give here uh 'cause this isn't going to work the way it's going to stop going to work\nYou know the people that we look for for protection or not protecting us as a matter of fact it's kind of the other way around it's like they're the ones behind the ones who are attacking has\nThis has got to stop we we can't we can't keep doing this\nUm it's unreal and the police just stand down they don't do their jobs\nIt none of it makes sense to me I don't get it\nWe're talking about biblical prophecy and to me the Bible is the book of truth I'm\nAccording to the Bible when the in time when it gets ready to go well it talks about mental like we said earlier mental ... death not find it a mental work all day for enough money to buy food for that one day\nI see that coming I see the insects are being infested with a nano\nAs I've told you own a another show in Germany eighty seven percent of the insects have disappeared that's happening here to every insect that I look at it under the microscope has nano a has quantum dots ... things has fibers growing out of its eyes\nUm the stuff that's falling from the came from the camp trails the aerosols is destroying the population of the insects so I Know you're thinking look good will have less mosquitoes to fool with\nHere's what you gotta look at\nLook at the way everything is laid out what each the insects the birds and other being's okay there the next fall once the insects are gone or fully infiltrated the birds are going to be fully infiltrated they're going to die what each the birds you work your way up the food chain and\nGuess who's at the top you and me we're at the top it's come and folks I can see where there's a point\nIn the not that distant future where food is going to be super expensive food that does that in fact you I'm ... I should say it's going to be super expensive that's what the Bible is talking about I Believe\nAnd I tell you something else and people to bargain with me about this\nThe abomination that causes desolation\nWhen Jesus told the fair sees tear this temple down rebuild it three days they thought he was talking about physical temple they said there's no way it took this ever how long to build it he was talking about his body because our bodies are the temple of God\nI Believe the abomination that causes desolation the same thing they're not talking about something that's infecting the physical temple they're talking about something that's in fasting the human body\nThey're talking about more gallons they're talking about the stuff that's coming out of these aerosols\nThat's exactly what they're talking about\nMy life on it as a matter of fact I have been alive on short three minute break we'll be back this is clear in the military and suppose in the studio we'll take your calls when we get the top the our CEO please hold on\nWhat's your biggest investment more than likely pitcher\nTreat it that way when you hire a fainting contract\nThis is your son from the good some gr how to sell your home and this market or market has changed in two thousand Eighteen from a buyer's market to a seller's market\nForty five percent of the listings and the river region have sold in sixty days or less I recently had to ... seven days or less\nIn today's market you must price you're home properly for the current market have the home and show room condition at all times budget and your price to pay for a portion of closing cost be able to show your home with just a few hours notice make sure any repairs you have put off get them fixed now\nPainting landscaping repairing any rotten wood will pay dividends and a better price and a quicker sale here at the good singer wherever ten point plan of action to get your home so we're more information call your real estate sores the good some group five five one zero two to five or email me ... charter dot net\nEverybody rich Thomas for metro fitness now why should you choose metro fitness for your health club retrofit this has over sixty group exercise classes available at no extra cost including yoga spinning dads boxing stable functional training area where you can do TR X. box jumps out a lot more off or no\nAnd Peter I strength system and it's a place where everybody knows your name you get all this for one price under one roof only got metro fitness retrofit this dot com\nEmployment first strives to include people with disabilities in the workplace the initiative benefits the companies that invest in people with disabilities and the employees the commonwealth qualified workers and self sufficient members as a community\nTurned a disability into an opportunity for more information regarding ADA P. dot ... dot edu call one eight hundred eight big sixteen Seventy five sponsored by the out on the council for developmental disabilities the Alabama disability Advocacy Program the ADA and this station\n[noise]\n\nWelcome back to the last segment of this hour we'll open up the phones will get to the top our hold on for me please help everybody's doing OK kind of bounce it around and I spent a weird way for me as I told you earlier um [noise]\nLet me say I read you the X. twenty two [noise] excuse me spotlight [noise] um I you know this is hope porn [noise] excuse me I Can't trim through\nIt seems to me that the biblical narratives says this isn't going to happen and I'm kinda I gotta tell ya given the choice I'm going to go with the Bible every time in the Bible says\nThat ...

everything you know\nWhat I had decided to get in light of recent job made with respect to Mars colony on Mars and thousand people remember coming home nationalize that because there was work with you on road to ask Thirteen questions\nYou get four minutes and ... each question\nAnd that's the last time I was just so either President Trump hours or replace\nIt ready I'm ready\nFor the first question or minutes how did you get started in ...\nAnd picked up a consumer Greg camcorder\nLived for Nineteen years and tried to get projects off the ground mainly psi phi movies uh that would tell the secrets and a fictional a premise and\nI picked up a consumer great camcorder and I decided to go to Europe a conferences and start to investigate I had been researching on the Internet and writing screenplays as well I uh basically reached a glass ceiling you could call it in Hollywood\nI couldn't get into the big boys game and so I uh basically decided to make my own short and documentaries and so I went to these conferences I put a camera in front of people's faces I had\nA background in journalism from college and uh also a sort of a heavily skate in eastern philosophy and political science and\nBasically ask the good questions like have you seen the new phone and\nA million and you know what I didn't hear you say is very important is it working ... hours and you know targeted media and the people who are not main street you actually got a true that the government was seeking to hot mhm\nYes and I also worked for ... says a contractor or right before I started Camelot so I also had some you might call equation I insider access um and that showed me a lot and I sort of fell in love with NASA the good intention some NASA but I was shocked\nBy how behind the times they really were and what the uh front agency they really were\nJewish way there are many many buildings along with NASA absolutely should be inspired by the ...\n[laughter] um well that gets into how deeply went to bring the public into the secret space program I can definitely tell you that there are lots of secret goings on on NASA basis a underground bases on and off the planet on NAFTA\nHas been side and the bad side like all organizations\nThat's excellent second question what is your secret space program and where\nWe on a secret government of arms that all governments subordinate to\nOkay well uh the secret space program is made up of\nBasically paper clip scientists that came over after World War two a that is not seize ex Nazis and\nTop officials in government agencies the usual suspects CIA ... sat around the best way to visualize the secret space program and the secret government which is unified behind the scenes and it is made up primarily of Russia at the United States Britain and uh\nCountries such as France Germany uh Australia New Zealand Norway\nIs China articles\nChina has their own secret space program uh\nAlso attempts to have there's a however I Believe the times we work with are the people from India\nAnd at times with China but not very often from what I'm getting there is a ... competition going on behind the scenes there was also a split within a secret government and within the whole of black projects secret space program to try to ask\nIf you think you asked how much money a year or whether we're spending almost got on budget or outside the u._s. government or just how much money a year would you say is being spent on both with secret stage all ram and interest you're underground will be associated with\nWhich ballpark figure just from the nearest throwing a well\nYeah but I can tell you that the disclosures of lord black heat in the house of lords are talking about what was in a sense uh let's see ... trillion and more uh trillions in trillions in in fact we're talking about a a\nHole financially that if I'm pretty much never ending in essence when I talk about the N Earl emblem of the octopus sitting on the world what you're talking about is the host parasite relationship so all\nMate here drugs child trafficking human trafficking Oregon ... organ trafficking um you're talking about a\nHigh new training programs you're talking about pure heart investments as one of the law that you grew up there and it all by well all trickles down in essence an off planet so we're even talking about gold being taken up planet and runways in South Africa for example\nTo feed other civilizations on other planets too also a he the coffers of what innocence or the ...\nI also we send our secret space programs are reporting to probably are some key in on a knocking an off world races that are actually launched down in Antarctica at this time as part of the Nazi base that when they are\nAll right let's hope that we have another another question well third question is all at when er when I was surprised when I saw it I had always known they lost his brother about it always know there aren't you tortured my goal one so we're like what I thought much\nMath is now in my head so let's talk about Nazis at NASA much talk about the degree to which the streets of dumb things but the American public absolutely not happy with big no\nWell the bottom of mine with NASA and secret space program and why should matter to Americans and the world in general is that there are the money is going and being funneled right into these programs and their children are also being accused of being a news trained a\nSegregated they pick the only the criminal to cram and bring them into the projects to work as scientists engineers to work on a planet et cetera et cetera a lot of my whistle blowers or those types of children who grow up in the program were spotted\nVery at a very young age they were talking about at NASA\nLearner von Braun usual suspects dealing with a you know the best um\nThese people were running NAFTA for many many years all during the Apollo space program for example you can\nChildren which is the day is what kind of person to gay is torturing\nPeople growing hybrids you don't mind doing this kind of a toss\nWell first of all you've got a lot of ... black projects leaves are experiments that are put together by scientists you got to understand the philosophy of why\nThey're into secret space program which has to do with creating a humanity three point out so if they are growing you know Oregon they're growing a nano they're they're doing super soldiers and creating all of these incredible hybrid humans are bringing in more ...\nMore eighty DNA and and doing a genetic engineering of humanity it's all geared to going out to space to conquering space to being the the civilization on top when we agree other civilizations out there and so this is an ongoing\nCircumstance that were part of already we are\nSo that we have a government so here is\nOne Congress has just been asked to under a new stage corps which to me it looks like a budget building exercise is completely out of touch with what's going on with the secret space program so should Congress perhaps they know\nOf the reptilian ruler ship of earth and that is so prevalent all over

widely in World War [laughter] you can't\nHelp but asking why they succeeded in causing or stopping number two reptilian agenda and are we looking at a bright future one we're no\nThank you will come back to that number ... ... what is a super soldier how many there are there where are they based and why would they matter two minutes\nOkay there's no way of knowing how many there are Robert Duncan

what they want to do is jump jump start the genome\nSo what we're what we're talking about super soldiers we're not talking about the so called hybrids soldiers that are ... out of the deep underground military facility and start treating us\nA well there you're talking about a winner in essence a these are these things that are are like ... a beans and also a\nCyber medics is going to be in you know there's been so many Hollywood movies made about this but universal soldier is one of the best movies showing this sort of Nazis going back to creating a super soldier I forget what the

kind of wonder why\nThe first part is called the war against America and I recommend that you watch it because they were announcing their intentions in this country for years before September eleventh\nAnd to thousands of people and packed auditoriums and you're going to see all of that and these documentaries and the second one it's a day of the nine eleven terror plot and they put it together was remarkable detail and pulling all punches\nAnd I'd like to hear a little bit more of that but there's also news today that I Would like to talk with our guests about\nSome great headlines today small business optimism highest ever tops Reagan\nThat's pretty significant you would think that a a man who was\n... oh I forgot I read over the weekend that Obama this is Obama's economy checking into high gear now after all those eight years of hard work I mean I agree with the fact that him leaving office at everything to do with the economy getting better [laughter]\nI don't know that this is his plan needed and cut taxes into corporate taxes they didn't give Americans more money to spend [noise]\nBut I find that the fact that optimism because I certainly felt fit in the eighties I Lived that I watch my income my income and the eighties grow from sixteen thousand dollars a year almost two hundred thousand\nAnd it just got better every year it was like wow I Hope they repeat the decade rather than go to the nineties right because the nineties ultimately sucked [laughter]\nIf I may have had a role you had one about his ... and ... yeah just a man that every now and say it was their fault\n[laughter] [noise]\nHow embarrassing in front of a guess we had it installed her reason [noise] keep me honest [laughter] ah but I\nWould think a president who has positioned the country [noise]\nSmall businesses the primary employers most people who are now taking more of their own money home they want a tax cut taxes again the Republicans to [noise]\nBe at all we hear is this non stop now we need the twenty Fifth Amendment because Donald Trump's crazy and when we got to replace them before you know he goes absolutely cuckoo in the White House ... it's it's pathetic and frightening at the same time\nIt's like there's the president come on give it a relief are crazy I heard him today talking about the plans they've got laid out to deal with these not just one but multiple hurricane situations he sounded pretty them down to earth and organize to me [noise]\nBut going back to that that should translate I Know it did for Reagan in his second to you know election you one forty nine out of fifty states only the brain frozen idiots of Minnesota\nSaid no because they had Walter Mondale and they're against it felt obligated I don't know how you would think with people feeling better about their personal incomes and talk to put this would be a no brainer but God Ninety percent of the coverage is negative and I think a lot of people are buying and what what are you saying [noise] well\nOne of the key differences with Reagan in that second term being that the Internet you had this ... you know you didn't have all of this these various mechanisms or ways to spin a\nCraziness like we do today\nOf [noise] of course you did have you know the the big three in terms of media\nBut even they couldn't deny I mean it was it back then it wasn't as hostile environment as it is today and if you look at what a what happened under Reagan and same thing that happened uh with Trump and the reason he won is because these decisions are made at the kitchen table and middle class America\nAnd the lower class who are looking for upward mobility improvements in their lives in terms of wages or a better life for their children are and that's where the vote\nAnd that's just just the bottom line and that's why I mean when you saw what happened under Reagan's economy when they brought tax rates down and we saw a that money began to really move in a in a true free market system that that you metric effect it had in the impact that it had on America\nWas so incredible um [noise]\nAnd it wasn't just economic I mean there was a real mood of patriotism sure and pride in the country are people getting health [noise] ah you know and um it was just a great time to be alive I remember very well myself because I was going into college and\nUh I was very helpful as a young man and um\n[noise] it was a fantastic time to be in this business because they hadn't deregulated and yet there was still tremendous competition\nOr was individual owners and companies I worked for our KO through most of the eighties they were fantastic company to work for [noise] and ah\nYou know in those days I was sort of a ... bad boy was a good thing you know uh\nAnd your stations would tolerate certain amount of that behavior because they knew if they let you go if your name was in the paper for good or bad reason somebody else it wasn't doing so well we pick you up at a second and more money\nIt was amazing now you know there's like we're so lucky to be here blue water all ownership we really are yeah\nUm that's not the case in most places there is no attempt to compete the way they used to be [noise] um so that's one fast and the other is and of course CBS had to twist is to make sure Trump got no credit whatsoever but in the middle class\nOr income is not returning to the level where it was in two thousand [noise] and I don't see Trump's name anywhere in this article [noise] um [noise]\nUh the poor are still they have to climb back I mean what does porn America\nThat's a really had an air conditioned car in the driveway [noise] um [noise]\nBut I wanted to thank you mentioned many times during especially the second term of Obama was the fact that a while there were certain stocks that were improving in economics\nPersonal and command that resin there hadn't been race for the average worker in many many years that's\nChanged it has it has been done to change and I think it's only beginning I think I think wage inflation is his real uh and very alive and you all you have to look at the numbers and you see the pressure uh we're in an incredibly tight labor market [noise] and um [noise]\nThat's the next story I wanted to get your opinion on that job openings climbed to record six point nine million\nRight as low as it is you don't have enough workers to fill these jobs\nBut guess what happens is here's what's going to the Democrats are going to freak out and they're going to try to come up with some micro management strategy around this\nUm their solution is to open the floodgates with immigration and bring them in and and\nPut them on ... and you know some sort of system subsistence type program and all of this kind of stuff but the thing is what you want is upward mobility you want these people leaving 'em ... these um [noise]\nI guess less than desirable jobs let's say they want to make more money they're going to go and get the training they need they're gonna try to apply for some of these jobs and they're going to get them and their lives are going to improve\nAnd oh by the way it there's no magic formula for this but the great spirit of entrepreneur is I'm In America is what really drives all of this it truly is you'll see a lot of these folks that are that\nAre looking for work will create entire new industries [noise] uh that we haven't even thought about today you know and so I\nJust believe that if we could um I think immigration is a big issue or in a big part of it if we can get that resolved that would help um but I think in general uh this this this situation has been a ride itself ... you get a smaller government less government less intrusive government\nAnd um I think that the power of the United states as an economic engine for the world with free market capitalism is going to solve a lot of problems I just believe that I've always believed that\nAnd um and so yeah I think that uh we you know we liked the wage numbers we liked the jobs numbers and seeing six point nine million jobs out there I mean that's got to be you think about\nPeople from Europe or parents in Europe and all over Asia or saying pack your bags go to America you know and and that's what's gonna happen\nWell nobody they keep saying we're anti immigration we want people who come here and take care of themselves who are prepared to emigrate to this country of some education yeah and a background check if you watch the godfather godfather part to\nPeek into immigration worked in those days you had to be healthy\nOr they detained you all of his hand wringing about what's going on at the border that is not an immigration center that's our border but there's no Ellis Island there there's no statue of liberty on the border\nThat's breaking and entering that's not immigration and it would be great to add ... you know educated people who could take these jobs and further grow the momentum of the

launched these buildings\nDown [laughter] do you ever get past that [laughter] I don't know if you get your mind around you actually saw that happen\nIs one thing to see it on TV that was well\nYeah plus ... my thoughts and Douglas Baltimore was the one who was born in one of the building there and he ... he was back waiting his building called the second plane to\nI mean you know just above his head and um I haven't had a conversation with him about it I I don't think many people who witnessed that are ... that really want to talk about it um [noise]\nEspecially when they stop people jumping from the building that what happened I mean that that that was probably and I do know some people that do that\nAnd and I heard them talk about that at and they just you know they're just [noise] I don't think people can I it's hard to believe it's been Seventeen years ago and I'm sure a lot of the country has forgot about it you know about the closest that brought us up\nTo you know there's also an identity politics that went out the window for a while\nRight and I and ... and last it lasted about four months until Chuck Schumer realized it didn't start going after Bush is gonna cost them from\nOnly had like a Ninety percent approval one yeah yeah yeah that's I knew people who were died and the little Democrats just said you know when I got to admit I'm Glad Bush was in there and

they drove all through you know Pennsylvania in the whole mid Atlantic Coast\nAnd I think that it was just unbelievable how many yellow ribbons and flags that were on the phone on I get choked

what it's going to do I\nHave tried to say thanks to everyone is interestingly Nike after that disastrous reaction to the camper neck and now their sales are up and they recoup their losses\nWhat does that mean [noise] well I don't you know I\nLike I was saying yesterday I don't think that the sales numbers that are going to really show up or began to really you know ... or get an idea of a trend\nOr until we get a full quarter behind us and um [noise] that's typically how these things go um one thing I Would say about that prior to this Nike had an incredible amount of momentum I mean they really did they they were really\nOr just blowing it out a top blonde revenue growth really quite impressive earnings unbelievable\nAnd so it's kind of like a [noise] you know a boat to go on a hundred miles an hour ... ... ... if if something's going to get in his way it doesn't just stop um [noise]\nIt's a it's going to coach for a while and so I don't know it it it also depends on\nHow ... Nike does after this are they going to continue to go down this theme or down this road with this type of theme or are they going to just sort of it's going to be one little little piece of marketing a bit to try to cover all their bases so to speak about their\nCosts is ... it's because it's Thirty years or just do it it's like thirty different athletes they're showcasing fry things like their idea was let's come out of the guy was controversy and like kind of make a splash and see where it goes from there [noise] so we'll see that I don't know I also\nThink that Nike is and I may be disagreeing with some of the news here but I think that they have more of it all inclusive or you know feels that the company they came out with these jobs for these ladies overseas to wear their athletic\nAnd things like that it's not just in America that they are kind of taking the next step forward and but I Would call race relations it's all over the country\nThere's still that paying

mountains here is\nLike Friedman said what is greed it's always the other guy who's greedy hit you know we should play that [laughter] but I Wish that both sides and see the same look you know ... states get invade he's happy Nike is definitely going to see a business a long term I Would assume so they're happy it's the people that come in on both sides and they're\nThey're mad that kept breaking payer they're mad Nike's benefitting off of something like this it's I see both I say to people benefitting off of the situation I don't see any reason for anyone to get mad I think they both

chance that we might get a little closer to the truth of what works amongst us and what is beyond I'm Connie Willis and this is coast to coast am\nMessaging theories may apply if you're considering going back to school I guess those are the following question do you need the flexibility to take classes on your schedule keyhole college credits you need transferred you want to earn a quality degree from a world renowned university if you answered yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school for you\nTo Arizona State university ... over a hundred and fifty highly ranked degree programs a hundred percent on line to learn the same degree as you would on campus from wherever you are on your schedule plus ask you one line except most transfer credits for information taxed now\nTwo three five five one seven learned for yourself by the wall Street Journal rings and seals in the nation from producing the best qualified graduates and white eighty seven percent of ASU grass I recruited within Ninety Days of graduation learn to grow learned to succeed and learned at the right at Arizona State university\nTo learn more about ASU online degrees taxed now two three five five one seven\n... that's N O W two three five five one seven\nAre you considering a straight to secure your valuables were firearms let's face it seeps are not very attractive but usually end up getting stuck in the garage to run a clause wouldn't it be great if there was a seats that I Do look beautiful and so you could\nAnd so one so partly the answer question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like ... if I'm traveling with my friends and family\nThey just sort of know that all been looking at goes again All right you know it's like they're like well give me a bit of the ... going to go to the beach and like that's really cool are you there was a monster there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos and so that that that's part of it is I've been able to double up a\nLot of my travels in South America and Africa notes where uh you know I I happen to be there any way and so I turned into investigation one I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean it just is what it is you just can't help but it's it's in your blood and eat that's what you do you you would if you weren't that beach hanging out there with them you would just be you're just dying\nI mean I can relax a little bit the despite you know just by one of my friends will tell you I can relax I can show but you know I'll give you one quick example I was in Newfoundland uh about ten years ago\nAnd that was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because uh there's been a series of lobsters are the that have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or wherever they are and they washed up there but uh I wanted to go investigate some of that and they're over Spring Hill jak citing up there but as I was up there I came across um a place called lake crafts and\nUm and it's this little you know new Finland is it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot\nBeing as you enter the town and the town is the populations like three or four or something [laughter] I rented a car I'm like I put on the brakes on but I gotta I I Can't pass a lake monstercom on site and my friends rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping for the biggest you know world's biggest um ball in the arm or something like that and say I'm with you [laughter] that's great stuff okay so\nI'm before I get along you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween so I\nGoogled that ... pounds your article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing your author of course but you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too\nBut I saw this crane articles for a meal and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know and solid looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody\nHis was writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so so tell me about the origins ... we're just now learning the organs and will is when they tell us the origins of wean\nThe ... that I I I Want the two hundred years from now when people were researching the orders is will if they're going to come up with this conversation hurry I'll love it my grandkids will be be all over it they'll be like that and\nI Know one of the things I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays mean your Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular or you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists gets all the the the conservative from time to get all touchy about that because they think it's really the the cold which not but it's it's it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into [noise]\nAnd that's why I really love Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy as a fascinating history\nI'm so basically Halloween a ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of full Couric these events and holidays there is not just one street lined back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime\nBut basically you can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic her daily festival called a so when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much of a friendship but just because it was that it was so long ago and there is no the the home of the records are pretty sparse fragmentary\nBut it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest and it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the sole says ... and at the time when I'm you know the the the snow's falling in you know plans are dying\nSo it had this connection to uh to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we like we think we think of the darkness as being you know something faster but to them there was a very it was much more of an an analyst point of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nUm and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it was scary it was like yes there was a time to you know to store it rains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the spirits and this and that [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the uh the the the separation between the world was especially thin and porous so the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and\nFerry boat or what have you there in their own world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day the the the the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise]\nUm and so this is why are they they began talking about how\nSpirits would or would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's are porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also in ... in leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that uh time is porous\nAnd so what you find is that a ... who would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when\nIt would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's our world and that there are there other worlds but it's also the barrier between the present in our future\nAnd so uh for example in Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs would there were involved the Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that the that uh for example woman born a Halloween would be able to tell the future [noise]\nUm and they would be the prophecy and oftentimes the prophecy a was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so it was it was often times there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would they would a light a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you the the the with the Republican mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\nUm and so all these sorts of another one example was bobbing for Apple you know every now and new apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition that if you cut a pie appealed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell out the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and past and present coming together\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night so I Do it and do it at midnight\nRight on willfully night\nThat's right will swing and well what about\nYou may you may have your own little um\nI'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know 'cause I I get there are people that say Halloween a Satan saying saying and and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that they're they're cool with it you know um but um you know I always see it as fun I see it\nAs a I I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think of fall whether I think an orange and black callers I think I think a little cartoons that we would watch like which is in the goblins\nAnd it'd be fun fun things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it and the traditions out of that and\nAnd uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here but what we have is a banner rapper with us he is an investigator and an end to all the things that were into a has coasts\nUm but he also you know there's a lot of writing and he looked into the Oregon so it's Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also goes hunting too so stay with his county well let's hear it's Willis renewed hanging and you don't know what you might hear tonight\n\nBeen so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get state panic in gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the ah\nTelevision shows around the time of Halloween uh that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff I don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of\nNormal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\n... you don't see any TV to go to target and put on you know a Batman mask I mean they may come out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and much smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love at all [noise]\nAbsolutely no I mean that that's one of them\nUm although you know Halloween was never really made me a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids it wouldn't kid centered as it is today a it was more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to go back to solve when and the the theory\nA Celtic versions of it which were very antagonistic and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness and snow and all that [noise]\nUm but you know so you you had that and then that sort of what happened was that um that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know will work obviously the next day\nWhich was an honor that the church a church members to gone to heaven\nAnd then also got wrapped up to a whole day which is November second which bills are wrong for the soul in purgatory\nAnd so there was this there were it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan\nUm um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that and then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all saints day\nAnd and they were bringing a bells and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away or demons and scary things could loud noise for such a scare away the evil [noise]\nUm and that sort of transformed a little later on into the modern costumes because what would happen is um ah you know because we are talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that uh during so into drew leaders would wear animal skins\nI'm there and sometimes the animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies and they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody knew they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm ... but then later on during the late Eighteen ... Seventeen hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food\nUm to the poor during Halloween for ... for the dead and this again to this ties back into all day because the idea was that um that on that day or the soul of the word purgatory you know there were they were basically trapped between heaven and hell they needed to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the the the wealthy members of the other communities would basically\nA higher out there were ... it was sub contract the prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for over ... full cakes where which type of bread and in return for paying for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs and rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food or or coin\nHum and often times they would care with them how to turn it of course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the the uh the public and um but the candle at land for the candle in it and the candles light represented the soul the person they were praying for\nThe idea was that they were these numbers go as far as to how say you know yes will pray for if you have a member of your family who's a who's passed on um new with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this late as the the soles ... who wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the turn of some sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me [laughter] that's when the pumpkins came in because the pumpkins associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and associate with the harvest and that's that sort of ...\nAgree with you turn it's now move on ... and Munch on with little olive oil salt and pepper I'm so worried about the candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in is that like right after the fifties like you were talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean ... it was interesting because it because again the it's sort of things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what happened is that if you think about it you know again that was the the mom and going on this that\nAnd then uh the the during this time the the jitters had pretty strict social and so\nUm and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would would ah would pining away with ... think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four of the time who knows\nWhat they did um but you know that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like\nDuring this time this is when people would go from house to house in the moment get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo if that was typically sort of a young men you know ... a mysterious young men project in the the the girls and women were tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the problems of those sorts of things so [noise] so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds of the traditional planning pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as the religious aspect sort of faded away for I mean they were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory [laughter] that's that's a little less a little a lot of outlandish for for a little too much work for these days\nSo that's when this sort of came down to treat a and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid\nA not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a memory you know every now I get to a good a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like really\nReally only a couple okay and I like it was the one that I like it was like some early tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that in mind you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go a long time ago it was great you remember the good houses together too because they were they were years where you would get full size candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that all\nHaunted house record where you heard the green in which is right and it was very dark so if you if you risk if you were brave enough to go to our house he would get full size bars you know marathon bars and you get your hands on\nYou're the only perimeter marathon bars I Love that I Love the marathon bars but they were like growl and chocolate and they they're like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great there ... there was I I haven't heard anybody mentioned those in decades\nOh that's a horrible ... you got a full one you gotta so long as you can't replace\nA wish I'd been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and and we had to go kind of far up one hill this way money all the other way and you had your boots on that's when they had those are nasty nasty you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time [laughter]\nBut we were there was like one house and all these had homemade popcorn balls they were delicious it was the only time we ever had on there were ...\nThe people and then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that they were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes [laughter] like I don't want to go there you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you\nI I should mention that because of all three answers the the ah the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the classic a poison ... and the reason I say yeah\nAnd the fact is that that I mean that's\nThat's there's there's almost no truth to that uh it's it's widely talked about a friend of mine Joel Best wrote a book about that um and and you know so when you actually look at at the cases where somebody who's actually painted these sorts of things\nUm if it happens very rarely there there was one case there but he points to\nAnd it was a case of a man and wrong wrong cargo Brian\nBreaking most deal has your favorite live music you would open might not

if you look at their logo to as an alien head with a\nI I didn't know that um that uh what's his face a lot fewer seats McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I Would probably be watching the fight\nYeah yeah yep yep ever on all the producers were were watching that\nSay hey you guys are going on the air now are so well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future in the same kinda part and all that good stuff\nNow another element is is some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kinda stuff\nAnd now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um um houses down the street that nobody that the abandoned homes or\nA ban in hospitals and things like that and they go inside these places and they use the ... board on Halloween Night or they or they use now all these different devices\nTo call upon spirits and goes now you have you have written quite a few books actually and you do a lot of writing and oh my gosh good for you I I despise writing that's why I like to talk\nMuch of a social life I'll just say that all with [laughter]\nI'd be like your let your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past and what the differences are now I think I found it interesting that you had said to me\nUh that uh people will go under cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to his spirit were years back people would get ... why would you want to talk to a stranger you know maybe call upon your family members somebody you know and that's true light\nUp you know\nNo that was that was that a lot of things that I uh when I was researching my book a investigating goes to those is basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact the dead I'm ranging from basically pre history\nA but primarily through the the the Victorian era upper upper today's you know goes hunters and all that\nAnd what you find that the the the idea that I mean you know people have been talking to the dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references in the which of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know your lady Macbeth I mean banquet was so there's there's there's there there's no shortage of go in and literature and history\nBut you know typically go or or if it's typically if people you want to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to me your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently ... and the the idea that somebody would\nGo into like a haunted house whether the models plantation or are you the Wally house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location and\nTalk to some random spirit that happens to be there and say Hi can you give us inside and you don't know me but tell me about yourself that that's that's a that's a relatively new phenomena hum and it's fast and you you know you go back and look at the the the onto that were held in in the Victorian era\nOffered in upper class uh places and they would have you know a lady you they they've Crumpet the tea and the and you know they try to communicate with the go and then\nYou had the the spiritual era [noise] um and you had people like Harry Houdini trying to research the Marjorie ... and all these spiritual if the you know came to the states and ... and and and they're you know their their stuff and so\nAnd then your hair your pride in his researching all that and then you sort of fast forward to uh the the the ... the idea and you know the old Johnny voice phenomena and the idea that you couldn't recording\nFrom basically a broken radio that switches channels and then you sort of fast forward to to the modern day goes to wonder what the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors all that\nAnd it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and went through techniques have been tried and and you know what works what doesn't and then how do we know\n[noise] yeah I think it's a you know it's already kind of creepy enough or spooky enough for even scary enough when you do get some sort of interaction when you were going to try to talk to spirit teachers\nUm it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further and they hope in pinch and you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction and you don't you don't know if it's going to be somebody nice or not and are these things go home with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a haunted house side of the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer going sledding or looking up in the sky lights I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um are you talked about exercises and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long and changes like you know folks quick provoking quit provoking you don't know who or what you're talking to not do that and that's what they were\nThere what's that\nYou're not doing yourself when he favors thereby ... whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is if it's evil or not evil or what it is at All right I mean um\nYou you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that scientifically\n[noise] ... there's a couple of things you know one of the first thing you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes missing agents myself\nUm and as I said I I come to the more science based or someone who's skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I disagree with everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe any we're sound as that goes and so for the first thing that I Do when I go into a case is try to establish\nA water the false viable claim that is what exactly is being claimed you know someone saying that there's\nThere's a mysterious sound or a laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and then the question is\nCan we tested and repeatable right is it is it the sound that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the go swimming you see on TV\nUh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality t._v. and creating the TV [laughter]\nReality [laughter] you know in in scary quotes um and I and I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a soft I've done you know on both sides of the camera on this\nAnd you know and my my point of view is always you know I I don't make fun of go because I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do the do it right\nYou know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem I often see is the goose hunters on TV and and not actually just across the board is is are you in this applies even you know an amateur groups across the country is they typically engage in what's called the nominally hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a ...\nOr you know ... or ...\nThey're ... they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around will try and promote goes no sort of things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we all look at this at ... pm I Am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate\nThe original claims there you you ... the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are any to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these sort of things\nAnd and and that that's part part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that\nThat in almost all cases\nThey don't they don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see a ghost hundred go into a location maybe there's a team of them and they'll you know they'll take readings for three hours or six hours or wherever else they'll go home and analyze them\nThe problem is that that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline\nRight in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal rap normally need to know what's normal\nAnd you whatever readings you get\nYour walking around with the M.

[noise]\n\nIt's coast to coast am Connie Willis here\nWill is wean is what's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator of the mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating ghosts and it's um\nIt's very interesting book talks about ah well what's what's bringing back on year then we were talking about uh how you investigate and how you first go in to an area where somebody says there's these things happening and I want an here's a question\nThat I Want to know that I I really don't know and a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know um when you look at a picture of photographs\nAnd someone says this is his picture I talk to you know some there's a lot of really great people out there that they really have things happening and they have great pictures of possibly something\nAnd I love that I mean we all want that but then there are some people out there that want to say things so when you do see a picture\nHow do you know what his photoshopped what is not photo shop what might just be a glitch ... what might be a\nMaybe a light reflecting off or the difference between an orbit and a piece of dust how the analyzing of photos tell us about that\nYeah I Know that's that's a good question I have to say that that um you know I've I've probably looked at a two or three hundred photographs or over the years people have sent me I'm\nI'm the same with the will to pick up on the on the default recipient of of ... photos [laughter] mangy dogs in Texas but I I have to clean up afterwards\nAnd I I have to say that I rarely encountered hoaxes um I have on occasion but I Would say probably Seventy to eighty percent of the food the ghost photos of them sent\nOur our ... people who just photographed something weird and they yeah they're not lying and they're not ... not ... they're like hey can I call them they're just like hey this is weird you know can you can you help me figure this out [noise]\nUm and so you know I go into each case ... you know trying to figure it out and to help them as best I can\nAnd so one of the things that I encourage them to do and I I Can't always do this myself because you are if if someone's in view a photograph I can just drop what I'm doing playoff to you know to Denver\nSays [laughter] well researchers go sort of like why not because I haven't trademark was Wayne and gun is off [laughter] to split it with me that's all I ask you know\nOf them is the is a a ... went one possible I tried to go to the the location or was filmed and try and figure it out so all you mentioned earlier um one case of them known for which is the Santa Fe courthouse coast case\nThat happened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital a which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was really strange glowing orbit thing that the cross this this railings camera [noise] um\nAnd it was you know it was it was seen by deputy uh so you know that there's probably [laughter] that would that make that gave them credibility right it's a deputy on the courthouse cameras so the likelihood of this being a hoax was was dropped off considerably at that point [noise]\nUm but what I ended up doing was ... I went to anyway so the story um it was made national news and people will read all of this weird thing over\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I I went up there and investigators night I went and I went to the courthouse and looked at the camera and I talked with the deputies I interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what might be um and I did some experiments I bench release all the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and he tried to figure out what or alternative explanations right so I usually I make a list of\nThree four or five different things you know could be could be an insect could be a hoax because it'd be a ghost is there is there something I mean so\nYou just basically any anything that he is even remotely possible I tried to list those and I tried to rank them in terms of what most likely which which things can I scientifically test which things can actually you know investigating falsify\n'em and you just basically go down the list and\nAnd that's that's one thing is I Do so so one key thing that the important uh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's the the photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell that came from [noise]\nBut but when possible it's good to try and replicated so you for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know are you are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of\nImage does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back in different states but I said well you know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and tried to replicate it you know take take ... take the photograph\nAt the same place ideally at the same time of day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that the you know might might be might be mistaken for a ... a an image of her face or something\nLike the cell and I get that I get that and but you know I guess that's it that thing whenever that might be in just they're like you said and it might be people might think\nWell I'll give you another example of what I was gonna\nSay you're one of it is um you know if it's on the one question comes up as the other people see it right and so this is right there is often the case of where\nYou know there's there's an extra for example behind standing behind somebody a and actually I was sent to an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this is the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there was a sort of weird goes the image a room just behind her to the left\nUm you what do you think it is I said well again I I was\nBut I noticed that no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who are or nearby and no one is looking at this strange image to the left and so that suggests that they probably didn't feed at the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI Gotcha I Gotcha and you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see what the I in some things are picked up from a certain angle but not another angle um they mean it's just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that it just is\nThe way the shadow is and just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked out that that's I mean it looks like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know worthy of\nA saying at this place was hunting for sure so you talk about uh goes hunting equipment to man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure right now it's all a new science you know\nYeah I mean you know one of the interesting aspects of gross domestic Asian is um is the uh you know a ... for example I was I was doing a teenager who called the mystery quest a while back and I was there was some uh goes hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and\nAnd they they brought in all this all these are the ghost during the equipment and just you know there's cameras in him after all is like you know probably Seventy thousand dollar of all the gear\nAnd it was all set up when the cameras and lights and our and all that sort of thing\nAnd and I talked to one of the guys who brought all this stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera ... this was in like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out we were finished shooting or going back hotel is it I said why do you think\nWhy do you think it is that that we don't we still don't have good quality evidence of goes\nUh I mean even to this day and again this is you know six seven years ago so you know even the the evidence of getting a better it's all these blurry or business not and he said well I think that I think the problem the basic problem is that ... that we don't have the technology to the coast\nAnd I said yeah but if that's true if you believe that then why why sprint or did you bring in Seventy thousand dollars worth of man

going to be but it was going to go to the beach and like that's really cool are you there is a monster there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos\nAnd so that that that's part of it is I've been able to double up\nA lot of my travels in South America and Africa notes where uh you know I I happen to be there any way and so I turned into investigation one I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean it just is what it is you just can't help but it's it's in your mind ... that's what you do you you would if you weren't that beach hanging out there with them you would just be you're just dying\nI Swear I can relax a little bit the despite you know just by one of my friends will tell you I can relax hiking trail but you know I'll give you one quick example I was in Newfoundland or about ten years ago\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because ah there's been a series of lobsters are the that have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or wherever they are they wash up there but uh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and then it over the Spring Hill jak signing up there but I thought it was up there I came across um a place called lake crescent\nUm and it's this little you know new Finland is it's beautiful it's just you know it just crevices and everything and turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a good one\nThing for this thing as you enter the town the town is the populations like three or four or something [laughter] I rented a car I'm like I put on the break but I got a I I Can't pass a lake monster come on and I and my friends rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping for the biggest world's biggest a ball of yarn or something like that great I'm with you [laughter]\nThat's great stuff okay so I'm I'm before I get along you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween so\nI Googled that ... found your article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing your author of course but you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too\nBut I saw this great article from you and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know and saw looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody\nHis was writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so so tell me about the origins and we're ... we're just now learning the origins of the will of swing the jealousy origins of Halloween\nSee there's ... I I I Want the two hundred years from now when people are researching the orders will if they're going to come up with this conversation great I'll love it my grandkids will be be all over it it'd be like\nNo I work with one of the things that I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun ... but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular or you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists 'cause the the the conservative sometimes get all touchy about that because they think it's really the the ... which is not but it's it's what it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into [noise]\nAnd that's why I really love Halloween is it's it's more just costumes and candy as a fascinating history\nI'm basically Halloween a ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of full Couric these events and holidays there is not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime\nBut basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic her daily festival cold or so when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much of a French about just because it was that it was so long ago and there's no the the home of the records are pretty sparse fragmentary\nBut it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the sole says ... and it's a time when I'm you know the the the snow's falling in you know plans are dying so it had this connection to uh to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standard when we can we think we think of the darkness as being you know something faster but to them there was a very it was much more of an an analyst point of view wasn't about death or evil with the changing of the seasons\nUm and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it wasn't scary it was like yes there was a time to you know to a store a grains and to give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this man [noise]\nUm and it was believed that a bit on that day that the uh the the the separation between the world was especially thin and porous so the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little\nAnd you know the the ferry boat or what have you there in their own world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day the the the er the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise] um and so this is why are they they began talking about how\n[noise] here it's worth the would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's are porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also in leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that uh time is porous\nAnd so what you find is that a whole would later become Halloween um they would be a it would be basically a time when\nIt would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's our world and that there are there other worlds but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so uh for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that would that were involved Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that the that are on for example woman born a Halloween would be able\nTo tell the future um and they would be this a proxy and oftentimes the prophecy\nA was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it ... you know oftentimes there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would they would a light a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with the Republican mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\nUm and so all these sorts of another one example was bobbing for Apple you know if you're down near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition that if you cut a pie appealed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and past and present coming together\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] I Do it at midnight\nRight now on willfully night\nThat's right will swing and [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um\nI'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know 'cause I I get there are people that say Halloween a saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that they're they're cool with it you know um but um\nYou know I always see it as fun I see it as a\nI I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o' lantern that you get to make I think of whether I think in orange and black collars yeah I think I think a little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins and\nAnd it'd be fun fun things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and all of a sudden they kicked the fun out of it and the traditions out of that and\nAnd uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're going to have to take a break here but what we have is a banner rapper with us he is an investigator and and into all the things that were into uh\nWhere are you seeing 'em but he also you know there's a lot of writing and he looked into the origins it's Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also goes hunting too so stay with his county well let's hear it's Willis renewed hanging there you don't know what you might hear tonight\n\nBend so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and gets they panic and gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the ah\nTelevision shows around the time of Halloween uh that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the ah great I'm In and all that kinda stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dressed up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that anytime of the year\nAnd we don't see any creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman mask I mean they may come out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love it\nAll\nSo see of course these days um although your Halloween was never really made me a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty before that it was I mean kids are involved but it wasn't really a kids it wasn't kid centered as it is today\nA it was more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to go back to solve when and the the the ... a Celtic versions of it which were very anti mystic and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness in snow and all that [noise]\nUm but you know so you you had that and then that sort of what happened was that um that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which is November first which was you know will work obviously the next day which was a to honor that the church a church members bleed to have gone to heaven\nAnd then also got wrapped up to a whole whole day which is November second which bills are wrong for the soul in purgatory\nAnd so there was this there were it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan\nUm um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that and then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church but it's all ... day\nAnd and they were bringing a bells and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noise for such a scare away the evil [noise]\nUm and that's where it transforms a little later on into the modern costumes because what would happen is\nUm ah you know because we're talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that uh during so into drew leaders would wear animal skins I'm there and sometimes the animal heads like gamblers whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody knew they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen at least the Seventeen hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy members in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween preparing for the dead and this again the ties back into all sold day because the idea was that\nUm that on that day or the ... the word in purgatory you know they were they were basically trapped between heaven and hell they needs to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the the wealthy members of the other communities would basically a higher out there were ... they would subcontract prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called full cakes where which type of bread\nAnd in return for paying for a for praying for those in purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs and rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn it of course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the the uh the public and\nUm but the candle at land for the candle in it and the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for\nThe idea was that they would these numbers go have found to have say you know yes will pray for if you have a member of your family who's a you who's passed on um new with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this late as the the ... the coach wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the tournament ... sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me [laughter] and that's when that's when the pumpkins came in because the pumpkins associate of course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and their associate with a ...\nUm oh I like that yeah I\nAgree with you turn it's now move on ... and Munch on with little olive oil salt and pepper I'm so worried about the candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in is that like right after the fifties like you were talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean ... it was interesting 'cause it 'cause they're getting the ... it's sort of the things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is that if you think about it you know again there was the ... the mom and going on this and that\nAnd then uh the the ... during this time the the jitters had pretty strict social and so\nUm and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would would would pining away with fully think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four of the time who knows\nWhat they did\nUm but you know that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like during this time this is when people would go from house to house in the ... the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token of something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo if that was typically sort of a young men you know ... a mixture of this young man's project and the the the girls and women were tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the process of those sorts of things so [noise] so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold and purgatory [laughter] that's that's a little a little a lot of outlandish for a little too much work for these days [laughter]\nSo that's when the verdict came down to treats and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid\nA not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like really\nReally only a apple okay and I like it was it wasn't even that I like it was like some early part apple like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that in mind you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go I'm a long time ago it was great you remember the good houses together too because they were there were years where you would get full sized candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that all\nHaunted house record where you heard the green and then which is right and it was very dark so if you if you risk if you were brave enough to go to our house he would get full size bars you know marathon bars and you get your hands on\nYou're the only perimeter marathon bars that I Love the marathon bars but they were like growl and chocolate and they they were like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're just there was I I haven't heard anybody mention those in decades oh now that's\nA horrible ... you got a full one you got a phone one is you can't replace\nA wish I'd been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and and we had to go kind of far up the hill this way millennial the other way and you had your suits on that's when they had those are nasty nasty you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time [laughter]\nLike we were there was like one house it always had homemade popcorn balls they were delicious it was the only time we\nYou could trust the people and then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that they were a dentist and they only gained the weight toothbrushes like out there you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI should mention that because of all three answers the the the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the the classic a poison ... and the reason I say yeah\nAnd the fact is that that I mean that's\nThat's there's there's almost no truth to that uh it's it's widely talked about a friend of mine Joel Best wrote a book about that um and and you know so ... what do you actually look at at the cases where somebody who's actually painted these sorts of things\nUm if it happens very rarely there there was one case there what he points to\nAnd it was a case to a man and wrong wrong cargo Brian uh who killed his own by releasing his pick to stick to assign I meant to say no or\nAll while serving in your own community log on to

they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um\nUm houses down the street that nobody the abandoned homes or a ban in hospitals and things like that and they go inside these places and they use the ... board on Halloween Night or they or they use now all these different devices\nTo call upon spirits and goes now you have you in Britain quite a few books actually and you do a lot of writing and oh my gosh good for you I I despise writing that's why I like to talk [laughter]\nMuch of a social life I'll just say that all with [laughter]\nI'd be like you let your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past and what the difference is now I think I found it interesting that you had said to me\nUh that uh people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to a spirit were years back people would go well why would you want to talk to a stranger you know maybe call upon your family member or somebody you know and that's true why do\nYou call it up you know [laughter] I\nKnow that was that was ... when the things that I uh when I was researching my book are investigating goes to those is basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact the dead I'm ranging from basically pre history\nA but primarily through the the er the Victorian era upper upper today's you know goes hunters and all that\nAnd what you find is that the the idea that I mean you know people have been talking if it did for millennia I mean that's you know there's references in the which of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know your lady Macbeth I mean banquet was so there's there's there's there there's no shortage of go in and literature and history\nBut you know typically go or or if it's typically if people want to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to me your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently ... and the the idea that somebody would\nGo into like a haunted house whether the models plantation or are you the Wally house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location\nAnd talk to some random spirit that happens to be there and say Hi can you give us inside and you don't know me but tell me about yourself that that that's a that's relatively new phenomena hum and it's it's fast and you know you go back and look at the the the onto that were held in in the Victorian era\nOn off in an upper class uh places and they would have you know a lady that they they were Crumpet the heat and the and you know they try to communicate with the ghosts and then\nYou had the the spiritual era [noise] um and you have people like Harry Houdini trying to research the Marjorie ... and all these spiritual if the you know came to the states and Kate McGee Fox and and and they're you know their their stuff and so\nAnd then your hair your pride in his researching all that and then you are a fast for two of the the the ATP idea and you know the old Johnny voice phenomena and the idea that you can record it\nIf you're a broken radio that switches channels and then you sort of fast forward to\nTo the modern day goes on her with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors and all that and it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and look through techniques have been tried and and you know what works what doesn't end and how do we know\n[noise] yeah I think it's a you know it's already kind of creepy enough spooky enough or even scary enough when you do get some sort of interaction when you are going to try to talk to spirit teachers\nUm it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further and they\nHope in pinch and you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction and you don't you don't know if it's gonna be somebody nice or not and are these things go home with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a haunted house side of the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer going sledding or looking up in the sky lights I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um are you talked about ... and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long and changes like you know folks quick provoking quick provoking you don't know who or what you're talking to\nNot do that and that's what they were there which that you're not doing yourself when he favors thereby proclaim whatever may be there\nRight you don't know what it is if it's evil or not evil or what it is at All right I mean\nUm you you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that scientifically\n... there's a couple of things you know one of the first thing you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes ministry Asians myself um and as I said I I come to the more science based or someone who skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I\nDisagree with everything it just means that you know I couldn't believe anywhere you sound as that goes and so for the first thing that I Do when I go into a case is try to establish a water the false viable claim that is what exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's\nThere's a mysterious sound or a laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and then the question is\nCan we tested and repeatable right is it is it is the sound that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the go swimming you see on TV\nUh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality\nTV and creating TV reality\nYou know in ... quotes um and I and I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a soft I've done you know on both sides of the camera on this\nAnd you know and my my point of view is always you know I I don't make fun of both of them because I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do than do it right\nYou know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem I often see is that go centers on TV and not actually just across the board is is are you in this applies even you know an amateur groups across the country is they typically engage in what's called a nominally hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know maps or magnetic\nEnvironment looking for something weird and they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around we'll try and promote goes a little sort of things and then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them\nAnd they try and look for anything we're all look at the it it's ... pm I Am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate\nThe original claims they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are any to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that\nThat in almost all cases\nThey don't they don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample location so for example you'll see a ghost hundred go into location maybe there's a team of them and they'll they'll take readings for three hours or six hours whatever else they'll go home and analyze them\nThe problem is that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline\nRight in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal rap normally need to know what's normal\nAnd you know whatever readings you get\nYour walking around with the M. F. detector magnetometer whatever it is what a breathing as you get over that six hours that there could be normal variation that you want to see only happens once a week or something\nIs Benjamin ran for that we're talking to and we're learning about\nMinutes good safety Fifteen Percent or more on motorcycle insurance [noise]\n[noise]\n\nIt's coast to coast am county Willis here\nWill is wean is what's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating dose and it's um\nIt's very interesting book it talks about ah well what's what's bringing back on year then we were talking about uh how you investigate and how you first go in to an area where somebody says there's these things happening and I mean here's a question\nThat I Want to know is that I I really don't know and a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know um when you look at a picture of photographs\nAnd someone says this is a picture I took ... you know some ... there's a lot of really great people out there that they really had things happening and they have great pictures of possibly something\nAnd I love that I mean we all want that but then there are some people out there that want to say thanks so when you do see a picture\nHow do you know what his photoshopped what is not photo shop what might just be a glitch ... what might be a\nMaybe a light reflecting off or the difference between an orbit and a piece of dust how the analyzing of photos tell us about that\nYeah I Know that that's a good question and I have to say that the um you know I I probably looked at a two or three hundred and photographs or over the years people have sent me I'm\nI'm a same with the will to pick up on the on the default recipient of of trip a cup of photos [laughter] mangy dogs in Texas but I I have to clean up afterwards\nAnd I I have to say that I rarely encountered hoaxes hum I have on occasion but I Would say probably Seventy to eighty percent of the food the goes photos of them sent\nOur our ... by the people who just photographed something weird and they yeah they're not lying there not too much not Trump one over on me they're like hey can I owe him they're just like hey this is weird you know can you can you help me figure this out [noise]\nUm and so you know I I go into each case ... you know trying to figure it out and to help them as best I can\nAnd so one of the things that I encourage them to do and I I Can't always do this myself because you are if if someone some of the photograph I came to drop what I'm doing playoff to you know to Denver\n[laughter] researcher goes photos much why not because I haven't trademark was Wayne and gun is up [laughter] to split it with me that's all I ask you know but it's um [noise] so so there's a couple of days\n... tried to go to the the location or was filmed and try and figure it out so all you mentioned earlier um one case that I'm known for which is the Santa Fe courthouse ghost case\nThat happened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital or which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was really strange glowing orbit thing that the cross this this railings camera [noise] um\nAnd it was you know it was it was seen by deputy uh so you know that there's probably [laughter] that would that make that gave some credibility right it's a deputy on the courthouse cameras so the likelihood of this being a hoax was was dropped off considerably at that point [noise]\nUm but what I ended up doing was ... I went to him I said the story um it was made national news people read all of this weird thing move a\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I I went up there and investigators night I went and I went to the courthouse and looked at the camera and I talked to the deputies interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be\nUm and I did some experiments I eventually solved the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and he tried to figure out what her alternative explanations right so I usually I make a list of\nThree four or five different things you know could be could be an insect could be a hoax could be a ghost is there is there something I mean so\nYou just basically any anything that he is even remotely possible I tried to list those and I tried to rank them in terms of what most likely which which things can I find typically test which things can actually you know investigating falsify\n'em and you just basically go down the list and\nAnd that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the important and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's the the photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell they came from [noise]\nBut but when possible it's good to try and replicate it so you know for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know are you are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was just sort of image does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back and different state but I said\nWell you know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and tried to replicate it you know take take ... take the photograph\nAt the same place ideally at the same time of day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be might be mistaken for an ... an image of a face or something\nThe cell and I get that I get that and but you know I guess that that thing whenever that might be just they're like you said in it might be people might say well I'll give you another example of what\nWas going to say one of it is um you know if it's on the one question comes up at the other people see it right and so this is right there is often the case of where\nYou know there's there's an extra for example behind Sandy behind somebody a and actually I was sent to an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this was the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there was a sort of weird goes the image a room just behind her to the left\nUm you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of different you know it's hard to be conclusive about it\nOwned them noticed it I mean there there are other people who are or nearby and no one is looking at this strange image to the left and so that suggests that they probably didn't feed at the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI Gotcha I Gotcha and you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see what the I in some things are picked up from a certain angle but not another angle um they mean it's just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that it just is\nThe way the shadow is and just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked out that that's I mean it looks like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know worthy of\nA saying at this place was hunting for sure so you talk about uh goes hunting equipment to man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure right now it's all a new science you know\nYeah I mean you know one of the interesting aspects of gross domestic Asian is um is the uh you know a ... for example I was I was doing a teenager who called the mystery quest a while back and I was there with them a ghost hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and\nAnd they they brought in all this all these are the ghost during the equipment and just you know there's cameras in him after all is like you know probably Seventy thousand dollar of all the gear\nAnd it was all set up when the cameras and lights and I are and all that sort of thing\nAnd and I talked to one of the guys who brought all this stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera ... this was in like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out we were finished shooting or going back hotel is it I said why do you think\nWhy do you think it is that that we don't we still don't have good quality evidence of goes uh I mean even to this day and again this is you know six seven years ago so you know even\nThe the evidence of getting a better it's all these blurry or business nut and he said well I think that I think the problem the basic problem is that ... that we don't have the technology to the coast\nAnd I said yeah but if that's true if you believe that then why why sprint or did you bring in Seventy thousand dollars or the man

I Am ... and I'm excited to introduce my new radio show called what's working with ... we'll dig into the trends that are shaping today's workplace and workforce Saturdays twelve noon on news talk Ninety three point one FM\n[noise] have\nTime for legends of success with John resident each week Sean resistance to most original success stories in America passionate and inspiring stories from some of the most innovative as successful entrepreneur is alive today this is ... years John resident\nAnd want\nThem to today's edition of legends of success program that introduces you to America's most respected entrepreneur and acclaimed individuals as a share with you there personal journeys of overcoming obstacles him set\nSome make it to the top I'm John Resnick and thanks again for sharing part of your day with us you know folks every time I read our upcoming guests list I'm really still amazed at who were able to introduce you to use those success stories on one station in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania\nWhich your host having no prior experience on the air and I'd never interviewed anyone in my life\nWell we're a bit of blessed we are now on stations across the country and we've had more exclusive interviews with billionaires in for four hundred members than any talk radio show in America it doesn't matter who John Resnick or any other host is without those gassed you can't grow this kind a program\nWhich leads me to today's guest I placed a cold call to Texas billionaire read my column read was the owner of NFL Minnesota Vikings and the cofounder of Clear Channel communications and one of the top five Automobile Dealers in America\nAnd he had no clue who John Resnick was this man had absolutely nothing to gain by coming on my local radio show and central Pennsylvania but thank God he did because I credit Redmond comes as a critical factor in our continued growth\nLet's welcome are real taxes tycoon and cowboy and our dear friend read my columns read welcome\nAnd to see that you've had such success and I think that uh you need to give yourself a battle of the bag because you're providing positive stories and positive programs are for people that can affect their lives and it's the end of the day that's what counts well\nRead your your very humble when you say that because let's face it a a man of your stature and diversification in life you didn't need to do it just out of curiosity why did you come on the program is certainly didn't need to read\nI came on because of the lead in that you're left with my secretary was that you wanted to do a radio show and talk about a positive things that that could affect people positively based on your own personal experience reading that yeah that you were going to interview\nI found that interesting and uh if if anything I have to say could benefit of the one I was happy to share it with you\nWell we appreciate it and I speak on behalf of each and every one of our listeners read you a great guy and before we get into your story a little bit I Need to congratulate you I understand you've had a pretty big payday why don't you tell us about that\n[noise] well I sold the Minnesota Vikings at on them for seven years\nAnd it was one of the great joys of my life to be able to do that I've been a professional sports team owner for most of the past fifty years\nBut I had not been able to get an NFL team it was a great experience\nAnd and some of the principles in life as he said a growing up his parents trains or where it was so important\nPlace in the Forbes of four hundred year recognize as one of America's billionaires we grow up it wasn't like that did you see yourself as different teachers stink different did you visualize it OK I'm here temporarily but I'll be out of here one day\nNo not at all as a matter of fact I enjoy the environment that I was raised in I enjoyed the growing up in a while I'm going to have a perfect situation uh we realized that the countries in the depths of depression a lot of people to nail jobs and that there were problems I'm always a was a\nWas a just instilled in me with with every sense of the fiber\nIn my family from mom and my dad was that education was the key to that\nThe benefits of of a good life for the benefits of your life would be that would benefit you\nAnd then you could pass on a benefit to others so education was always a big thing we're fortunate we had very good public schools in our little town and I was fortunate I got to go to college on football scholarship and then the GI Bill from army service\nSo I was able to get an education and uh it uh it was very important it's very important to all of us I talked to a lot of kids groups of these days and try to instill in them the importance of\nThis thing in school another week ... whatever it is if you get out you don't feel like you can spend four or five years in college a spin one years he can't do that spin one semester\nBut goes every day will pay off for you every day that you can get the more formal education you get the better you be\nSo uh yes we add obstacles we really didn't see them as as much a\nA as I guess that they might have been and maybe that kind of positive outlook or play the good role and what we're able to do\nWell it's it's a it's obviously affected in some positive lay and many positive ways you are as as a young man a young boy you are entrepreneurs entrepreneurial almost from the beginning work ...\nHours I didn't even know how to spell the word was much less a ah understand what he was but I was always fascinated about how things work out is that\nHow does it Gabby a bank or how do you get to how how does this happen um how's it going to get to own his own business or whatever the business is I was always fascinated by it always tried to\nTo watch them understand as much about it as I could last they all have that same fascination today is approach the age of Seventy eight or I'm fascinated about how things work I'm fascinated about how Donald how Mr del up in the market will develop and often I'm\nI'm a ... a\nBuilding computers and found a way to out do everybody in the world it's fascinating I still try to learn about all those like\nYou know it's interesting to read because a lot of people say here this all the time they say well you know what they did before it can't duplicate or replicate today my my opinion is you can make much bigger fortunes much faster in today's world you agree\nOr I totally agree and and their lives and other key element that\nThat you have such a such a premium these days are being young [noise] uh gives you an advantage not a disadvantage and that is just another thing I think that ...\nAre just so positively or for all of the young people that are coming on and and tackling the various elements of of careers in one way or another because there is a premium on youth and and ah it shows so I think that\nI I think we're living in the very best of times we should understand\nThe sea that we enjoy we enjoy a good share of it\nAbsolutely you know going back to when you were about age ten you had a very simple entrepreneurial jobs created I'm I'm selling peanuts but I think he learned a couple of valuable lessons side of that talk about\nThat I did I learn to a lesser the minute or if you put too many peanuts in the sack when you get them through you get a lot of Nichols with is not enough to pay for all your ... so what happened so what happened was convinced rather than to go by me another hundred pounds of peanuts and he said we've already tried that and he said it didn't work very well\nBut I said well give me a chance of I'll make it work\nSo I'm an avid many peanuts and this and I I never had any complaints from my customers and I made some money so I you know you learn a lot of lessons as you as you move through laugh I learned a lot of lessons early ages and I was to learn them today\n[laughter] you know you also said I mean from that experience I had a quote from your book called the red zone you said if he ... he said the first rule of private enterprise you identify in need and you know or the buyers are all dismissing as the product and I think that you you mentioned that's what you learned I guess from that peanut business that is correct\nYour mom is quoted as also saying or your mother said I gave birth to them and raise them but I've never known what made that boy tech [laughter] you you were on like the rest of the family will take it\nOut you know I I was a little bit more passionate about about the the things that I wanted to do and and I'm a that was so that that's just been a part of my life I have always been passionate about the things I Do have always enjoyed the things\nThat I Do not that there haven't been problems are the issues that come up as they always do\nBut um [noise] uh the the the ... this is a God created all of us equal certainly in one respect and that is\nThat he gives all of us this twenty four hours of today it's a gift we didn't learn it so that that we deserve it it's God's Gift or so the issue is nobody else gets any more than twenty four hours today I get the same as you do everyone else gets the same issue is what do we do with it\nAnd that's that's what's kind of driven my alive and uh it's it's it's worked very well for me\nI guess so many people like you were saying the you know you there's a premium on youth because\nUnfortunately many people don't realize how valuable that head start that advantage is that they have now until maybe it's too late or or they wasted a lot of that but that's just typical isn't it rests\nWhat it is you know we're always going to find people who are who you are more concerned about the things than others and [noise] and uh they're always going to be some people it will finish the hand of others and that doesn't mean though that you can still do well in the race of the big thing is is to get in the race and be a part of a\nRegular originally going to be a lawyer one happened\nWell I found out and as I was finishing my second year in law school I found out that\nThat the that profession in Nineteen fifty a really didn't pay much and the hours I was working two or three jobs on the campus and I was doing I found out that I was making more money than than starting lawyers or at that time an\nOld it discouraging anyone from the from the field of law it's a fantastic field and we all know that but in my world I was in a hurry and I just felt like I needed to to move away from la and move over to the business side\nRed isn't that one of the common denominator ... most successful entrepreneur as what you really alluding to hear you in a sense of urgency to get out and earn a living to absolutely and and that made a big difference in other words you didn't at that point the patient\nTrack or I can get out and get into business and what did you do you quit law school you left law school where did you do what you do ...\nWell I got a corporate job through the University of placement service and I have about six weeks before it open for my training class open\nIn the meantime I had a friend or a in Corpus Christi Texas rose my parents were living at the time that was the selling new for Jamaican Vince ... to come down and and the work with them\nA for a few weeks before I'm a corporate job opened up and I found out real early own within two or three weeks I really enjoyed selling cars\nOr so or a cold and the object out of um a corporate job in but yeah I'm selling cars like selling cars I did very well at it\nUh within three years I've been able to save some money and convince a banker that I was a was worthy of a bank loan at age twenty five I got into the used car business and then I got into\nMore used car businesses and then I got into the franchise business and and the automobile business has really been the basis of a lot of other things that have been a part of my life\nAnd obviously you were very successful from the beginning again in your book the red zone you stated that back then the average here and it's a month maybe sold by salesman were ten after you were in the business three weeks you set a goal and you hit thirty one car sales in the next thirty days which is pretty incredible starting out as much\nOil was and I found out that really is about as easy to sell a a thirty one of the month as he was just so damn it all was a matter of\nOf just getting into your mind what your opportunities we're in a in a utilizing the skills that your head and it works very well and we've been able to pass that onto a lot of people have\nI have had the privilege to three mile\nBridge car dealerships of of training over one hundred a young guys that went on to be dealers themselves and have done very well\nInteresting we've had a number a guest on a who also attained high levels of success and number of them and said what are you going into business plan for it to take twice as long and twice as much money than you ever initially thought\nYeah I don't really plan that would have a plan that a plan that we are going to a vote of almost immediately case flu and again most of the times that make it work you know sometimes I don't\nHave you sold any business I'm sure you have you had those sold opportunities that you had old\nA lot of businesses that didn't work well for me that the other guy that got it made it work very well absolutely I Can't say that that I have any ... I Can't say that everything that I Do those work well it doesn't but when it does a a um uh they usually they'll say with a very long\nBut that's pretty cool but but you sit in your own format and you're not going to deviate or that's correct that's very interesting um [noise] what are they are two or three critical factors read that you look for in a deal two or three things that you always look for\nWill forest you've got to have a product or service that you believe in\nAnd that you're excited about yourself and you can't just sell yourself ... you got to really be excited about it and if you get excited about it and you look and see how much of a mortgage you got to sell this\nProduct and then you look and see Oregon you get very talented people to come help you nobody can do it by yourself so do you have something that's attractive in a store you can go\nAnd encourage people to come and join you or your organization it'd be a part of it and if you have those basic components

C. the ... uh he was talking about a three point one FM\nRiverside Chabrel by\nTo viewpoint [noise] Montgomery longest running local talk show\nFocusing on community events and public service [noise]\nYour host Joey Clark\nGood morning and welcome to the point I'm your host Julie courts and it's going to be a wonderful show this morning because I'm working welcoming back somebody has become a recurring guess\nGreat acquaintance good friend here\nIn the river region that's Leslie more corona with hands on her region how are you this morning Leslie I'm doing great jelly how are you I'm fantastic other than my my furs everybody that yeah there's all sorts of stories that we don't have time for folks because we have more it's more important things in my uh physical ailments\nA we have well\nFirst off it's a little early this year\nThe Christmas clearinghouse it's really not cuter ... it's good to get planning because it's already the month of October I've already got on my Christmas shopping so all I have with a very wide ... head\nThe November will be gone before you know it and Christmas will be here the end of December before you know and it's already the holiday season\nIt's ramping up so it's good to start planning ahead\nAnd so for folks out there who don't know what the Christmas clearing house is done through hands on river region is a sort of a one stop shop that you're making sure that you're not duplicating efforts too much that were sort of realizing oh everybody's coming together\nAnd we're finding particular families in need and we're making sure that it you know there's no belly who hear the leaf family's actually are definitely\nYes we do we do clear all the names of people that are applying for assistance the various organizations in the river region cleared those names to make sure there's no duplication of effort\nAwesome so what are some of the organizations that sort of team together they come to give them up and one name he'd probably notice twice for taught the Marines and and Salvation Army numerous churches other nonprofit organizations that the shelters in Montgomery\nAnyone who has clients who are in need that will be I'm requesting assistance during the holidays and other times throughout the year and so the general idea of the Christmas clearing houses you can do general donations correct absolutely well we we ideally\nLike to have families or groups where you want to adopt to fame okay ... so that they can actually request a certain type of thing\nFather or whatever you know whatever circumstances that might be near and dear to their heart that uh you can actually donate funds toys or adopted family\nWonderful okay well I mean it doesn't have to be Christmas Time angel river regions always looking for this will go to the Christmas clerk house though because it usually or pacify that right okay and you can general toys out there and\nOne thing that we have done the last several years is the care of the care baskets because we found that families a lotta times can't purchase items that they need just for general household use with food stamps I mean you'd be shots at what brings his desk without by they can't buy so they can't buy the charge it can't buy diapers\nUm paper towels sell a lot of times when people adopt families they will actually donate a big laundry basket filled with household items and personal hygiene items\nSo when you adopt a family and see the you know a ton diet hands on river region your hands on her origin dot org and ... all the information's there I adopted him when I say I I Want to adopt a family do you get to know kind of what the family's needs or are these sort of\nYes when they apply for assistance there's actually a description of the family the family members their ages there genders and their wish lists ... so you could actually be more specific say I always adopt a child who loves a Spiderman\nFor the last four years I've dropped the adoptive families single father with a young boy he will Spiderman items so you you do get to know a little bit about them you can choose either delivered items to us\nAnd we will actually get the items to the family or you can deliver directly to the family\nIs that's the the choice of the the adopter\nSo this is almost like a supplemental to Santa is you know you're not getting the than help out the the big guy with the beer exactly and the ... or no and this is amazing I really do encourage folks I Know it's early in the year but with the reason we're talking this early this year because\nI Want people to take up that calling to adopt a family\nKind of get to know that family and kind of what their needs are and that allows you to do it on a really personal basis I mean some people like you know ... nothing wrong with that and ... also they were not insects away absolutely though I Will not turn them away but\nWhen you can realize exactly where the money is going or exactly were your gifts are going to uh it really personalize it and makes you realize here's who I Am actually help right\nWe've even had families adopt a famous Christmas and actually do it so early they can plan for Thanksgiving feast oh wow delivered the family as well OK kind of taking in everything to do with the holiday 'cause it all strings together ... says it all in all of a blur one\nBig holiday season and and again you're you're finding these families through it so toys for talks but also you mentioned different churches in the area they are essentially families that are in their congregation or families they meet during their outrage\nRight that families that they assess throughout the year that they know they're in need we provide applications we collect all the applications clear it through our database\nAnd make sure that they're not applying more than one place for it so that the most people are adopted and there's a duplication that some if one family tries to go here there and everywhere\nThen they're they're not allowed into the\nProgram I understand I understand well and we don't want people to slip through the cracks too so people aiming up together again voters you can go to a hands on river region doubt or all the information there you can look up the Christmas clearing house there's also all sorts of other things going on with hand on average about or all the time\nFor maybe for folks who are in a church right now maybe they're starting up a non profit they just haven't\nIt was really a one stop shop it's all nonprofits nonprofit by some folks out there like that they're kind of getting into the nonprofit sector and they haven't heard of hands on river region I mean they can get in contact with y'all to lately you know be part of your your team\nWere called the agency aged female we do is we help them to fill their mission we help them to collect the recruit volunteers to promote their activities and that sort of thing through our website through our um connection with our over four thousand five thousand volunteers register on our side\nWhen let's go from that aspect people if you are interested not necessarily and you have one thing in mind like maybe you want to do the Christmas clearing house and you want to adopt a family but maybe you're more like well I generally want to volunteer just don't know what yet you can register ride with hands on every lately\nIt's as easy as registering through your Facebook account okay uh a few details your name or email that's about all we need and you could actually go through and browse whenever whenever opportunities in any one day we have at least eighty\nDifferent projects or events going on throughout the river region not only my government can but also Elmore on ... lounge making ... while so yeah we cover five counties so you\nCan kinda just sign up say I'm willing to volunteer and hands on river region will send you an email at ... or something like\nThat you actually browse the different options are available and you sign up for that specific opportunity okay or you could if you just don't if you just want to be a register volunteer then you'll be getting you'll be receiving notice ... notifications from us this is going up to date on different things are going on exactly\nWonderful and really there's always room for help me for health absolutely this is what we do it's what help build a build a great community um people really looking out for one another I mean I've heard the old saying it takes a village but what does the village made up of you know kind of right\nThat's why we were established the United way did a study and recognize that community with a lot of volunteers in it are gonna is gonna be healthier community\nOf villages middle to upper those intrepid you know kind of entrepreneur is maples learning business but also people taking time out of their busy schedule to be a volunteer their time and talent exile will fill a tighter folks\nWere starting early this year but we really want to hit the ground running with is the Christmas clearing house you can donate money if you wish you can donate\nGeneral needs like whether it's toys specific things on wish list or as you said Neal cleaning supplies bad from ... or and this would really encourage you to do folks adopt the family that way you kind of get to know\nA family personally and his was just mentioned has to\nYou don't have to wait all the way to Christmas sure to be a Thanksgiving thing to ... early so again if folks are interested in any of these opportunities is of course was clearing house and volunteering maybe hook you up their nonprofit or their church with hands on river region how can they get into\nTo six for three three three five or hands on ever region dot org and I encourage folks I'm just an Internet guy maybe more needle thing ends on river region dot org rule Leslie Barker thank you so much for joining Kelly\nPeople never understand what it is unless they've gone there themselves to be violated in that way I mean whether they actually steal anything whether they are able to do that it doesn't matter is the fact that\nTheir home has been broken into and that is against them and that's the feeling that they have and so we help them to work through that to be able to talk it out and no we're not counselors but we can definitely listen\nSo I mean how do you what do you say to somebody though when is it really just a matter of listening and and being an ear to someone or I just don't know what I Would say to somebody who feels violated\n[noise] uh so many times a what we do is when we listen to them and and we know that they are in need of that help or of that list an ear we will just sit there and listen ah if they are warning to ah for us to talk with them and then of course we open up to them as well\nAnd just let them know you know are we are here for you and whatever help you need we are here to help you if it's something that we're not able to do we\nWill get you that resource to help but it's just a way of of keeping a calm a demeanor about us so that they can work through that stressful situation that they are through and and just know that somebody is there to help them out\nYou know if folks are hearing a speaking right now and is or want to say I would love to get involved with our own theory or\nOr for neighbors in Christ or maybe I can do one of the time but I have the money how can they get in touch with you and what sort of opportunities for people with\nAh first of all the all they've got to do is called our office at three three four two seven won three three one three and if we're not there then they can leave a message will get back with them we have an emergency number for those victims that are in need of help\nAh that is three three for three zero zero zero five five five\nAnd we have opportunities for people to work in the office to help us out with a paper work I'm just trying to I've got a lady now that it's been so faithful to come in and help me just get my office back together again where I don't have\nPeople who could help us with moving furniture I'm picking it up and taken it to people or as long as I've got to a valid driver's license and and it's looking good and then we need their help\nAnd those people that can repair doors and windows we need those as well so we just got a big line of of different areas that people can help us with it and isn't it\nAmazing that once you put on that mindset and put on those glasses of I'm going to help someone or just things matter I'm going to help turns into a man we need this we need that we need the ability to move all the supplies and we need this applies in the first place it seems um\nIt's a it's mind boggling once you really get your hands in the dirt so to speak on how much you can do\nThat's right that's right we are always had need\nOf a finding um to help us get through that as well because it does take money we don't charge these victims anything we are we are they are to help them hat and so it does take a funds to do that we appreciate every donation we get but we also appreciate those volunteers that help us\nAll Barbara I Want to thank you so much for stopping by today and talking to me and I'm next time let me know um when you all are having a special fund raiser a several months in advance so we can really get the word out and I would love to anyway thank you thank you\nA fellow music lover is here in Studio joining may just coming of the Montgomery area musicians association is also the\nVocalist plays a little bit of the blues Arthur harmonica for a king be Jeff how're you doing Lynn great Joe how are you brother a wonderful wonderful well I Want to start off his interview in a a unique way\nI've been thinking a lot about a single word freedom and often that word freedom is presented in a political sense you know somebody's fighting for this or that freedom this or that right\nNow I was thinking in a different car like what daily activity of what action you take it makes you feel free and ah fulfilled\nAnd so I wanted to put that question to you I suspect yeah I may know it but I'm also always willing to be surprised so how would you answer that question what sort of activity out their action you take in your life makes you feel the most free\nWell I'll tell you you know as as an artist a\nWe have a desire to create and in the creation of our whether it be visual or music or whatever the case may be um the freedom of expression through that are for music is what is the most fulfilling me personally um\nI couldn't imagine being in a situation uh where I could not do that I'll I'll I'll tell ya I'm\nAn experience of a story that was told me a couple of weeks ago or when we were up in Memphis [noise] there was a band or\nFrom the from the old self Soviet Union that was there if I Can't tell you what country that were from but uh they've since relocated to a South Florida are the ban is uh the David Smash bad you can look them up on line\nAnd you can hear the accent and in his vocals and he does blues and it's really cool but it's heavy and it's dark and he was telling telling a story there before one of the songs about his you'd written a song for his father\nWho was actually imprisoned in the old Soviet Union for playing music uh that was American style music which was the old old style blues whether you can you know grasp that or not but that was that was reality\nThe song let me tell you it was it was it was pretty moving to hear that\nWell you could say the blues and jazz jazz or particular so American as it is the sort of the music of freedom does Masha observers cultures or I Want to get back into your personal story when did you realize is that music was the way for you that this is what she wanted to do\nYou know it's uh it it\nProbably goes back to when I was just a child and I'm sure most people that are musicians they had an experience with our child but that that brought them towards the realization that music was going to be something that was going to be their future but\nUm I was born in ... Alabama and one when I was about five and a half years old uh my father decided he was gonna buy farm\nAnd move us out of the quote city if you will down to a to a farm in that farmers are just a just east of Fort deposit Alabama in the middle of nowhere this was I'm gonna date myself here it was Nineteen Seventy two\nSo we moved there in Seventy two and ... it was an old farms know farmhouse in the family that had been there have been there for many many many many years and I'm\nOn the farm there was an alternate house and there was a couple a African American couple that had lived in that house for many many years and so my father ... farm or the question arose well you know\nWhat what about these people that are living here and of course my my dad was like why you got to stay here as long as you want you know it's rent free whatever you want to do\nAnd uh the man's name was lying most Osborne but his his nickname was noon ... Osborne everybody called him and his wife was Lucille and when I was about seven years old I remember going up there to the to the little house that they lived in there on the on the\nOn the farm\nAnd a newly brought a guitar out it was an old kind of a beat up wouldn't guitar with rusty strings on it you know and and I'm not sure that our mother knew where I was telling the truth but er he brought it out in a sense they are on the steps that old\nRickety tenor house if you will\nAnd are pulled out a glass slide and ah which you in the blue style for those you know what a slide is you know what I'm Talking about but it's a\nIt's a you could make them out of class at a time or whatever and then he had made his out of a broken wind bottlenecks in his hand it off to the broken edge there and I was planning on starting to play the guitar\nAnd sliding glass bottle neck slot on the strings and and singing and uh his wife came out their Lucille came out sat down and sang low harmony with him and they were singing\nSinging spiritual songs things of that nature and uh and seven years old I didn't know what I was hearing but I knew when I was hearing was very special and it was it was probably I'm sure that it was the first time I've heard live music performed live\nAnd uh I didn't know if you know it was blue ... what John and it was I just knew that I never heard anything like it\nAnd uh that was the foundation uh that that I was I just sat there amazed you know it would watch for hours and hours\nAnd that went on throughout my childhood and I my grandmother bought me a guitar and I tried to tune at the same way and I tried to to to get a bottleneck you know and and had Mooney helped me make one for it and\nSomebody with a little a little bit more recognizable name you know like a abuzz group you know somebody that's people now and\nAnd uh I'd say a lot about it but it costs to all over me 'cause I I used to have that guy up you know I used to get him I used to play music with him and I I Would figure that he would know me well enough by the end and now that if we were going to invest our time is up and they ... it would be of of of a level of quality standards involved [noise] but I'm not really\nSure he even gave it much thought but uh when I got to hurt us all that and I told the guys I says I you know I I ran in the sky here's what he said he said you know they\n... is not not really taking a serious you know and they're looking for a bus group I said well if they're looking for bus ... how about a ... will just be the king be how 'bout that [laughter] so that's how we got our name but er [noise]\nWe've been we've been moving on and our horses and playing Venus and and um we we've evolved ah I went through several people in the rhythm section before we ended up with the with the the people that I really wanted to or after a thought what was the best fit which was every kid in ha a maestro Hebrew um\nAnd I hear recently uh we had an ... the author of a\nOf winning of local competition in Birmingham which was with the international blues a a challenge of the uh the blues foundation rather a Philly in Birmingham was the magic city blues society and uh\nWe won the magic city blues Saudis download the answer I got to represent Alabama in Memphis which is the international blues challenge\n[noise] ah there were there and fill each and every every state in the country in some states have more than one for example album actually has three Muscle Shoals one immobile at one in Birmingham, Alabama sent three baths and three solo duo acts so there's a I think\nUh every state the country and in a lot of countries Australia Germany um Italy ah UK ah Canada South America\nAnd or even Taiwan how to lose bad you know it's pretty cool um and so we went up there and ah there's a format this ... semifinals quarterfinals then finals\nAnd uh they come from a hundred and twenty six bands to forty four after the first two nights of semi final rounds where we effectively like two sets to twenty five minutes as a federal federal judges\nIn venues up and down below street every venue has to eleven bans in it and the federal panel of judges they're judging criteria\nAnd or even though I'm philosophically opposed competition in music because I think music is aren't ours expression is always in the eyes of the person on the receiving end of that to to figure out whether they dig it or not it's the means to an end and so we we we can formed and played in that format\nAnd we're like you'd have to make the first time from one twenty six to forty four and a I told my guys who said look pressure's off you know we had worked really hard part two years to get a CD done we had in hand when we were up there\nWere passing it out and they were going to have an opportunity because we made that cut to really have more of a concentrated audience um effectively everybody a that's anybody in the blues industry worldwide was there and if it's for those five days\nIt was their thirty third annual so they've they've got it pretty much down to a science and its\nPeople plan their years around those days are the uh to to be on Memphis and it's really a cool seeing but\nWe did that and I found that we made the cut and we played on friday night which was the semi final around and I mean these are all the winning bands and\nWe did our set and kind of went on about our way and said okay you know that was fun there's some other really good bands that here we're not going to get our hopes\nUp and and lo and behold later that night we found out we had made the cut again so we got down to the final uh eight\nAnd play with or fume theater on the on that Saturday in front of about three thousand or so people are and I would say probably a good solid third of those were industry people [noise] uh which was a huge opportunity for us and a a band out of Canada won first place\nAnd um I think we came in you know number three or four somewhere in there and to tell you the truth Joey I'm going I'm going to tell you this you know just keep it between me and\nYou know sure [laughter] we didn't plan on going that far you know we're all so when we did\nI got a little nervous because when I woke up that morning I said you know we we actually have a chance to witness thing 'cause we all want and they ... the worst case scenario going to play a but in the winter is the blues foundations\nWorld champion that writing on the poster child kind of a thing and they're guaranteed appearances that ... that you have to make and that requires taking about three to four weeks off to do a tour or they have these festival stacked up from Seattle to\nTo uh uh Montreal to the to the east coast and you know we still have day jobs so\nAh [laughter] when we weren't working band playing three hundred shows a year already you know we're all yeah so what do I tell my guys that day I didn't say anything to them I mean what am I going to say hey drag it up you know slowly we could've but are the good lord worked it out or we could not be more happy\nAnd we're just blessed uh forgot to coincide a with our CD release and uh to have been able to have gotten some international attention and put the spotlight on Montgomery a we we made it a point to let people know where\nMontgomery ah with with Nat King Cole half Williams junior big mama for in a in the list goes on and on of a of a musical prowess that has come from this area the birthplace of civil rights and that we had a story to tell\nAnd we try to tell that story in a hurry so music to to an extent as much as we can so we're just blessed by the whole thing I Know that was a long answer to short question but there you go\nOh no that's the answer one into one did you hear a little bit of that story and you know I find it fascinating especially for young people\nIs sometimes it's like I feel like a spinning my wheels or all here that from others yeah and whatever industry especially the arts or whether you're talking to graphic arts or in radio like this or especially music I can feel like\nAnd it's never going to break for us and you know you may never be as famous as some names we may know\nBut this was really like you said music\nYou weren't doing it for ... rock and all of a sudden you come back you put in the hard work and we all are finding this major success\nAre you hoping with developing this community here Montgomery will get more names like Hank Williams junior more names like not can cold that it won't be names from several decades paddle start to see new names and maybe ... to compete with Muscle Shoals a little bit in terms of legendary status of that is a quite a feat to uh take\nOh well the journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step Joey as we know that what you just said was really kind of the emphasis of the of the national id ah\nAh with\nEstablishing mama and what I and our vision statement it's effectively and I'm going to paraphrase it because I'm not reading it here but it's it's effectively to create opportunities to support local musicians\nAnd uh to work towards making Montgomery and the river raging region amusement destination\nAnd a lot there's a lot of talent in Montgomery that leaves the has to leave all\nThat there's this one right now on Julian McGuire I don't know if you've ever heard of Julian but if you are if you look up Justin Bieber he's been on tour with him for the last year and a half\nJulian actually went to my high school and and those number ...\n... Maguire uh Jillian Michael's just a fabulous guitars and you could catch him sitting in over their ten forty eight you know uh some nights and uh\nAnd it but there's just nothing to do here in Montgomery so he ended up leaving going to Atlanta and ultimately is is found success on the road a touring with the international or act\nUm I can give you a lot of other examples but instead of harping all that let let me talk about why we're trying to do what we're doing\nFirst of all if we can get musicians a platform start off with that gives them an opportunity to develop their their skills that also gives them an opportunity to other musicians are like minded and fans to to begin to build a support base or that starts in different uh in all different levels the first level\nIs to get musicians out to play in front of a live audience give them an opportunity to to do that or one of the ways that we do that which is a way that I was introduced a into that in into the\nThe beneficial aspects of playing in front of a live audience without actually being an established musician wants to participate and open jam sessions and these formats are are we will bring it to host band\nOr that will play an hour and and by the way we pay those bands were not asking them to come in for free that's another thing we tried to do is create a scale uh\nBut something to try and support these guys because it costs money to buy astronauts okay I mean people look at a harmonica they are that's just a little small that's what that's fifty bucks I've got two of them in my case in a different key spots of sharks for guitars and apps and everything else gas money you know\nI Try to trade with parents who really know I don't know for sure that their child is in the right car seat at the right age and five day for car dot com slash the right thing to make sure your child is protected route to you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council\n[noise] News I'm\nJeremy ...

S. underscores how vastly different the military's role is in each country it also suggests the challenge German politicians faced increasing defense expenditures to meet NATO spending guidelines a sharp point of contention between Berlin and the Trump Administration\nIn Germany shortfalls and military manpower have some political factions flirting with the idea of recruiting other European nationals into the German army\nI guess these will be mercenaries who are not typically reliable 'cause their loyalties for sale\nWhile nearly a third of Germans withhold their hero designation for all their fighters only five percent of those in America said no troops are heroes and twelve percent said they didn't know\nThe numbers demonstrated a tendency in the U.S military members on a pedestal a two thousand Seventeen Gallup poll found that Seventy two percent of Americans had confidence in our military the highest marks for any public institution\nHowever uh two thousand sixteen book edited by current defense secretary Jim Mattis and Kori Schake entitled warriors and citizens American views of our military found that few Americans we're very familiar with our military or how it functions under civil authority in Great Britain only six percent of those polled said soldiers\nPlayed a reserve high praise for troops are performed heroic acts with thirty two percent saying that demonstrated bravery should factor into the equation ...\nAmbivalence among Germans could be linked to their country's Nazi past and the eventual defeat in World War two twenty five percent of Germans and Eighteen and twenty nine years old said the troops were heros compared with just seven percent of people over sixty again according to you go\nIn the U.S women were more likely than men do consider any service member he wrote fifty seven percent compared to forty two percent for men who were more inclined to link heroism too in serving in combat roles\nSo what's a hero since few nations so they have a draft Israel is one exception all those sort of volunteers that means using our nation as an example all those in uniform have elected to place their lives on the line to defend our nation if needed\nThat his praise worthy of course many people joined the military for job training the GI Bill and other benefits but that doesn't take away from the fact they're willing to fight and die to protect the rest of us praise worthy yes but he rose\nI've been decorated for heroism several different times do I consider myself a hero well yes and no\nYou have all the heroes and why displayed in during my seven awards they do come close to what some of my friends where a medal of honor have done there is no question that a medal of honor recipients are heroes if they are heroes than there are no heroes\nAnd virtually every case when I've discussed brave acts with men who have done them in combat I've found that none felt that they were heroes\nAs I felt virtually all themselves and we just did what needed to be done [noise] yes it was dangerous but it needed doing and that's what we were there to do in some cases the challenges dealt with it a few minutes\nOthers took days so should we honor those who act bravely in or out of combat yes absolutely we should and our military has a number of metals to do that you just might want to learn what military medal stand for\nSo who is a hero I'll leave that up to you and those are my comments for today there's this girl going to get on you're listening to the frontlines of freedom now we get to enjoy some more wisdom with Chief Warrant officer ruined Ashby what do you have this week rolling\nThe army adopted the current battle rifle the M. sixteen over fifty five years ago [noise]\nThe last in the army went looking for new replacement for the M. sixteen was in two thousand two\nThey tested a high tech looking gun called the accent mate but after six years of testing the program was canceled as the army determine it offered few advantages over the current M. sixteen [noise] well the army may have found its next rifle in ...

then worry about is like their sense to be protective over women and that's just something that men are programmed to do is to be protective of women but\nPart of the culture right exactly but you got to let us do it you gotta let us prove that we can do it just so much because the outcome is all the saying we're still serving protecting our country were still\nShowing that men and women can do great things working together and you're talking about two half of the coin if you got the way they think and the way that women think and he put together something positive you have some or something

women leadership how did they act differently than males who are in a leadership role I had gory leaders that were women they saw one but they lead differently than males superiors but it's still worked\nAnd so I mean that says and account something to think about that a potential is there you just gotta give us a chance and be open minded to it\nYou know in the leadership role I completely agree because I have well she'll run march age we're on the very traditional male or was all basically all male army burn my service but I've interacted with email generals of all the services since

anybody\nThe first step it people need to take is to contact the mortgage lender and make sure their credit is in shape established their budget and then they start looking for the whole ways in their budget and just because they're qualified for\nTwo hundred thousand dollars it doesn't mean that they have to purchase a home for two hundred thousand dollars they can look below that price range so that they stay comfortable because when the largest lender kids and their top dollar amount they still have to take into consideration the utilities and the taxes and the insurance\nAnd I think that that where sometimes people get a little excited when they hear that they're qualified for a large amount\nThey start looking at pictures on line and they start to fall in love with the home that that the top of their budget and then they realize wow what a budget of two hundred thousand dollars or higher they still have everything else to pay for groceries to utilities\nThat puts a ruler in a

story I'll Try to sum it up as quickly as possible I purchased my home using a my BA homeland benefit back two thousand twelve\nAnd we went to refinance my home I say we me and my wife went to refinance my home because we knew we wanted a purchase again using our VA home loan benefit and every lender I talked to had no idea how to handle it how how to answer the question I ended up settling on the fact that I could not\nMultiple VA home loans I cannot reuse it by so right now I'm In a Fifteen year conventional fix Marge ... pm I which drives me insane when in fact the lender just didn't know what they were doing so that kind of propelled me down the road of becoming a VA homeland specialist\nAnd you are that now so let's talk about VA loans\nEverybody who serve generally speaking is entitled to a VA alone at some point or rather the biggest thing I've noticed we've agreed bizarre conversations\nMost veterans don't know what their rights are most of that or just don't know what they have\nSo it was a veteran out there we just talked to said the ... about if you buy a house how to talk to a real answer when you're considering a VA loan watch or some kind of loan what are the kinds of things you need to do what are the alert point sort of the things we need to be aware that we don't know\nI understand what you're saying the number one question at me as a veteran would ask a lender would be am I eligible because you'd be surprised at\nThe amount of lenders that cannot tell you give you the straight answer\nBecause it's not as easy as are you a veteran old therefore you are entitled to the VA how long it's not that simple especially here in West Michigan where we're surrounded by reserves centers so the reservists need to meet a specific year and points\nThat we do not have those years and point statements how can we determine if you're eligible\nTo that that would be the first question that I Would ask as a veteran to a lender am I eligible and can you tell me if I'm eligible\nAnd if they say yes I can tell you if you are there is a document it is the most important document dealing with the VA home loan that are highly advise you and suggest that you obtain this document it's your eligibility certificate your CEO eat\nThis is the document that will allow you as a veteran to go to any lender and say hey I Am eligible for the VA home loan who gives us to be a now there's three ways in which you can obtain a CEO ... the first way is through the ... benefits Web portal which if you are not on that\nActively I highly suggest you release check it out and it's a fantastic Web portal\nGets you there you can get it through a lender me as a lender I can pull it for you it takes me thirty seconds and that's no joke I type a three fingers so it type a little slower [laughter] but I can pull of Oregon thirty seconds or you can go through archives dot Gov\nOkay so you get it it's not a problem all you need to do is no you need to\nCorrect and the reason why I'm emphasizing this is because there's so many lenders out there that will blame\nThere is to obtain this eligibility document and if they cannot get it for you they obviously do not know how to do a VA on long\nSo that's a good indication to go somewhere else this girl going to give them an front lines of freedom are discussing VA mortgage was grad students to read tell us or them of the company you work with\nI work with the veterans home front at benchmark mortgage okay\nSo now I Know I'm eligible because I asked her I got by certificate what else do I need to know about a VA loan as a veteran assuming that I'm eligible for\nOkay there are many many many benefits to the VA home loan the most important one is that you've earned it\nThis is the best financing to on the planet you ever earned it do not let any lender tell you otherwise any agent you otherwise the benefits that are included in the VA home loans include no P. M. I. you pay no mortgage insurance on a monthly basis that saves you over a hundred dollars every month\nThere's lenient credit underwriting so if you had a prior VA foreclosure or if you've had a foreclosure filed bankruptcy or your credit is not to the standard that you think it should be you'd be shocked I was allowed with the VA home loan\nYou can have multiple VA home loans at a time and there are many many many more so pleased to all of us veterans service and do not listen to them is that are out there\nWe don't have a lot of time left but there are some miss out there why don't you tell us what some of them are\nThe miss that are out there that I come across on a daily basis are\nZero down equals week buyer because we have earned the right to do is zero downpayment loan they automatically assume that veterans are weak buyers a credit underwriting takes longer the VA home loans take longer to close\nMy personal favorite the seller has to pay for the veterans fees the other

who were trying to put away money for their retirement\nThat's right now a lot of people say well you know my retirement is going to get locked up I've got a a as a retirement program that little I did a little chastising a little earlier before the break a\nMedical workers are being done wrong in this city because they should be able to take money I Wonder if it demand and a half or even though they're still employed if anyone is listening to this is a management person you can change that all you gotta do sailing investment company to change that or get a you know what out ... and lives will be another one that will do it for you\nNow I Want to say right now I Know for a fact\nThat uh and you do too I'm sure in in the medical field right you know nurses or card they sure do now when they went on that TV show what was that the you\nKnow I just want to put my foot through the television talking about nurses didn't work hard and they or you know just a bunch of prima donnas now I Know that these are not been in the hospital is and I know you know nurse comes in their spends ten minutes for me I'm not one not only one on that floor and she's got to look after\nAnd you know I'm a ...\nThese people deserve the respect of course their male nurses to right there ... there and there weren't any they're taken care of folks and then not getting the appreciation and they they don't need this this problem that you just mentioned\nWell it's not just nurses you got to your laboratory people ... who who should have a lot more respect in you know they're they're kind of like the unknowns you got the X ray and the radiological paypal\nOr you've got to physical therapy people you've got all the you got all these different aspects you you've got the transportation people you've got the pharmacy\nYou know everybody works as a as a you know as a unit that drove the hospital\nOr machine right\nAh but the fact is when you when when I went on hospital\nPuts together a retirement plan and they get snow covered and I'm going to use the word snuck it by the investment or people who come\nInto a allowing a contract to sign that they can't take the money out when they're fifty nine and a half and maybe even though they're still employed ... is something wrong with it because a lot of people break down and they want to start working part time or they want to work\nOr somewhere else and keep that job a little bit you know but the fact that they if they work in just one day a month\nThat investment company says you can't have your money and you're like sixty five sixty six seven years oh almost and you can't get any money\nThen you have to quit your job so you get your money that's something wrong with that picture of you know a lot of people when they get to that in half they deserve they said well we're just doing it so that they cause they might spend their money I get that patriot but what if you're fifty nine and a half and you've got a quite a bit of money and then you want to take some of it out and put it\nWhere it's safer for example because maybe they don't have a safe mode that you could go into and then you're kind of stuck in a\nMode that you don't want to be and they need to put some more liquidity and these things so these four O. one K. is are getting that way ... the I'm\nEase and four fifty seven uh those those plans haven't gotten to where the four oh one case have got brought one K. is are still not where they need to be ... but the full ... have more protection mechanism\nA lot of them will allow you to take out a what they call a just to withdraw and usually they put in there like fifty nine and a half is usually the the primary age but they can put in their forty five\nThey could put thirty five mhm it's all in the plan documents okay\nIn the in the more liberal it is I see people all the time and trying to borrow their own money out of a for all three bay paying interest they're restricted they don't get their money okay some people would not say if I get I get the pitcher mhm but when you're fifty nine and a half and you can get your money\nI think he went too far with it way too far\nSo how can you tap\nYour retirement savings without getting hit with a penalty by the government that's\nAnother story but we're going to talk about a centrally uh that's called a Seventy two tea you say what is a Seventy two ... is it is kind of Seventy two T distribution oh are you know\nLet's say you did have a four O. one K. they would allow you to take some money out before you were fifty nine and a half okay and if you worry then you're you're dealing with a good company okay maybe you can be forty five\nSo you say look I'm going to continue to work\nBut I Need to get a hold of some of that money because I've got children to send the college I got this got that\nAnd ah maybe they set up a program for the for the new thing with Trump maybe they didn't and we're going to get more into that\nSo the Seventy two tea will let you take a distribution of payments\nOver a certain period of time I think it's five years do hope that\nAt a certain amount you can't turn it off you can but if you do then all of them out of the money gets the penalty okay so if you had a hundred thousand dollars maybe you could take out five thousand dollars or ten thousand whatever the number would be\n... [laughter] we knew that going in and yeah that's what I mean that's the worst news we've had to date as the gym for like as a gift like get updates on the NAFTA deal we get updates on Brett Kavanaugh what's going on in his life outside of judicial eating tomatoes that weren't ...

aside and had this guy be important in his points\nAnd when I suggested that all the Roy Moore the reporters freaked out on their egos too big and you know why they freaked out because they knew it

and they want to punish should penalize anybody that wants to say hey I'm willing to put myself in\nOur wife a public service and it's not necessarily about the person it's about the family can you imagine what those two kids and what that wife has been through the hill that they've been through that you can say the same thing on those that are accused of but\nThat's the reason it good people say why don't I Want to get into politics he feel like your family's been subjected to some of them are in the last election years very much so because they got very personal uh and my family got very very upset about it um\nWhat what did they say ... take me through some of the Congress it not not blow by blow nothing personal obviously but what what is sort of the tone in ten or the conversations around home when it's happening [noise]\nWhen you accuse ... case to us but the father\nOf some of the things that they accused me up it directly bears upon the family and some from that standpoint you know what are they going to be able to say say put your arms around you and say hey you know dad or or whatever of you know we know it's not true of many things that\nThe ...\nDoing business for a friend Tony and\nTaken this are taking that are putting this person\nAnd play just just the allegations that we don't care about human rights we don't care about the black people on the west that all we want to do is take care of the east side and our friends it's just not right\nBut those are the kinds of statements when you when you're in coming in my case when you're an income at all they can talk about is what's wrong with the city of Miami\nI'm a half full glass or cat a guy we are more right than we've got wrong\nAnd my ... does that mean we don't have issues that we have to deal with we certainly do some I can control and some of my gay so from that standpoint what politics ought to be about\nIs the art of compromise let's get around the table and try to figure out what we can do politics should be the art of the possible that the art of the negative [noise]\nThat was actually beautiful because [noise] I Know the the ... and ... and and working in politics jak and I sometimes have to do the things that hurt people like you you [laughter]\nI'm In developing campaigns do well like you know it was we tried to be honest about it when when you run into some of them was a record I think their records fair game now whether they had a bankruptcy or divorce than I'm going to do the yeah that's that's off the table I mean we ran against the guy\nEight to one who had three really messy divorces or\nHad been fired from a job we didn't bring any of that uh we beat the hell out of my income and Gore\nAnd and his ... votes for common Gore and we beat them\nWith like Seventy grand and he spent four or five hundred grand and had every Republican in the state door knocking forum and noting the bench for him and everything else and we want an issue totally unrelated to his personal failings I Would never even brought them up but unfortunately negative ads work\nAnd we could have we could have done negative ads and all that other stuff but we didn't\nSo what's your what's your take on a\nThat are not debating a ... by the tells me I shouldn't have debated you know three three years in a while\nIt is a huge huge debate was on the novel that Shakespeare yeah we like four or five I wouldn't call them debates there was just too and I kind of kind of stuff you know hold on\nCan I can I ask you one of my favorite moments in political history happened at Shakespeare festival when you guys Ron debating\nA ... day whatever her name was you know what I'm Talking about here yelling at night as the only thing I remember she came out this is like two weeks for the election and they asked or do you have a plan to address inequality Montgomery whatever she goes I have a plan it is a seven step plan\nBut I'm not ready to tell you guys get what's in it [laughter] and I looked to my left or right about the elections when he gets around to get into it seems like it'd be a critical moment to uh go ahead you're has it had like an eight point\nPlaying but they're only six of them I don't know how anybody just savaged him for it I Can't remember who it was ... ...\nWell see if we had political 'cause it's like you guys politics wouldn't be the art of many blood sucker folly cakes now many but soccer so down about it a long way it's kind of thing I get a few calls now I'm\nTo inquire as to you know what's it like to be the mayor oh we need is somebody that doesn't want to position but most of the job\nGen Campbell for the right reasons yeah a real quickly then went back to the phones enough people want to get down to seven to nine two to eight well you're going to do are you going to really retire I mean the guy that's worked as hard as you have for as long as you have to retire\nBut honestly still looked like six years old when three years at a you know there's no way that you just retire and you know go away ah ah\nAh somebody asked me that this morning on a call in a TV show and\nAh my my standard answer is I Want to be a better husband ... grandfather and I already knew me that because you know all my work life particularly the formative years I was with Don or an international company\nAnd I was all over this world for so many so many years and then you know when you're in the car business a that's a hands on be there a type scenario I so I have missed some of my growing up and I'd like to a\nCase they do do that with uh maybe some of my grandkids [noise] um\nI Am ... I Want to do more there are we've got some educational issues here that I Want to be part of particularly the positive things uh maybe I'll teach it a little bit maybe we'll teach a little bit of course the two government or\nOr a bad thing or something like that uh and then there'll be some volunteer work and that we could do that place or south of here that we'd like to spend a bit more time\nBack to conclude over there on a Saturday morning and basically help them move\nMass trying to find homes for them right now they don't want to be in home now that would be much stronger now I Know that I don't know how much can we put some sort of mosquito nets done that way on them out not only that we went way when we go we spent like buckets of water and got some we've got some game

twenty four years I think he did a bang up job actually improvements all the time but uh it wasn't until just recently that I had occasion to attend several a city council meetings and my eyes were really opened\nAnd kudos to you for the uh the great class and race you show in taking the abuse to receive especially at the end of those meetings\nYou and your councilman general I get called every name in the ... yeah\nAnd it's a shame you handle it\nPrivate land for one of those things and I wanted to be sure and just uh say that publicly\nWell appreciate it comes to enjoy but if we get more people like you come and they had crowd\nOut all the rest so people comment we we love that but uh yeah it is the time for those students that want to come and voice their concerns unfortunately some of the issues they talk about our\nIs just factually incorrect of are different than a but a ... right and uh they get three minutes to do that but I appreciate your comment um they're they're very helpful but goes sometimes it is very difficult just to keep your mouth shut\nI'm getting a text from a big wig [noise] how big the big wigs pretty big [noise] telling me that they may be something a

think he's not afraid\nOr you can um will will ride by they we got to go back into town ah I'm\nMy first instinct would be that perhaps\nThey have nothing has been done on private property but we were kicked that and make sure if it's ... probably get it done of his own ... ups and that's what I was thinking the ASU property but but it's not that I refer to as soon as they issue but we go back\nAnd check then if it is will notify them just I Would do everybody has cut the grass that behind and we find a\nState agency or state entity like that you could find them but they'll never have rights or you know not only the board and when we put the people that we've noticed and we've gone out and debate and things like that state of Alabama will be a a pretty prevalent name up there because I have

I don't believe it's been ... yet that is uh [noise] that is a\nStill out there still out there will get back to that when they do say that 'cause there's a lot to talk about on that I mentioned the NAFTA loophole to got closed during the discussion with the mayor if you weren't here during the ten o'clock hour if you ever want to know\nWhy it was so critical Donald Trump had to be elected president United States beginning in the late Nineteen eighties and continuing until twenty sixteen early early twenty seven thing with Donald Trump took over [noise]\nAmerica was absolutely getting rated [noise] getting rated the for the last rate on American soil Santa Ana last foreign rain on American soil as Santa Ana back in the early Nineteen hundreds [noise]\nThe the the last domestic raid on America was NAFTA\nWas NAFTA and terrible trade deals by people like George H W. Bush George W. Bush Bill Clinton and Barack Obama for the worst presidents to ever occupy the White House\nJust terrible terrible human beings generally are and and worst presidents\nDonald Trump got in there and it's completely rework the trade deal with the United states Mexico and Canada NAFTA is dead\nNAFTA is dead I told you a year year and a half ago that was Donald Trump's number one priority was getting NAFTA reworked it is now done it took less than two years an apt to deal that took probably ten years to put together [noise]\nTook him less than two years it completely tear it down and create a deal that's going to help the American worker or one of them the biggest deal say here are the biggest problem with NAFTA\nHere is the biggest problem with NAFTA United States and Mexico and Canada agreed to basically free trade across borders except in a couple of industries Canada wanted to protect their dairy industry\nThey didn't want American dairy coming across they didn't want American telecom company coming across they didn't want American banks coming across they push hugely protectionist measures on those three industries in particular other industries as well but those three in particular [noise]\nOther than that it was basically come as you are you know your trucks can come across you can truck in the United states same thing with Mexico you can bring your goods and you can take your goods out that's fine and in theory\nThat is\nA decent way to do business with your neighbors goes and goes out the problem is\nThat the United states was getting raped I mean absolutely raped and pillaged by countries like China and and other Southeast Asian countries in particular but countries up and down the Central American court or in the south America\nBy\nAnd Canada allowing people to dump their goods in Canada and in Mexico do wanna little final touch to maybe\nAnd then across the border duty free\nAnd they were allowing it to do to do it on things like our commodities industries food metals\nStaples things that we need in order to produce a great military a great citizenry happy healthy fats citizenry trust me we succeeded [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nBut what they would do is they would they would use Mexico as a staging primarily Mexico the candidate would do it too they would use them as a staging ground [noise] we would have to deal with Canada anything made in Canada could come across duty free and so Canada would\nEr tariff free or low low super low tear Canada would allow in Mexico would allow goods to be mostly assembled overseas shipped over to Mexico\nAnd if you would have paid on a billion dollars worth of products two hundred million dollars in tariffs to do business with the United states and Mexico can then take a hundred million from you and ship it across the border for free\nAnd you just said as a as a producer a hundred million dollars on a billion dollars worth of goods basically ten percent you're basically cut your tears and a half and the reality was they were taken leaner and leaner cuts\nAnd the result was\nThe American manufacturing industry was just totally annihilated and destroyed the farming industry to some extent totally annihilated industrial [noise]\n\nThe reality\nAnd that is what Donald Trump wanted to correct because he knew that the average American worker was just getting way laid by these policies as to what they've done is they've restructure key parts of the trade agreement\n[laughter] and they understand that Mexico and Canada have a unique access to the U.S market because of this trade agreement\nAs to what Donald Trump did was he closed the big NAFTA loophole [noise]\nIn order for China or any other Asian country in order for Central American or South American country to get goods into the United states now through Mexico and Canada\nThe United states will now have a veto over any trade agreements between Canada and the rest of the world and between Mexico and the rest of the world or any individual country\nThey can come up with a trade agreement that they have to submit it to the United states in the United states to veto it or it gets to the proven now here's where the metal ... where are the rubber meets the road here's where we get a test the metal\n\nDonald Trump will not be part of the United states for the forever\nAt some point he has to go\nConstitution limits into three the two terms rather I Wish we could get that revoked\nThe constitutional limits into two terms [noise]\nAt some point a Democrat or global lists\nAre established that Republican or global is what I repeat myself there's no difference among any of them will become friends the United states and have control over the trade agreements and one day the president will either the future global as president who either realize the good\nThat this is doing\nAnd keep the agreements in place because he or she wants the United states to be ... great global power here see once the United states citizens to be nice and wealthy to have access\nTo the finer amenities in life\nWell from generation to generation to be charitable the friends family and the less fortunate\nThat President will do what the last four terrible loser presidents have done George W. Bush Bill Clinton George W. Bush and Barack Obama which is totally got the American people again\nDonald Trump has given us a reprieve Donald Trump has given us a chance to keep wealth in the United states for at least the next six years while he's president nice to\nAt least six years Donald Trump has given us that opportunity\nWe will need to keep watchful eyes a watchful eye\nOn the next president of the United states be at my parents or anyone else\nAnd if you get one of these global listed in there\n\nIf you get one of these Democrats and their kids to understand that they don't like you they don't want you to be wealthy they don't want you to have access to a finer life and well that you can pass on\n[noise] they want you to be poor and dependent on government\nAnd they want their donors who make money off of actual trading your wealth out of the United states in other countries they want their donors will be very happy that Donald Trump right now is making a very said God which is why they're going after him so much tickets have passed eleven o'clock can't believe it\nIs that with the program about two hundred friends who recalled plumbing to seven nine eighty nine Nineteen to seven eight nine one nine\nI think your phone calls after this to seven to nine to two as well get ready to buy a complement to set an eighty nine Nineteen to seven eight nine one nine the industry leaders in the blooming business in Montgomery and had been that way for forty plus years\nYou've seen the trucks rolling around as they make problem in great again because they get it like it a ... a compliment gets [noise]\nGive cold forming a call today to seven eighty nine Nineteen if you want to work well if you're in Donald Trump's America and you were the worst [noise] your mantra plumber dream and Plummer goodbye let him only to causing billboards on scope plumbing but usually hiring don't count\nAnd they'll ah they'll be glad to see you walk through the door all\nThe number one and the number to business and it can but when you're in trouble with him on he called on call\nA ... year old daughter Fatima are\nAll around the way I'm going to make me [noise]\nYou're going to be our side radio hour Monday through friday six or seven feet on the news all the money going what do you have any [noise]\nNo they'll construct rains continue to go up even even though a fair I'm from Mexico but ... now ... never ever went down because the map\nSo why did why why why out sourcing to Mexico why why not make them here is the price goes up\nAll my costs went down but it could have caused a concert or continue to go on I mean my costs went up to\nBut we\nAll of a strong grown in Mexico messy and it it comes to ruin this climate and um it's a very labor intensive\nA past that takes forty miles to learn how to make a a low in Britain attacked here to learn how to make a commercial ... so is that is gone I mean they they look at it\nEven bring their leg if you had to\nI couldn't bring it back to tear went back to thirty two percent or watch or a hundred years\nSo we went from thirty to present a zero percent right yes yeah and it but it's phased out\nIt was supposed to pay out over Fifteen Years from thirty two percent to zero percent but within two years the Mexicans just started trading\nIt was ... and it was it was Arctic gone because customs but not enforced that they didn't have and frankly we would enforce that ... that we don't have a bonding or the manpower the on ...

get his hands around now nobody\nBut he's income is as high as it was not not in a category of people is as high as it was when NAFTA went enforced\nAnd cause a product or not why\nNo they're not but the quality is less\nAnd and the and the promises of NAFTA is free trade didn't materialized because it wasn't free trade it all we were sold a bill of goods that they were all these free trade agreements we were in an ending to even put it in the title North American free trade agreement wasn't free and all it was a nine hundred and fifty percent tariff on American dairy products going into Canada has that free\nThere was not a nine hundred and fifty percent tariff on Canadian there in front of him back in the United states\nAnd there was a ten percent terror of going into Europe as a twenty five or twenty five percent for our good to go to Europe attempts that they're coming back over here and said free we couldn't sell cars in Europe all their cars still over here\nWhen they look

doing at Halloween and talk about are moving [noise]\nI Know if I'm bugging people talking about horror movies also talking about bad movies in November because their turkeys I'll start talking about Christmas movies at Christmas Time and then I'll be of course talking about a war movies the beginning of the year so I have different things that happened\nThroughout the year so it's not always going to be horror movies but I Love to just dive in at Halloween time\nAnd some people do I like to watch a horror movie a day around Halloween and a lot of times it's old standbys like I watch the other night I watched the invasion of the body Snatchers from Nineteen Seventy eight with my son who's Ken who never seen it before and I lost sleep over that movie when I was ten I think he handled it a little differently than I did but he kind of get sucked in it was funny watching um he\nHe was into that movie that is a great movie it's one of my favorite of all times and and it's the best version of it I think I Love the original with Kevin McCarthy but the one in Nineteen Seventy eight with Donald Sutherland Brooke Adams is so visceral and pragmatic and realistic and and and the tops\nAnd with Gabrielle Anwar and they did a remake in two thousand seven I think with Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig that one's kind of a mess Nineteen Seventy eight to really good one but the other thing I Do with my kids\nEvery year and this goes back to me when I was in high school there was a theater in town called the Drexel north and it was just being a hundred feet theater that is now a fitness center\nWhich is sad in its own right but it was this big eight hundred and the theater and they do twenty four hour marathons where they show\nTwelve or Thirteen horror movies all night long and they'd have trailers and cartoons and a short films and little bits and theater bumpers that that always made it very special that experience now I was in high school in the eighties so that was your only option to see some of these movies yeah should VHS\nBut you're also looking at on a Nineteen inch TV in your parents' basement and you weren't watching them on the big screen so I Would go to these only movie marathons and I loved it there was a huge deal for me in the late eighties and early nineties\nNow they still do them because of scheduling and some other things happened in my life I'm not able to go to them all the time\nBut it's a little easier to do them at home you know because we have better TVs and we have Blu ray and and and what I also do is I I Do a mini marathon now every year for my family\nOf horror movies they used to be twenty four hours but I just don't have the strength for that anymore I Do like a twelve or Thirteen hour fourteen hour marathon\nAnd you know I had like my dad come over and my kids were there and my wife was doing concessions and I put together trailer blocks and are we watch cartoons like looney tunes and so it was a lot of fun and I make it as much like a theatrical experience as possible\nThis year to the movies that we watched I wanted to review on this show and I might drop a couple of later on because they're classics and one of the things that I've done as a parent and a movie lover is I have\nMade a point to expose my kids not just to the movies that are out there in the theaters right now those are great you know I Love taking my kids are the marvel movies and the star wars movies and all that good stuff\nBut I also like them to see over film and I'm not just talking about ... eighty stuff that I saw when I was a kid or like I mentioned I watched the Beijing the body Snatchers Nineteen Seventy eight version with my son the other day those or something I saw I was a kid but even older ones I like to during these marathons I pick stuff out of the\nDifferent areas I I like showing them the old monster movies from the forties I think it's it's worth something cinematic lead to expose children to the black and white movies the movies that were made long before digital technologies long before any sort of modern filmmaking techniques stuff that was\nMade long before I was even a line\nLike the wolf men and Frankenstein and Dracula those are worse than showing in and not just in the ... hours on raw I mean it's worth showing them stuff like Citizen Kane and classic movies because not everything has happened in your lifetime and you need to have a sense of history not just for history\nOf the history of the world in the country and the people but of cinema\nOne of them that we did this weekend was return of the vampire\nBela Lugosi starts as a vampire who writes us from London grave during the bombing of World War two\nVince is considered sort of an on official sequel to Dracula it was made by Columbia Pictures universal course to Dracula\nAnother Dracula movie and then they will those the only play Dracula twice in his entire lifetime he played him in Dracula and then he played him in ... Frankenstein he played vampires though like you said it's an unofficial sequel to Dracula ... daughter and then some Dracula revoke their and while Bela Lugosi showed up and all these other\nUniverses a horror movies like the wolf man he played bailout the gypsy and he played ego or the Frankenstein meets a little fan or a ghost Frankenstein he played various characters but this is a fun little it's very much cut from the same cloth of Dracula only it's you know about I think twelve years later was when they made it\nIt's classic Lugosi it's got the classic elements to the graveyards the bats you've got a wearable friend there who talks plain English which is kind of silly but they they have all these elements and you have the ... the police detective who who doesn't believe any of it\nMisses a fun movie it's words tracking down especially if you have shown\nA younger generation the original Dracula and taught them to appreciate watching a black and white movie that's not going to be seen them special effects and action from an ad and enjoy the atmosphere now this isn't as atmosphere\nAs the Nineteen thirty one version the Nineteen thirty one direction was very atmosphere and the set design as a result built for the academy frame and it's\nVery intricate and intense this one's a little more mainstream for the time this was around the time they were making the man and Frank and find middle man as opposed to just coming out of the silent era Nineteen thirty one when the original ... but still this is worth checking out it was sort of a lost favor with little goes the return of the vampire\nRocks rocks and\nYou're listening to fact guys at the movies or Kevin car I just have a couple of minutes talk really quickly about the fun house and that's all I really need drinks my told me Hooper may Nineteen eighty one group of teenagers go to a carnival and hide overnight and the fun house only to be struck by a mutant killer\nThing alive [noise] something not alive like his father something better do something that has the form of a human being that the flash\nOn this [noise]\nThis is very similar to how fast which is out right now is this was just a slasher is not a particularly good slasher and has some great imagery to it and it has a great box covered had always had a great VHS box cover\nBut in essence it's it's a bunch of teens going into a bad situation and being struck by killer not much more takes a long time to get to the\nThe the slasher part of the slasher and other than that the characters aren't terribly memorable they're not terribly well developed this is exactly the kind of movie that came out in the early eighties that was\nTrying to play off of all the success of friday the thirteenth and Halloween movies so it's sort of one of those things I have never seen I wanted to see\nBut I have to say it it didn't really grabbed me as a horror movie even as a retro horror movies company love the eighties and grow up in the eighties this one really is somewhat forget I'm also I'm going to have to say the fun house kind of sucks it can track\nWay to an end and I do like to know that that's a segment when it come back I'm going to be talking about the new movies in theaters a star is born and the better\nIndividuals and businesses with tax problems\nYou over ten thousand dollars in back taxes or have an file tax

Rises or dung Kirk he does find in the movie in fact I think he elevates the movie way more than it really should be\nThe story is really I mean\nIt's got the billionaire trying to colonize other planets it's got this weird environmental message but this anti you know billionaire message ... and only the it's got like thing happening you hear the story construction moments where you're like well I don't even understand\nHow that pragmatically happens you know they're stealing homeless people in running experiments on them and then making them disappear but somehow they're stealing them and having them signed waivers but then they just dump them in a landfill to get rid of it it's the strangest\nSet up of a movie that I've seen that that takes so much time to explain\nThe new ones

performance and that one I thought she was a fantastic performance of Manchester by the seat\nOf the ones that she gets a lot of accolades for stuff like my week with marijuana might that one was dumb I didn't like her and that so she kind of blows hot and cold boy she pulls really cold on this one she is terrible in this movie the other thing with the movie it's it's it's very ... even if it's if

Nelson you got bill Corbett who played brain guy in crowds and\nThen of course Kevin Murphy who's been there forever playing Tom Service\nAnd they rent the movie they do a commentary tracking it and it can make terrible movies kind of funny the other reason I think this is because it's cars somebody from one of the worst movies ever made grace the Darrow who's known for being in the room\nAnd he of course wrote the book the disaster artist which would you made a new movie last year with James Franco\nWhich was one of my favorite movies of the year so I thought it was interesting to to sort of see this this bizarre piece of cinema history from the direct to video shops and retro puppet master the rooms breaks the sterile stars of the young Audrey tool on a French puppeteer who creates a group of disturbing pop up that are brought to light\n\n\n\nTimes though he be\nI'll be honest when I first picked this I thought it was just a renamed the version of the original puppet master it was to be the puppet master series is from full moon and I always had a lot of respect for full moon they weren't directed video series Charles Band had been making movies in the eighties leader he was actually involved and stuff\nAnd dogs and cruel then eventually he developed the full moon brand which was the big in the late eighties and through the nineties which was a direct a video company they just released everything on VHS nothing ever got a theatrical\nRelease I mean like dolls originally did his first earlier films but when he was doing the full moon stuff\nThey were stuff that he just crank out and there was a certain amount of kids to a man did these things called southern species which had a ... from Romania and and he did the puppet master which were these dolls that came to life and of course you to do all man which that started in Congress than\nAs a cop who who would gotten from going down in size that they did a lot of these movies and they were only shot and Romania and there were super on the cheap but they were actually kinda fun when they got to about the fifth or sixth installment of the franchise they're really kind of circling the drain\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center visit W.

truth of the matter is in the fall you obviously people come to your house and the holidays calm and everybody's there so\nJust uh just a few little designed tips and fix the kind of brought with me here one of them being the lighting now as an interior designer\nI tell my clients your lighting is oh you're in design is only as good as your lighting so you can have the most beautifully designed space but if you're landing on the entire state yeah so\nAcross is here with me today and they actually make it easy for you because they have what's called their color plus collection and what that means there was a hundred on trying designer\nNew to them and they're also a family owned company and they have been for forty years which is huge and that's why I loved them so much now regardless of what color you choose for your lamb ... holders it works great about them is it all their products are hand crafted and can certainly be customized to fit any space and you can find them all\nOn lab supply dot com so in terms of first\nConsider your lighting first because they truly do believe it's really what changes the way you're ...\nI Want to ask for sort of a regional adaptation of that in case it applies I Know that we're we're looking at darker days and what he is particularly important as we move for the autumn and move into winter I grew up in California\nAnd then move to the Pacific northwest I Know the lighting especially natural light is very important on those cloudy rainy days sometimes you want to be a sunny day for a long time there are there any particular tips would you have for those of us who are living a part of the country that isn't to say is that some use Arizona and Florida\nYeah well and I always suggest having us several light sources in every room so um I even told us earlier that in my bathroom\nI have over ... and then I have a little lamp on my on my counter top so I Love multiple lights versus because I feel like what they do is uh they dry around the room if you put them all over the room but it also breaks it up a little bit instead of having the overhead light\nYou know for us at a table lamp says well a mix and match maybe you don't want to be so I'm outwardly with your caller on your walls but then maybe you want to add some color in your Lance or things like that that's why these labs plus lighting a elements are so great

fueled adventure among the obsessive Somali aged\nBig bottle hunter he's an rogue scientists who taught me to live for taste Bianca welcome to Nelson as thank you so much for being here\nThank you so much for having me\nSo before you begin this journey you were an editor at the Huffington Post at what point did you see yourself to give this up and I'm going to drink water all day\nSo I have to qualify that by saying that as you alluded to I was really a wine group when that started like there are people who spend their weekends agonizing over the choice between lines from burgundy and boy do I would spend my weekends agonizing over the choice between winds from a bottle and a box\nAnd mine wind up his any uh did not happen the way it happened for most people which is you know drinking very expensive wine and a beautiful part of the world it happened at a computer screen and\nUh I happened to the governor or something called the ... world competition which is essentially the Westminster dog show with\nOnly got ... I had the same ... same cool announcer to announce the different varieties [laughter]\nHave you know did very well groomed specimens walking in a circle very high stress I mean they um [noise]\nYou know these ... hired that lady you know to a ballet dancer and ballet classes learn to walk on gracefully across the floor of the ... psychologist to help them stay cool under pressure voice coaches to help them modulate their voices into pleasing baritone third guest\nAnd I've always been obsessed with obsession and I\nGot hooked on you know why why what was the big deal about it and also you know for beverage of pleasure why do people put themselves through what seemed like a shocking amount of pain and then you know going back to this\nMentioned that the tech connection at that point I was living my life at the opposite extreme and it was a more personal concern which is what these people could stick their nose into a glass of wine and the taste and smell told them stories and [noise]\nI got hooked on this question of what was I missing you know can I hold my sense is the way they did what would change if I did and\nI got so consumed by that question I ended up quitting my job and starting over at the lowest of the low in the wind relatively seller rats and starting to train as a somewhere [noise]\nWow so so it really did suck you in the obsession with obsession became an obsession in other words exactly [laughter] you know I've always struggled with the question of um like I go back to the old joke what's the difference between a five dollar\nIt's always um [laughter] but you but you guys train and you you Phoebe specific things like when you talk about you know they're being under tones of almonds in the hands of a truck which you know whenever I drink wine you know I'm just saying\nI got to be making this up I don't get any of this stuff going on there\nI have to say that when\nI started this I was also very curious to know what is the U.S\nAnd I will say that when you clear away the ... you were left with these precious truth that have lessons way beyond a glass of wine on but I was really conscious and it's turning of wanting to go beyond the poetry and the romance and to pull back the curtain on parts of the wine role that\nI really never been explored I'm a high end the low end and the solar wind the science of it and quality was one of these very interesting questions you know I um worked in a\nDidn't apprenticeship at this Michelin star restaurant here in New York at a place called you know stretch of Manhattan notice billionaires row but I don't get that\nFine line experience and again I Want to go beyond that is not about\nFancy people drinking fancy winds and fancy places and so to answer this quality question I ended up going to\nThe epicenter of math market wind to see how the wind and most of us drink most of the time has made and the answer is it's not so much meat as it is engineered you know thinking about the flavor scientists who was designed new Swedish Fish Oreo flavors or\nTo read a chapter whatever and wind and very similar I mean you you know they had the sensory scientists they bring in consumer panels and you know do focus groups and if people decide that they want something with a little more purple color a little more raspberry you can make that happen there was about sixty two different additive\nThat can go into a bottle of wine to massage it's flavors I Do think that most of us realize that and that can be a different you know those go into the\nTen dollar bottle um where you have to sort of use these things to cover up a multitude of sins that they can also go into some you know hundred and fifty dollar bills [laughter]\nUm so I think that that for me was a real the revelation and I think that a lot of people don't know that we think of wine as being great niece and a little love but it's way more interesting and way more complex\nBut that that is fascinating to me we're speaking with a good ... the author of ... don't you know I'm I'm getting visions all of a sudden of of Eric ... offers a fast food nation was a different additives and so what do they put in our one\nSo you can you know up the city with ...\nAnd you can lower it again with calcium carbonate you can add the liquid out tenants of ships playing so they can at him\nAnd called mega purple which has been described as a magical potion by the wind industry\nUm but I think that there's you know it's funny there's I I wrote actually out of New York times op ed is actually calling shedding light on the way that these wines are made but also arguing that you know these are the wind that are most wine connoisseurs would dismisses bad\nAnd essentially saying look in my opinion I think that there's a place for them\nOne final question the one that my wife and I preferred if it's made from organic grapes it costs five bucks come from a breeder Joe's will we became Gaza side but it is it is actually is less about three bucks Chuck\nWhat was sort of the organic version of usually two buck Chuck but this is actually typically where we by about four fifty\nAnd it's made from organic rates ... far exceeds and we're not wine connoisseurs by any stretch of the imagination but it it's it's the best thing that we've ever come across you know for you even compared to things that are free tied for price so I just want to know are we going to\nSome parts of his I if I'm not I think that well I tell you know I ended up working has its own life as a guy who is a total mad genius pirates captain\nAnd retirement we didn't have already been within that you are\n[laughter] metaphorically calm and he had this great motto which was never drank the same wind twice\nAs mining by you know and they found the wind that you love me because you know a good ... good wine store um you really just need to get them to pieces of information in order to get a bottle the evil like what are you in bed and what flavor again like I Would suggest the next time you go in\nJust saying here's what I Want to bend and I like the taste of my you know organic grain to Ninety nine whatever and that can be the beginning to a new experience new flavor and a new discovery\nOr give them the budget for ... and we should be okay we've been speaking with me on a bus she's the author court dark wind

that time owned it is it still there and they were all these gleaming yellow appliances and\nAnd stainless steels sinks and it was all very very American they will [noise]\nAnd they had me and my

investigating I'm pretty sure the judge is getting the best way to do maybe I'm wrong I don't I investigated\nThis guy three times they found nothing this is just utter nonsense obstructionist nonsense from the same old crowd the same pack of liars and I want to see\nThem stood up to\nIt's just ridiculous when does that not a you know at what point do we say take some great with what's

boy but it's a natural there's nothing fake about it um\nI've seen lots of preachers on TV to look shifted to me like it was all about money [noise] they just seems like a guy who's been a straight arrow his whole life [noise] the embryos investigated him three times and then other\nDoctors comes a woman with a charge that dates back to Nineteen eighty two [noise] and once the FBI to investigate it now they want to Marilyn said attorney what's your take on this what what are you observing what you are very experienced with people and people who do and do not tell the truth [noise]\nUm [noise]\nAny person probably could have seen this coming a couple of weeks ago you know it at this point any male\nWho is in ... and you know for for anything at this point it's going to have one of those come out of the wood works at ... at this point whether he'd been charged boy weather have whether he is not whether he you know\nAnd that at Santa and whether he didn't and it doesn't matter at this point who you are you're going to have some somebody like that come out of the woodwork if if you're put up on a national platform and if you're if you're a man and this is what it is at this\nPoint actually if you're conservative yeah and she says ... for the Democratic party his former wife charged\nWith abuse of a very recent nature in fact there's now posted a doctor's note on line tobacco per assertion that she was abused in this marriage and the DNC doesn't seem the least bit interested in this man advance into the position of attorney general in Minnesota\nBut yeah I mean I I don't think that you can you know\nMake a judgment that she's a line but she's got some real credibility as she said the plane as they did I just think that the timing is just\nAnd I'm saying this guy [noise]\nTried to rape me and made me feel like he was going to kill me at a party in Nineteen eighty two what kind of questions would you want to ask [noise]\nWhy did you wait thirty plus here in one way that we went all out a lot of weight and yeah you know why now [noise]\nOn one and she did at from what I think she did make some like a couple of disclosure interesting thousand foreigners yeah she made a disclosure that\nIt was very much like house of cards she made a disclosure to account for her to a therapist at a high profile male and Washington made in you know inappropriate sexual advances at her when she was in high school or something to that nature but she didn't tell anybody until it was on the short list [noise]\nLike until his name was actually named on on President Trump's short length of him he would appoint that's what I think she first told her husband\nIs about that with him\nBut uh yeah she didn't tell anybody for for quite some time [noise]\nIt also happens to be politically a very left wing [noise] him as I said at the beginning of the show in my opinion I think that's the Supreme Court is what most of the people on the left their their legislative branch when people in there\nAnd it makes its way to the Supreme Court because the constitution as a living breathing document that must adjust to the time\nWe which is like\nAccurate I mean I think that we're ... everybody needs a historian like how the American government actually went designed to work um and how we are using it as not ... was intended and I think that we've really lost track of\nChecks and balances and who's supposed to do what when and and who actually had the legislative authority and his forces law and make from on your correction losing sight of that and we're going on in these wait times about what somebody may have done\nThirty years ago I think it's just ridiculous\nYou used the word witch hunt I think the uh the constitutional crisis facing President Trump right now it's clear to me that the deep state [noise]\nProbably all the way right up to ... Iraq Hussein Obama tried to undermine or overthrow the results of an election was a hoax ... book is very very compelling\nI've got a PDF that I've read it this guy is good [noise]\nUm [noise] and now the president has ordered the de classification of these documents these phony Feisal warrants and all the people that signed on to them including his own deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein\nAnd it's in the constitution has the authority they're under his jurisdiction ultimately\nThey must comply or they are guilty of support nation and can be fired\nAt this point once you got to lose by firing Rod Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions for that matter because I'm beginning to believe less and less that Jeff Sessions is not a deep state or\nAlready you know I just find that wouldn't matter as President Trump care cancer like people would still be unhappy with legitimate thing of all the clinics they'd put under the\nBusiness that I mean they just ... it it doesn't matter at this point it's it's I think than than than against us and nobody's ever going to be satisfied at this point 'cause that's what our\nSociety has turned into [noise] and that's not that's not what the Republican and Democratic Party weren't designed to do but people think it's ethical and see you argue against us and it's just not how to look at it is who are very um [noise]\nBut I can tell you I've always been very much conservative guy I was Ronald Reagan's biggest fan and I can tell you I I made sure I watched his inauguration on TV\nOn January twenty Nineteen eighty one and I felt better as soon as I knew he was president oh in the house just have to come home that day a story that gripped the country for over here and\nEach subsequent year I started seeing more money in my pay check and and business exploded salary was going up by leaps and bounds and I didn't even ask for a raise\nAnd I had other friends to everybody seemed to be able to buy a nice car living in a nice house there was a lot of action and I told my daughter without naming Trump specifically I said I Hope you get to live through a period of time in this country like that because it's really great\nBecause you're not worried you know a a thriving economy which ours is a\nHelps everybody there's even an article in linked on drugs and maybe we'll look into a little bit later this as a\nLiberal students admits Trump helping the economy [noise]\nYou know it isn't isn't that what we all want a chance to earn a nice living and enjoy the nice things um\nI think with Kevin I think I watched I got back at the hearings and you know they can't beat them on the law so they've got to find a way\nThe word fame but they have they have to find a way to get credit him and they can't do it by his record than they have to they have to go on the hunt to find somebody who's going to say something\nMy God man now all of a sudden a I don't know about you but the term cold feet comes to mind like I said if somebody did something to me of that nature", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Coosada", "day": "07"}
