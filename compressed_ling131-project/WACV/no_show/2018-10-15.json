is the gift that keeps on giving the great pyramid\nIs forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfect ... rock\nPointing exactly true north to south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years allegedly and yet we know nothing about it\nA few short decades after Cleopatra's rain is Barrow any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egypt shouldn't history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read I highly ... nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything and it all happened virtually overnight\nExplorers they would travel to Cairo\nThey'd look across the Nile and say you know I'm a music air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that you know and the answer air quotes we don't know you know but it's really big [laughter]\nThat's that's it it took nearly Eighteen hundred years to figure out the language and he would think that was all of the expedition to Egypt over the centuries that someone sometimes somewhere would have shown up who knew how to read write or speak any of it but it never happened\nAnd then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the wind mystery by Robert Duvall and that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the Germans were aligned with the stars and it's just that that just kind of open something up\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more\nAnd uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I have to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I started a Udall communicating and I met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise\nAnd uh and I met Robert shocker a few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um few couple of years\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those ads linked to night on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast ham scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the row uh newest first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight uh you and a Robert football and Robert shock sat down and started discussing uh the the strings\nAnd ... at least that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulb started going off that got too involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is this goes back to Orion mystery\nThe two gentlemen yet the authors um I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds the three pyramids or an online and and want it to align them with the three belt starts with a wry and they had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great pyramid the first one of the three you know\nAnd so I looked at the statue I started looking at the statue of he looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while as so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on a on the pedestal of that statue\nUm I noticed it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the or the book the that they just have co authored origins of the things which is an amazing book by the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section he's developing a you know something that he knows when their dreams the law which is you know in front of the policy of the ... between the positive things\nAnd there was a a so he was talking basically about the things in this guy and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about this things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the truth it's built if there was a schemes then it's it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remembered the line is on the pedestal\nOne thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page Robert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or at the um\nI think it was causing the origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and we uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it\nIs a this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know the two listened to my opening comments tonight\nYou know why is it that the ... well the gays applied to in general but you had the great pyramid the great things are two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut he's not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt in history where you would think well you know the do tunes love to write everything that he loved to scold didn't tell their story and not only that but taxes and and accounting in season everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the great things in the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nThat that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I I mean you know the one and so you could give is that maybe we just we haven't found a record so the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or maybe total absence\nUm and of course that was the problem with the things you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nAn inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have and hope\nWe found something that leads to things um\n[noise] the pyramids we um you know when you are next so that when you buy the great pyramid there is a tune from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years\nAfter a you know ... was alive and if you walk into that to them there's actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the uh in in in the children's called or the whole rise of food and next to it it's the um the you know the the country is great so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually Humphries pyramid\nSo they called at ... grade and coup was pyramid was called to Hawaii of Google\nAnd so this was a brief that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the block to and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is the glaring exception you don't really see too much or into the pyramid\nYeah you wouldn't expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have that but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other ... about how was builder who built under the year was build you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it ... all\nThe way to have auditors um you know fifth century but see now this was in during Persian rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know are you saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plot so and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up the blocks but\nYou would think that he'll just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just his confusing is ... and we also have those same issues and if there was a for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella ... we may not know anything at all\nBut yes that was the dream still a is a ... you know there was a dispute or at the turn of the um twentieth century\nThat may be tougher laws to foreign who is the author of the dream so between the positive things that he is the one who build it that was actually being debated\nUm but uh and there is a there is a small\nReference to fray but it's it it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that you build it [noise]\nUm and so that's the dream still at the end mentors the law on the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when ... came ... when I ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same as the ... the Greek name who posed the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that the human towards the United states very under critically when ... came to the plot told this things already exist that in fact it was broken he repair that\nAnd then he built his pyramid and that one the end the pyramid of his queen Knutson\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leading off right now this coast to coast damn I'm arrows to church or against the nightly news said ... and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nYes it on just goes am\n\n\n\n\nWalking back to the coast to coast am I'm married to my church it's the great pyramid all my big or we get to the great pyramid\nOr ... minute say it's ... am I knew we were talking about the inventories tell and the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward and end the dream still up\nA top most the fourth says mentions and and illustrates too ... says there and desert Fox just tweeted\nIs there a second ... thinks well there's two ... says there I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... is there a second ...\nA great question I'm so that was that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the second things uh as\nIll but uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is a ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these depictions are um you know they're on the unmistakable\nSo so the answer to this question specifically of course it hasn't been found there is there are stories uh Arab historians referred to\nAn actual things on the other side of denial which was dismantled and you know the granted was used to build mosques so they're they're ... Lee was physical things\nAre on the other side of denial but is there are things buried under the sense that the west of a conference pyramid it's possible\nThe ... you had mentioned that a coup foodie opt\nSaid that he repaired this beings but builds the great pyramid there are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just a repair guy\nBut he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy\nUh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as he had of course ecologist most causes do not accept the inventories the euro as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we countered there's arguments so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but\nJust to be fair to both sides um so what's your question\n... the ah you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of the ... there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egypt she means to read it means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the with the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is pet him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a\nA is a is a strip of ... where you know the pyramid building has mentioned and the the verb ... this is not further a qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuilt\nUm is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even\nThe you know the ... of ... that was found in ... in the right to see\nYou know they're saying well you okay this is the powers talks about tour store and being ... uh shipped to keys or um but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that is correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who you mean it was a ... interview you have written the other day he made a good point you said that\nUh he thinks the way it was billed as that first of all the perimeter was build and then it was back failed and so that means that if you shipped towards ...\nFor a ... as you went up to courses and then you ... so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their own mind about it\nAnd there was a quite a bit of relatives are in a you know pyramid like who who was dealing with uh also one of the gains a plateau why could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramid\nThere are you oh you mean in the image or some of the U.S\nYes yes there is a there is a reference to a head Knutson\nUm Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who's who in the news and so she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he build a pair of it for her at the southern most of the three ah off the three a queen permits that are on an indie east field in on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but in the human Tori Spelling it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting this dog because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a print says so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that she I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we've we think the poop shows that she was a princess so that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then you know there's mentions of ISIS and hop or\nA an old Cyrus on this and that those are much further reasons why each opposes reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this were an old kingdom story or at the time of who these ... ah you know ISIS although size we're not yet a working worship there were not official states sanctions or in the eighties and we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's a contentious I I I don't want to make it sound like we have the answer we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nAnd then there's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling may don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same answer with the same pair\nRight and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect those to be just as elegant if even you know more complex you know they're not and they're the stone work is is is just awful\nYeah well there I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing a A R is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just that common that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit could take a closer look at the craftsmanship\nAnd I was very impressed with the few casings stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old kingdom I'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old kingdom\nNow let's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above\nBeen told over and over again and it it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there is nothing there\nWell clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is one of the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing [noise]\nUm and the and what I liked about it is that it was non invasive um you didn't have to drill holds you didn't have to you know like a\nA duty early explorers they used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful and nowadays it's kinda like the pyramid is telling us you know you wait until you have the technology to\nTo find out about me or without destroying me and I think now we're

there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the rules to ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth\nCharted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial and she has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves\nAre into this things are looking for chambers and then you know the one that you mean just mention of course we know from seismic analysis that there are ... the our space is under this things\nAnd one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert shock or was founding a years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um they might be something that's of interest\nYou know he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back with another research expedition to hopefully drilled right\nYeah yeah first well what we\nAre what we would like to do first as to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced uh five small graffiti and maybe electric conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know what you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven\nAnd ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw a space about two meters\nA deep and uh and and then Roberts uh you know did his studies ... a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that cause phases five meters deep so we have a little bit of a deaf problem and then of course you know that's I have often marketing drilled in that area\nBut we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so they didn't really ah\nOf course they had other reasons why they were ... so what we want you to do is you know just like a you know it's like a radiologist you know where your first one to do a non invasive study and really finding out the space and we'll be having a good idea where it is then with permission of course there were try a small probe into that space and see what's at at\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about and there's this this this rumor has been going around yea for quite a while it would just be great to finally uh put this to bed wouldn't\nAbsolutely we think that if we think there is a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and thinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see the the water coming up and if if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber and so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber or the very first thing we have to do is to\nA very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue\nWhatever might be inside um you know so there isn't enough it becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert things it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly\nSpeaking of the things that just came in on Twitter this is from Baldwin is uh on Twitter and I have heard that this things may have been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for its body\nYeah well if we think we think\nIt was a female lying so that part is partially we agree with that yes I don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lie in us there before and the head of the line as was carved into a what we see today\nNow um I Know that you tend to be a little reticent to talk about alien jury team when it comes to geese\nI leave all doors open myself but this comes in from Lucy in winter and and and this is I'm just gonna have to read

long time ago and I've found myself\nAgree with that uh that's one way you could read it I you know I think almost every Sunday to undermine that originally there he's talking about the ... yeah or the right the lid off to a conference of ... right I have\nHave that's our topic is in my studio in the bunker\nAnd I have a reproduction of it hanging out in the wall right and I stop and I look at that Manu and I don't have any other way to look at it that was set up for the controls hand controls an oxygen mask slain coming out of a a rocket motor on the bottom\nYou know I don't have any problem with that I think this is a this is one way you can explain it and and everything is in this day and age everything's on tables you just said we're going to Mars\nUm the odds that there is into I I Know somebody recently published an article saying that there may not be intelligent life out there but I think I think there is it's a very likely and especially the physics of of a of the universe you know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this\nBut it you know there is one way\nA dentist like Robert Duvall proposed in cosmic wound is one way you can explain a some of these contacts as it may be a message that gets broadcasts across the universe through you know through um ah through a quantum fields\nAnd that message ends up on our end somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid\nUm I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is but we have to have some proof I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see some solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line or a Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake when he have per minute\nA absolute owners during his really quickly or ... struck me when you talk to her a structured space lose a look or make a couple of quick

and they could do even brackets people assume that the the ... the ah periods are solid\nBecause they know maybe just maybe your city is structured spaces be I'm sure we filled with forty I learned a lot and everything you know arches in Saudi comedies like Campbell\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's exactly the conclusions that my news presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and voids could there be more\nYeah so I have to you know I've been I Need to have to mention shop here who don't so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this if he if he's on logistics basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and the scan from last year business show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that the scan was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm seeing that could be the logical and shop here who don't would probably disagree with me\nOr you know your review the paper a but he's still things is possible that there were logistical spaces in it but you know beat out as it may so we agree there are probably spaces up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh because the pyramid of cool pool\nIt's is it hot spaces inside researches in his sixties went to offer his pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you

in there for his son ran in their ... their friend in the air Marion Jones fan in there and um the lion\nThe genesis where um\nEven if we found like that could that possibly be the original spot in the garden and he thought\nThat that is the million dollar question Mary Ann thank you for that uh my new gardening beaten in Egypt\nUm yeah I well first of all I I Want to recommend an author to you a merry I'm a David roles so he's a he's really done some excellent work on the ah ah basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nUm and so you may find some answers or you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's written books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think Timothy Mahoney if I remember this correctly [noise]\nUm but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the uh the early ... um when they were in Egypt um I think\nUh there is for specially Joseph I'm that's what the role is describing Joseph real figure and uh I live in a in a place called a virus which is in the delta\nAnd had a palace and was that was basically a A N tuned in the pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears and this is archaeological evidence and well piece together um and David role is basically saying that\nAh where are you worried historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a in the new kingdom and it it David role is finding that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis I just came in on Twitter this is from Jay hoops and he says I heard that surgeon tools were found in the ... that doctors use now true or false\nUm I ... well what was found is that a is a a tool that looks like a ... a like a small it's like a fish tell\n'em what on I I'm not sure that was a surgeon's tool but of course we don't know um it was found in the I think it was in the northern ... shaft of the queen chamber by a wait a minute Dixon\nUm and he uh and it's now and the British Museum a with a with a ... with a granted ball um but whether or not that was a ... and other than that I don't know of any surgical tools found in front of the games are pyramids\nLet's go to bill up in Oregon bill you're up next on Kos added Manu\nEmanu Hi Jimmy yeah the really academic discussion tonight and I've got nothing nothing against that congratulate you on your discovery question is um okay so I just want you to speculate on but if the huge chambers or for construction in engineering\nCould they be like for instance for architects to put gold on the Internet or could um if their theological could it be you know some sort of burial chambers for her those are the king wanted to proceed him into the um afterlife yeah great question decorating caution bill\nGlad I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate now I I'm I'm looking forward to ... I think because there is obviously I'm proposing up to ten chambers I was thinking well what if it's your logical what could that be and I think the answer is the end that\nSo in the ... are they are illegal plus what's known for the center of the warship up to nine major costs\nAnd I think\nAh these chambers are dedicated to each one of these these these\nAnd and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one that is the crucial chamber or wherever you may find the kind of things that you just mentioned um but I'm suspecting there could be piracy worlds and there are with inscriptions\nI'm so that would be very exciting if that if we're if that were ever to be found\nA but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm all I think I'm withdrawing here will die I think this is still on the table that there may have been spaces there that help the workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible\nUm and we'll just have to wait for the next county I think the next scan will give us some new information\nNow I have heard some rumors minute that\nThey have already gotten the inside of the new chamber above the grand gallery and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I I'm not I have any one of those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nIt would certainly help the tourism I mean it ... the less right\nWhich has dropped off I Am heard you know you just got back from Egypt I haven't heard from so many friends that have been going to Egypt for decades\nAnd that you can as a tourist because ... years past it was crowded all the buses were there you had to wait in line and there was a you know thousands of people on the games the plateau but today you can ... be the only person there\nYeah that I had there was a couple of days when I felt like that Jimmy I um you know it was not\nThere were there were parts I think he's a plateau where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders\nSo yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new museum and uh and of course they have to if they discover something they are they're going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I that's why I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that we'll we'll find out about it\nAnd this uh this is from Twitter this is from David I Love this question actually did the Nazis research Egypt in areas as depicted in the raiders of the Lost Ark\nUm that's a good question it is a great question it's a great question rush it um\n\n[noise] you know I I I don't know I don't know for sure I Know that Germans ... this is before before Nazi Germany\nUm there there was of course German activity on the keys up until there was actually a great American German a collaboration on the gives up blood toll or George rise from Harvard and uh and ... from a from the German a fun life sick\nAnd they were excavating them stop us and either but this was more Nineteen you know ten Nineteen twelve and ... into the twenties and then when a Nazi Germany came about uh some of this was halted and there was a big break\n'em but specifically Nazi Germans what they did in Egypt I I don't think I can comment because I don't know\nLet's go to a show out east in the Bronx Joe you're next on goes\nHow you doing Jimmy I'm doing good Joe say Hi to my new\n[laughter] I'm a new how I could take your good um yeah I wanted to ask you are in the case of the great pyramid is doing\nPassage ways that would connect the great pyramid to other pyramids in the vicinity and also can you tell me whether there are any signs of blueprint that exist for either the great pyramid or any ... in that area\nIn our kitchen I'd recommend them to anyone who would like to upgrade their kitchen give any coal seven nine nine Ninety eight Seventy three to set up a time for him to give you ideas to update your kitchen or looked him up on Facebook accustomed cabinet renovation seven nine nine Ninety eight Seventy three\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center says is W.

I think that if there is there is there ours basis under this things the main question is does it go anywhere or there's just a blind LBJ that's the main question\nYou brought up something else too about I'm Andrew Collins now his\nHis that is one of the craziest videos I have ever said I mean it is nerve wracking and if you've got claustrophobia in any way you watch that video and you almost can't get through it but he did find a a tunnel\nWest corner where the bird uh two was thought any finds a hole in the back of one of the tunes are for these birds that were there\nAnd it turned out to be hundreds and hundreds of feet long dead stretched out and appeared to continue underneath the pyramid complex\nAnd there wasn't supposed to be anything there then he high was who had denied that there were any tunnels there later went on to his own expedition and film crew\nAnd went into the tunnel complex which again was supposed to exist but it does\nBut there's also a potential pathway from the ... or from the uh the Cyrus shaft\nUm you know that's I I don't know if it was ever explored but I Know Robert was down there ... was down there filming and there was actually a documentary years ago\nI'm In you know he was really excited about the shaft um of course these Republicans are telling us that these are you know late period shops and these are not from they don't get to the old kingdom\nUm but you know I'm not so sure it might be that the upper ... the I'm Talking about the specifically I'm Talking about the old Cyrus shop it's possible that the upper two layers are laid kingdom but the the lower level is much older we we don't we I don't think we know for sure\nAnd it may connect um but yeah without a probing um nowadays we have the technology to probe very small spaces um but yeah and until we get the data we just don't know\nYeah you're talking about the two of us iris\nYeah the to write the access is on the south side of the ... of conference causeway\nUh and then that's how you and then you go under it and then uh it's three layers or or ... three levels rather and the lowest one is the one where you have to start off our cars submerged in water and the surrounding that debates and had sort of the shape of the era glue for house\nI'm a and a and you know it had this conference inside and and the the four pillars around and it was fascinating\nUm you know this ah this some the symbolism of it but the dating of it I I'm I'm a little bit doubtful about the official story\nWhile they went down almost a hundred feet and the and the Hitler's that were surrounding the area where there is our topic is again underwater or those four pillars had fallen over but it was something that was also supposed to exist on the keys a plateau and there was\nThat's right and so any inventories the ... you know we talked about it earlier there are so Robert and I think they're the uh the the the MIT dimension of the house of Cyrus\nOr on the inventory steal it actually may be referring to\nHave two that are ... Cyrus shop we think it's possible that is referring to that or Campbell's too now my cleaner is saying that Congress to them is a late period tune belonging to a no official called um ... cop or something like that\nCan't remember the name but again that's just the same issue you know how do we know for sure that that was in a an older to him and then it was being intruded on do we think we know\nOf ... before we uh they had to the break at how much do you think is still love to be discovered on the games applied to there's an awful lot of sand there\nYeah but well my my favorite place to look at it and and of course Robert\nRobert favorite place to look it would be a besides the you know ah besides the left paw is in front of the two temples if we could dig deep in front of the temple is you know where people now they have a watch the light show or\nThe passage that we think is under the things it could be in front of the things temple\nAnd then the other thing is we I predict and they'd mentors your paper we're predicting\nThat there may have been also a temple or east of the valley temple a and that was dedicated to Cyrus and that would be also underground so that would be one of my favorite places and then you mentioned as things on the other side is there's things on the west side\nYou know of course it's that's a great place to look a is there another things maybe those three places will be my favorite places to go\nWhen you look at what I find the most intriguing about the games are plateau of course everything facing western facing the ... ah there's there's a lot there had been for reasons with the causeway and the entrances and so forth but\nWhen you look at the original survey maps that were done in the Eighteen hundreds of the games are plateau there is an awful lot of that is being trained the uh the pyramid complex facing\nA west in northwest there's a lot there and\nUh not only were the tunnels represented all the way back into the early Eighteen hundreds but there is a construction that is represented in those of original survey maps that really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there there are some places in Egypt that cannot be export because there are military zones or you know for example the the northern a pyramid of subway it are we on a you know this is an incredible amazing plays\nA with a huge trends and this oval ... coffers placement\nUm but there's nothing going on since the sixties because it's a military zone so yeah I mean to your point in the in the west field way out and I do notice for a fact I don't know if this was a military zone right now but you know some areas are basically off limits and yeah there was secrets hiding under the than potentially\nAnd who knows where we're going to be able to urge them\nWe'll be right back just as coast to coast am stay with us\nUm [noise] um [noise]\nNever missed a detail issue is ... ... email newsletter available for free ...

I Know it's I I I haven't looked into this in detail as far as I Know but to me is not discover it but you know maybe it has been discovered and it's not published as possible\nAnd what was your second question Carol\nOr without being in archaeology is how do you go about getting involved with one of their research grants\nYeah that's a great question I so yeah I have to I Want to make sure I explained to her every one so I'm not an archaeologist I'm also not a credential Egypt calls is this is for me it started as a hobby and all of course it's a serious endeavor\nOr you have to be associated with an Institute a research place or an university which I Am now I'm a you know\nUm and so then you can apply for permits and do you have to you know you have to do the vacation you have to as a they have to review the application and they may say no\nAnd you don't have a recourse um you know so we'll have to see if they allow it but if it's not me it's okay or someone else you know my my I think you know I wanted to get the information out there are other people can see it other researchers\nAnd they might be able to get a permit to investigate further and that's okay with me\nTo do the same thing Carol are you researching on your own now\nOn ... and and what they found that out of carrion why ... added that in the national news you twice\nYeah and and Carol or one of the things that that I like to do and I encourage others is blog right research and and and publish and self publish yourself and and continue because once you start to do that because I Do it myself and and certainly sodas Manu\nThat others out there\nAre attracted to you and they will find your information and then they started sharing their information with you and you suddenly have a network right in front of you so I I encourage that I encourage blogging\nAnd creating your own website just like mine who did and and look what happens in the end let's uh let's go east of the Rockies is going to Manuel in San Antonio Texas you're up next on ...

Marshall are set to date and meet with members of the Alabama\nBoard of pardons and Paroles 'em and they're coming under\nThe board is coming under a great deal of criticism\nFor their work or trying to enforce Alabama's parole system\nUh Darryl bally's raised concern about it ws if he's done some pieces on it a top state she's been following it on a daily news um\nI don't want to kind of I I've been asked by several people to get my thoughts on it and I've resisted to this point ah [noise] and the reason I resisted this point is\n...\nAnd not pro criminal not pro criminal and not necessarily pro inmate\nUh but I Am pro human values\nI Am pro human values in Alabama is making a decision\nAnd sometimes in action is a decision\nBut Alabama is making a decision on a daily basis the governor of the legislature everyone involved\nTo not expand\nThe capacity of prisons in the state of Alabama nor to expand their capacity for humane treatment of prisoners in the state of Alabama and yes even murderers are entitled to a humane treatment\nBoth morally politically ethically ah\nI I Can't I Can't I Can't explain it any better than that I mean even Jesus said go visit the people in prison you know there's there's humanity twenty five twenty twenty five thousand people are locked up in his humanity that are locked up in Alabama's prison system which is dangerous overcrowded\nDoesn't provide the rehabilitation these people desperately need it basically just warehouses people for a period of time and then if they can find that within their own heart if they were raised right and have training sufficient to\nDeep down rely on then maybe they'll get out and there'll be a success story like our caller Roy who calls in after twenty three years in prison and hold down a job and is uh\nHe doesn't he doesn't run from it happen um\nBut it was not a crime that involved a life sentence and if you don't give someone a\nThe death penalty essentially then you're you're\nAcknowledging that one day they need to get out one day they need to get out\nAm I'm irritated I guess with the news because what the hell do you expect the board of pardons and Paroles to do what do you expect them to do\nWe have inhumane overcrowded prisons in the state of Alabama\nAnd there are some people\nWho need to be let out of this in order\nFor our prison system to match its demand we have more supply of prisoners than we have capacity and we have to let some people out\nAnd it's tough to pick and choose I mean there's some bad dudes in prison some really really bad news\nBut\nThe last time I noticed a lot of these people complaining about the people being set free by the board of pardons and Paroles have not been lobbying and advocating for increased\n... prison space\nHave not been advocating for maybe a tax increase to fund it\nHad not been advocating for anything that might actually prevent what they perceive as a terrible injustice witches and frankly it's a little shocking people being let out of prison after a couple of years\nWhen they've gotten sentences or Fifteen Years or more life even being let out of prison five six seven years into a life sentence shocking particular if you particularly if you testified against that person with the confidence that they would be put away for life particularly if you're a victim of that person and now they're going to move back into your neighborhood\nAfter killing your brother your uncle or your cousins\nOr your neighbor\nIt it's it's disconcerting I get it I totally one hundred percent understand the concern I I could not be more sympathetic to the victims in this situation\nBut at the same time\nThere are economic realities in the world there are moral realities in the world is it more or less moral to send a prisoner back into the neighborhood\nThat he murdered someone in or or got caught selling drugs for the test time or or rape someone is it more moral to send them in there or is it more moral to have demands on a prison system\nThat are so stretched thin and so I mean you have guards getting killed in prison guards getting stabbed in prison\nCorrections officers who dared to do their job and they don't get paid well for it and the life expectancy of a corrections officer is drastically lower than yours unless you're in some other ridiculously stressful field\nThey get sick this is a illnesses and things that you can't even contemplate\nTo life as a corrections officer is not easy it's not easy at all\nIn the prison system a dilemma\nYou have one and a half paypal or two people for every available bed you gotta let some people go\nOtherwise judge Myra Thompson is going to order them all released at once and no one's going to be able to keep track of them\nAnd I don't know what you guys expect over W.

greater cheat but look we say so far\nIt's always so far till everything's done I I you know dealer deals okay whether it's a real estate deal or a retail deal it doesn't matter but I Will say though is\nThe day before I came in we were going to war with North Korea I sat with President Obama we were going to war we would go to I think it was going to end up in war and my impression is an even in my first few months I mean that rhetoric was as tough as it could possibly get doesn't get any tougher then that nobody's\nEver heard rhetoric that tough we were going to war\nWith North Korea now\nYou don't hear that you don't hear any talk of it and\nHe doesn't want to go to war and we don't want to go to war\nAnd she understands date nuclear ... he's agreed to it and you see that he's

that ah\nI've actually said that and no one who really don't know missiles more missiles that we don't really know Leslie we really\nKnow but I assume back last may the answer is yes okay let's I mean\nThat I'm interested in exchange with um with\nSay showdown North Korea to change voted ... to go out\nYes go see if we said yes good uh but yeah that's interesting how I I think it is clear and it was my big worry too it's what bronco bomb apparently now presidents or write the letters and vote and that does for their\nUh the predecessor a writer for the incoming president and that was the biggest issue with North Korea also said that to uh\nOver there so I think the um there's going to be an interesting\nRight now the main thing is that they're not firing missiles and that's that's the part that they need to happen but are firing missiles and or detonated nuclear bombs and that's an accomplishment itself but it didn't seem to be enough\n\nYou may have an air there's going to pop up here okay we're about ready next position from next course okay let me see are the questions or okay now is going to be talking about China in tariffs here\nScholarship and across the world here you slapped a lot of\nParis island fifty billion dollars going to do more light lives abound three they want to negotiate lessons they want to negotiate are you reading a book or you ready to have a great chemistry also\nWith President Xi of China I don't know that that's necessarily going to continue I told president she we cannot continue to have China take five hundred billion dollars a year out of the United states and the form of craze and other things\nAnd how how and I said we can't do that and we're not going to do that anymore\nMuch squeezing of them are you prepared to do when American products are going to be more expensive for American consumers in the end of all\nThat so so far that hasn't turned out to be the case if you think about it so far I put twenty five percent tariffs on steel dumping and aluminum dumping ten percent agave retaliate if that's what I'm asking you know he tally it but they can't they don't have enough ammunition to retaliate we do a hundred billion dollars with them\nThey do five hundred and thirty one billion dollars with us are you trying to sort of pushed them into a depression no no although there are down thirty two percent and four months\nWhich is Nineteen twenty nine well that's I don't know I don't want that I Want them to negotiate a fair deal with us I Want them to open their markets like our our markets are open but\nHere in ... right now ... you go to war I and you ... you call that I called actually I called in a battle but I actually I'm In a lower that I consider it a skirmish\nSo that there's a vintage Trump pair and roses song is really trying to egg egg and my own on this\nUm\nAnd drugs to do in a very good job in my opinion he he really is a history of the questions that you get to the point she's trying to push 'em own some things which we were borders should do but she seems to be taking a little too much of it is going to the next when we're talking about you\nAnd we're going to win you of also slap some ... tariffs on our\nWe have wonderful relationships with a lot of people but then once we don't want to teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union but why it was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done but this is Hamas and yet they it's not hostile sounds hobby you know it's also the way they treat us\nWe're not how cell but can't even daily within within the stupid country for so many years are you willing to get rid of that western alliance now\nLike they don't then is fine but you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect you up and then on top of that they take advantage of us on re elect going to do it any more they understand okay but if you\nLike it does seem that they are you willing to disrupt the western alliance it's been going for Seventy years that's kept the peace\nNo that is it true General Mattis said to you the reason for NATO and the root of all these alliances is to prevent World War three no it's not true what frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you tend to try one\nOkay now you know unless you're not try it again I Know that whole and my gosh the answer is this I Will always be there\nThey want us as Leslie for coming to our country illegally and part of\n... I mean part of the reason I have the blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states and I just ask this simple question yes or no or are you willing to reinstitute that policy you said we're looking at everything math\nI ... and you can say yes and what I can say is that there are consequences from coming into a country namely our country illegally I'm not going to ask it again you don't have it but it's the same as Obama okay\n[laughter] see let me do when he was talking about the press you could feel among that when you could really pretty them and it was more of go back to that if you will lose so say I'm\nI think we're there was the second merged into the to the other one and um when he was talking about the prayers who is very passionate about it you can really feel that uh he felt that God's going to look to there'd be nice to me and they they're worse and worse are much worse and\nProducer during the transition how unprepared T he was so ... says continue wound here with the ah the interview\nChanging subjects again you are the first president to the United states who never had a political post before or never served in the military we've come up here and you've been here for almost two years what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned\nSince you've been president okay\nSo I always used to say the toughest people or Manhattan real estate guys and Bob\nNow he's saying they're babies who have the political people this is the most deceptive vicious world it is and vicious it's full of lies deceit and deception and make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with that table give me an example I don't want to give you an example I'm not looking at\nIn the meantime nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do remember that\nWhen you look at taxes you look at regulations you look at uh making deals with other countries [noise] nobody's been able to do anything like this actually most people didn't even try because they knew that didn't have the ability to do it but\nIt's a very deceptive where all the other thing I really learned is I never knew how dishonest media was I I I really made it I'm not saying that as a soundbite I'm now I never knew how to change the subject to get well no but even the way you asked me a question like about separation yeah\nWhen I say Obama did it you don't want to talk about how I when I was going to run your answer but you did it for time I'm just telling you that you're treated me much differently on the subject I disagree but I don't want\nFight with you hey you're not if I look at the time I'm president and you're not\n[laughter] that was one of the stuff that they're that\nWas right let me tell you the he's really um\nHe he's really finding his way here let's who shows are pretty tough cookie but\nHe he was really emphasizing that part of the press and I think that that's a very effective tool\nFor him to do and if you if you kind of an independent person and you're watching this I think what you're doing is you're saying to yourself man this guy was doing pretty good his his whole June in here where most people think that he cannot do that\nSo now he's going to get into the disagreements to that that have happened in the administration and then the Ford compromise to go for the testimony that did and they kept hearing\nThe cost of this country is divided polarized within families there aren't even people who can talk to each other what does this say about where we are as a country right now\nAll this division and just try to anger or it's going to happen I think the economy's bringing people together it was very polarized under President Obama unbelievably polarized under President Obama I can see the country uniting I can say is we have people Democrats who behaved horribly\nDuring the judge\nYou you you know what I'm saying but when you do run rings for the Supreme Court we had senators that behaved\nHorribly when you one you want now no one is going to argue with that I wanted one and\nYou won instead of saying oh let's all come together this is wonderful what's he'll all of it you come out and bash\nWell I bashed their attitude I bashed is why not try to going as they were unfair to judge Kavanaugh I never seen anything well I'm not trying to we\nTo be healed we mean I don't think they want Dale yet I'll be all you want\nI don't think they want to be healed I Do want to you I'm not I'm not talking about Democrat I'm Talking about the country who go out and you go to Mississippi so famous Mississippi ...\nDo you think it was I was wondering\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you just don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when\nProfessor of philosophy forging mimicked her\nMade that speech we would not have one but\nI was just saying she didn't seem to know anything you know and you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary why did you have to make fun of her I didn't really make fun of ... is the\nPerson that we're talking about I didn't know the fear the time the plays professor blessing for God before the Senate and and was asked what's the worst moment and she said\nWhen the two boys who laughed at me at my expense and\nThousands of people were laughing\nThey can do what they I I Will tell you the way\nNow justice Kevin always treated\nHas become a big factor in the midterms have you seen what's going on with the bulls but did you have to\nWell I think she was treated with respect and all the other side what do you think there was no reason to do you think you treated her with great so yeah I Do but you seem to be saying that she lied about what you know what I'm not going to get into it because we won it doesn't matter\n[noise] interesting thing about you need to bring the country together but she didn't sit there and talk about what the Democrats did in the Senate and the mistreatment of the Democrats of Ford\nAnd this is what happens is you get hit and what you need to do a hit back would you need to do is is kind of came we'll get together as long as soon as

I Do I feel like the president you know for a little while it's like a Mr President sure it's even my friends they called me that they don't call me that all of them as they call me Mr President I say we please loosen up\nI've learned on the job I have and you feel comfortable I feel very comfortable audience\nHe um he really does have this one of the ... you think about the um the interviews he's done in the past this one was was really good he's really stride\nGood things that are happening out there and that kind of gave me ... ... and his confidence here we should say a risky so said he was a very different person in this interview then he was in the um the first interview she did\nAnd she said you know he was like he was kind of stunned that he had one and now he has confidence I think what he's done as he was the things that weren't working it was the things that were working as you said with that they just moved it over very much out of the order the deal\nAnd I think he's doing a very good job with that if you guys didn't see it we may have to try to um get up on the website or something but um I wanted to play it for you because it was so much in there that um\nThat I think he he did really really well speaking of which of looking at a set of the numbers and things that there is some new polling data that just came out over the weekend it today for example\nIn Nevada the Senate race that was owned the injury list she was losing then he went up by two now ... is up by seven there are some cases that the Democrats don't talk about but there's some voices like in uh Virginia\nThat is a um house seat that may go Republican there's one in Minnesota is one in New Hampshire there's one in Florida is shut down or should I remember her from the Clinton Administration from a person in Miami University she's learning in a very Democrat area\nIn which has a very Hispanic\nTone to it running again is a soldier's or\nWho is Hispanic and white now she's winning that seat about five boys those are three seats that they actually might pick up there on the congressional side now they're going to be some ... loses out there there's one incumbent in Pennsylvania there's a there's a loser there's another I'm\nDemocrat in Washington that is a Democrat said held in Washington right now the Republican is winning there\nBut you may have incumbents lose at a way to Eighteen of the Republican side but she may actually pick up for a Republican seats that gave you at a mine is Thirteen number\nWhile standing Sam\nAnd it was a great great audience\nShe was so engaging and she had little kids get up on the stage where third bomb us get up all the states with her and teenagers get up on the stage where there and when I was just a name really engaging person that I had the good fortune of being able to go backstage and talk with her for a few minutes and\nWe gave her a gamble that was seen by a tree that was planted by founder back in Nineteen forty a guy named Paul Harris and the tree got knocked down on a\nTornado in the Nineteen nineties and instead of thrown under the carpet they took the pesky Rotary Club turned it in to a money maker and make they make gambles out we present it to her\nAnd she loved it and um then we named it it was called faith and hope\nAnd then uh it was called faith and hope because she wrote a song back in the nineties called faith and hope is stronger\nThan the what's it called the ... tree and I quoted those that are birth to her and she started crying I remember what it was just amazing but she was wonderful\nI cannot I just want to extend my thanks for the people in Montgomery because they really came out you know being a football weekend\nBeing a friday night with watching kids play football daughters cheerleading all the other activities going on Montgomery came out in droves and it was well worth the effort and all those people that\nThat really went out and bought some tickets in\nCame and really I think they were surprised at how engaging and how good she has a voice is stellar and so we we're we're very blessed are very fortunate and I just I Want you know we we probably wouldn't have had a happy all that except for the dam\nOr what to say that Dan Maher al ... and I you know I had any\nQuestion on on the participants have this they were where where's the participants from everywhere\nOh they were from fourteen states from Texas Oklahoma hallway to Illinois and Ohio up to the lake and border we had people from Denmark we had people from South Korea we had people from Venezuela and so he was an international event but we had primarily people\nIn the heart of America that runs straight through the north and south\nAnd it was over five hundred people and most of these guys were\nA kind of like me they were the district governor or in the district of chain\nAnd in leadership positions in more baloney or who's going to be the international president of all one point two million all this is from Decatur, Alabama and so to have a a native Alabama and being in charge of this is something special and he is a great speaker he he gave us a great inspirational speech about leadership\nAnd it just it made a big difference but a lot of people\nTell you something I say I did when I was saying people from so so far away but one\nNew community and with the word we club a to a couple were at church or a visitor to say knew somebody that was here this is relationship and um and I met them and just they said many Montgomery is just a great place\n[laughter] well I'll tell you and they had an opportunity we we let some of the people or how often do some of the museums some\nOf the memorials a lot of them because we're downtown there's so much history there you know people really had a great opportunity and wants\nTo whether Clinton or a you know the last weekend was absolutely fabulous near where he was on Friday Saturday when they knew for these\nFolks gone out and got to see the nice thing that I was able to do is there's a book um\nAnd it's one of these coffee table book come out and it's just coming out what's called Montgomery and the river region in focus in this bind Jennifer ... and it down to kind of a a presentation of all Montgomery in\nAll twenty states this ... tang these are the leaders from every district ... and as a parting gift we gave them this pictorial storyline Montgomery and I think all of them were extremely\nHappy to see it and it gave them the momentum to want to come back and we had a A R B the Palm Springs economic ... says he said that\nBecause of that five hundred people that have come to Montgomery it had about a million and a half dollar economic impact on Montgomery so go figure that's a

driver and Auburn\nIn okay avenue or boulevard over there is not in the middle of nowhere ... somewhere that you do not want to be caught was were out at nine o'clock as a pizza delivery boy oh God I got to drive out ... is an object clicking clicking okay\nTowards like there is no lightning on any of the houses and you're kinda just walk into somebody's ... are hoping in a in a pit bull in the yard lived on ...\nA year and let them but but that's what best best the monument\n... what I Want to bring back this controversy idea that people feel empowered cause of social media that you now have a voice you can post it and he's on corn interview get more people together you can post and you can get people canceled all these thing\nOh well yeah get giving voice to the people right isn't that will be given voice\nIt becomes a server ... it's more power play on people's part than actually wanted to hear people out late I brought up the rock is now he's hoping to produce and he wants to star as John Henry\nAnd a new retelling of not just American tall tales and folklore but one from cultures around the world and there'll be like an ensemble cast okay and it's all sort of different you know modern day mythology okay\nAnd he wants to buy John Henry and there was a backlash to ah there's some people were really upset some people are more like I got a problem with this one I'm looking at you rock I'm looking at you\nSaying that John Henry was he's the man who beat the steam powered locomotive like I remember I remember from Nineteen Ninety five feet tall tales yeah Disney Pecos bill's thing John ... the guy beats the machine mailing down\nOr the ... like spike\nAnd they are and spike in to steal spike in order to set the dynamite now he beats the machine and there's all these you know song from history and people have investigated was he a real man but in like you know in that tall tales movie from Ninety five yes\nJohn Henry was a dark skinned black man okay if you see the rocky or like the rock is not an ... he's ...\nYeah so yeah some under tones and things like that people were like how dare you rock\nWell and one person and this is what I mean somebody on Twitter who do I know this person no I should just care about everybody who tweets something in as an opinion but she said the rock is is black when it's convenient and racially ambiguous when it's convenient\nWell that goes for most mixed stars right but then there are kinda that's that's just like Jessica Alba pain that she's more white and she is yeah well it\nGets to and I brought this up affair it gets to the point of like how you to find a particular race does become a bit absurd\n... well but the thing was he wasn't complaining about that other side of our heritage is helping her get parts cause them by getting a lot of the parts that just got out but get early in her career was because he had that exotic look ... addict name\nRight will ... this is what I mean is that it's it's a bit absurd and the sense that how just if you go based on how people look just like a knee jerk reaction what does this person look like\nNumber one you're not really getting into like why they want to do that role why they might be good for that role for instance the rock\nIs producing it em wants to star in it of course because his father rocky Johnson who was a black man yes it taught him all this history and told them these tiles yeah so this is like a childhood dream of the rocks going Johnson to play John Henry [noise]\nWell you and so because your mother is ... and like the the daughter or granddaughter Peter my of via the high chief of you know they like and all of a sudden you can't\nNow wait a minute but it was people who had a few saying the Disney movie which is a classic now marijuana and people have problems\nWith him being in more than I was like he seemed really who else could you have gotten to play that voice around ... ... exactly you know my my little niece still sing that song that You're welcome so I hate that song but she thinks it like crazy she loves it but\nI don't know you can't and I go back to what my grandad he taught me very young you can't you will never please everybody\nOh of course not ever well this is where I'm like why do we get ... why are we allowing Twitter and the so called voice of the people to be the factor and everything\nDifference is not just like right or wrong independent of what the crowd or the mob things\nI understand that but see the difference is\nThe difference from uh back in the day to now is that those people always had those opinions you know it's just they they couldn't voice ... you didn't have a thousand people they could just call you at one time and say this is what I think didn't have the platform exactly now like you say you you have a voice to the voiceless\nAnd people pay attention you know one of the thousand people were telling you you suck right you can start to believe\nBut here's the thing number one and this is why I'm skeptical of democracy of what we mean by this majority rules in anything whether you're talking about but specially political power ...\nWill break it down from it rationally politic right now I I Am much more fan of say the bill of rights that says all men and it should be all men when all human beings is what the I think the true spirit of it is\nAll human beings should\nNot necessarily hasn't happened all the way throughout the history but the idea ideally all human being should have these basic rights freedom of speech freedom of religion to own\nLand property personal possession seem sort so now now now not to be a falsely accused and then have to prove himself and said no they're presumed innocent because they're presumed free\n\nPresume free and they and these ideas I like my point of view is uh-huh as my favorite amendment as the ninth amendment is that just because we listed say the freedom of speech and right to a jury trial and all these other rights\nDoesn't mean that your rights stop there this is not a ... an exhaustive list your rights are is numerous\nYour individual freedoms because your individual free person made an image of lightness of God is the idea back then ... then there's no way we could list all the ... the ways you can ... and you let me I like that better than I liked that better as a restraint on government\nThan a popularity contest who gets two percent or more okay\nBecause I think a a fifty percent a majority can be just as tyrannical as a king or an emperor so whether it's that came in for a queen or the majority\nYou cannot violate these rights mhm okay\nGotcha now what I find funny is that people who wrote those very same rights that they were trying to get get away from England and stuff like that\nYet at the same time a lot of them were slave owners some her own ... very very a lot of them a lot of them were continually sleeping with their slaves at science mhm wow all this has been being written about freedom and all this stuff\nWhich kind of sparked you know the slaves to ask the question like wait a minute what does this freedom they keep talking about they're trying to get away from England where we're trying to get away from him\nJewelers specializing an antique an estate jewelry diamonds high end watches more by selling trade with
