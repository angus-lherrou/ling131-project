here too and I want to speculate with some rich car at the end leather so today's show is called\nA ... pair to board the flight and uh we just heard a flight take off a minute ago you're doing pretty good with these little side deals you got it while\nWe were the airways and the\n... the the movies you're putting out and everything you know oh it's fun yeah you can hear some of these things over on the YouTube channel just to go to the Facebook pages or David Ernest our health and well David Ernest there's a link there and uh you can go and check out some of these things that we are talking about here\nYeah I mean he is very frustrating when you're trying to follow\nThe rules and regulations ... waiting around to board a flight to know the rules and all these things you both do take any ...\nHughes all shoes own worst my belt no ma ... fall right when that happened I Know it uh they say oh well take your shoes off they stink oil okay\nA quarterback but if I go\nOh you're Seventy five you don't have to do this oh you where you look suspicious ... we've got to take over here to the side we got to run this thing up and down you know I used to Hugo I empty pockets you know a lot of time must look very suspicious because one of the last times I flew there was me\nAnd ah this ah this nice looking young woman uh-huh they pulled me and her\nOut of the line at two different airports here\nAnd I told her I was maybe we should sit together or something they're going to get us you know like they have I don't know why they were checking me it was the weird thing is I say this woman in a wheelchair over there and they were running that thing up and down and and she's obviously almost a hundred years old yeah you know that's the ones who got in those planes and did all that stuff yeah hundreds of your own happen with our\nGovernment making ... unless I'm not I want to be protects\nThere was a you know the same way with your money ... some of these rules can be read Dickey\nLess I'm all for protection I Am Mr protection but some of the rules that I have to fall to protect you are utterly ridiculous but dams to route\nAnd they're so stupid some of whom and I'm saying 'cause I've got to still got free ... speech I guess if I hadn't heard nothing in the last thirty minutes or so you know these rules now rules and regulations are required and they're needed to point\nBut when it gets to worries die falls in ... mothers ... ability for you to get to where you need to go in order to make the money you need to make\nYou know when Trump came in yeah he came in and he'd be regulated a lot of things mhm\nWell we could fly higher you know in stock market is still going up and I'm I get it banned I get it I Know that's probably the right way to do things right\nBut it's the same time you need to have a safety net you need to have protection and you have all these things but for us to go through all these things we have to go through to give you that in other words\nCan you believe that\nThey don't get it yeah they have been through so many ups and downs they've been through so many bad things that happened in the economy bad things that happened the government\nLook look at look at nine one one oh those airplanes just flew in and hit the building there was and there was people they knew that these foreigners if you want to call it that [laughter] we're studying how to fly\nFor seven seven forty sevens are seven ... seven and when I didn't want to know how to land on and didn't want to know how to land ... what was wrong with that picture think about it\nThere's a lot of things that people just ignore what I'm not getting involved with it or not going to do the ... or there's somebody else's problem you know when everybody says well that's not my problem there's somebody else's problem ... eventually the buck stops somewhere ... sometimes you\n[noise]\nMan\nLegal and never ever ever hit the ground\nOver there you go because you know they're they're they're smart to know where the eagles do was saying there's a store bought like flap above that smart God give 'em in good sense and I'm Glad you said that\nBecause that's what I Want to do with the portfolio right I Want to fly up above the store that all the folks\nDown there who who didn't do what they needed to do that got to deal with that storm Europe there and if you're above the storm sunshine by hurting you're just you're just waiting around up there you look down and you see all that other destruction and half of thinking I Wonder what the poll people do in today yeah\nAnd they say why did you go so high why did you go so high above everybody you say you being high and mighty you took all these these these uh extra precautions and you went above the storm why did\nYou do that and then they look down and say\nOh I Know why you did it make sense now there you can relate ... maybe maybe not maybe not if you if you think it might be [noise] remember to seven nine seven four three one we'll put you in touch with David ... be flying lessons show you how to get on up there in the stratosphere\nWhen you've got to be careful you got to get to where you do when you got to be careful you can't be too scared not to take some ... like\nEverything has a risk element in life it doesn't matter whether it's your money\nOr your your your your health or what you do for a living or you know what you do for fun\nAnd people you you could become\nWhat was that the the the movie called the aviator I Believe it's called the one with a Leonardo DiCaprio and he I asked a Howard Hughes yeah he he became such a isolationist or you know he he was bigger than life to start with me even took on the Congress of the United states you know\nAnd he won a I think a but in in the long run he became\nIsolation mhm game he went down he\nKinda got to be an nuts or I mean he really got eccentric right and uh you know he lived a last stopgap Fifteen Twenty years of his life just in seclusion right\nRight and I had all that money all that money I mean I guess I just go to prove that will show you that money can't make you happy but nope it can keep you from being real real sad well they've done studies on how much money it takes people to be happy in in ... and there's the numbers that of\nI mean I don't know what the number is but I read that too long ago it was Seventy five thousand they would be Seventy five thousand some people's I'd be happy you know some people say up to Seventy five thousand you become\nMore and more you get closer to Sandy five thousand happier here and then after you go over the state of five thousand the kind of like well OK why might not happier but he started getting other problems it depends on the person and if you were in a big company and you did say any five pounds and you'd probably broke okay I mean that's not happy but so it is\nIf so if you're in the air with an airplane and his relative about how you're flying but it's also relative how you land in other words if you fly somewhere and you can't land it\nDidn't matter where you ... it didn't matter how good you through there if you can't land the plane you you're gonna\nMiss that other beat up all the peanuts in it or you're a good so you got\nHave a landing a mechanism ... you got to have a way to land safely if something goes wrong in the market you need to be able to land safely and not crash\nThe that's the that's the difference in the way I Do things in the way a lot of other ... there's all these different mixes of portfolio mixes and things like ... but I'd take the absolute\nGuarantee teed\nBuy insurance company wrapped you're still going to be a mixed to those two points but the insurance company is guaranteeing there's an entity is guaranteeing no loss not just a\nMix tried to protect ... not it might ... not ... you know may hunters have this thing where they don't always work real mixed up mixture a mixed up mixture so you can ... you can mix to to to conservatively if you mix to conservatively\nYeah you're not going to lose money go down to the bank you put the money in the bank that's a that's a way to conservative mixed because now you're making one and a half two percent return\n... right now it best\nOkay uh back in ... years ago you could have been making a Fifteen Percent return where that's a pretty good a guarantee you that if it ever gets to a Fifteen Percent again are twelve percent or even pay and\nDon't put your money in the stock market at all I can tell you that drive and and we have ways that we can make that return better than the bank because we're dealing with interest rates mhm but\nRight now the interest rates are low so we're dealing with a hodgepodge of things to centrally these insurance companies are trying to make sure that your flight is even killed in in in in not bumpy\nThe road to retirement is not bumpy you don't want a if you're up fifty thousand feet in your retirement and you're feeling real good are thirty six thousand feet wherever you fly at all of a sudden\nThe\nThe list goes away\nThey said don't worry about it it'll catch down there around Fifteen thousand feet the market to catch it\nEight thousand whatever ... whatever the ... I don't know cry and all of a sudden you fall from thirty thousand to Fifteen thousand feet and then it catches when you say well I'm I'm not going to crash where you failed down Fifteen thousand feet so you did lose out or to you and your stomach\nYour altitude you just lost and do you have time or power or enough energy to get back to the thirty thousand but what I'm Talking about is we have a way that we can stay at thirty thousand feet if the if the engine cuts off\nWe glad at thirty thousand feet and we are safe and so you don't want the engine to cut off you know to ensure that your engine does not cut off\nYou should call David aren't as to seven on seven for three one remember he's got that Web page over there at a retire with Ernest dot com\nYou can see him on Facebook at a health and wealth with David Ernest go over there and like his Facebook page and you'll find the link to the YouTube channel where a bunch of our old programs and some funny stuff on there just for your amusement but\nYeah your your airplane near\nAerial plane what did you want to call it if you've got a car you've got insurance on it I Hope it's allow you know yeah if you got a house you got insurance on it and if you've got a jet liner and you're a company you got to insurance on a big old jet airliners yeah don't you think they have insurance on it yeah if you crash in that\nThey get paid so they can pay off your folks yeah and they\nSay what I'm saying is the way it works and you know even even with that you can walk through that airport there and they got that little thing they'll sell you some insurance\nThat Israel in case something happens but the thing is that's the kind of insurance that pays after it happened ... wouldn't you like to have insurance that keeps it from happening yeah\nOr if it does happen they guarantee the life of the things if what if you can ensure that live in such way that the laugh was lost that'd be amazed that's what I'm Talking about I'm Talking about this kind of insurance that's when you start a laminated people you know\nYou just last week I'm over ... just yeah you'd have to bring put some food and water and every once in a while right\nSo if you the thing about dollars in money is that it can be replaced and if you lose ... but there's other ways to ensure that you don't lose it at all and that's a ... is lost that the companies are backing it up like insurance ... any time you hear something says\nGuaranteed no loss there is only one entity that can do that and that is a ensuring company mhm okay so if your portfolio is insured against laws ...\nThat's the only way it can be done if you go to a mother kind of advisor type person they can't say we guarantee that your portfolio will not be laws they start talking about other ways where we can put you over and this and that will be a little safer and we'll put you over this and this and this that and the other and that's okay\nBut if you own I sure claw clear way that you will not lose your money today or tomorrow\nInsurance is the best way to be absolutely knowing that there's no way\nReally lose your money\nThat's why the man has been doing this for Thirty years he knows all these uh these methods like I'll say tricks their tricks their methods right there there are also another uh\nAnother another go to war methods like I said good methods of getting the help you get into a situation where you will have a financial future that or you're just looking forward to you retire you're actor fishing you worried about money you got David Ernest on your side\nIs likely is used as an allergy before you're you're you're flying along and you want to make sure that if something happens you go to heaven right there yeah you're good so you got all these different methods that you are religions\nBecame of course the majority opinion and the Supreme Court over things like EPA overreach and in in many areas or what land water air\nUh it's just a brilliant judge for for North Dakota when he's on the DC circuit\nAnd so she has this opportunity to to prove her brand and she blows it by voting against him and her whole brand went right out the window\nNow and then our campus is like well it just doesn't fit with the north Dakota's coda a mindset in the\nThe spirit of North Dakota which is one of ... hearty courageous I'm well still still has that frontier feeling on the ... than that it's not a very populous um state but it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet Neal just wasn't fair and I think most people just bought\nAnd so she's obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him but I think that was the straw that broke the Democrats back\nIt was ... but at the same time you know I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and\nAnd I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just blew up with the cabinet thing because again her everything she's pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration so and the fairness issue is really big but also\nShe's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney general so the idea that you didn't understand fairness or due process of the value of it at a time Laura when the polls in North Dakota\nNever showed ... never showed even thirty percent support for a for opposing kept an eye but rather short anywhere from sixty to fifty sixty sixty four percent\nFavoring confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt wasn't like she didn't know where North Dakota so she had a hard time and by the way even ... blaming her ... she changed her her opinion first she believed him and believed a progress report then she didn't believe him but believe professor for it and then it was not about that\nAt all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing you know with the sound turned off and noticed his demeanor and you know just ... it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the veil removed because everything you described about North Dakota's lord that the independent spirit that they ...\nThey frontier spirit that's what she has pretended to be and now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nNo I think again people have been my own but then exposed during the Trump era\nThen the media has had a ... mirror um\nUh and it comes out in different ways but Trump really has driven people ditches peroxide dozens of frenzy in theory and upset and\nAnd the last always takes it too far they took it too far with Kavanaugh ah we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump critics but people have a lot of theories there um\nAnd I and the leftist they're never satisfied with they get one thing and that's like okay we're going to go to the ... and now we're going to push for universal health care and it's going to be Medicare for all and it's going to be health care for illegal immigrants than a one less than that you\nYou know assuming un what's it looks like you're going to um congressman and North Dakota or what lesson did you share with others who are listening across the country about about this period and politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep this prosperity going obviously the markets had a rough ride last few days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy [noise]\nNo you know the main lesson I Would share and and I you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the thing I Would share is ...\nLet's return to a respect for states you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy called states will show the way in North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the so with the states that I Would consider bad states at places like California North Dakota is the second leading producer of\nOil in the in the country not because we produce more necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously in technologies unlocked it but but because places like California that have lots of it has screwed it up\nOkay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life but\nI I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at at at the state level and that's what President Trump has done he's restored\nStates' rights and and that's what we're together but cabinet does on the courts and ... and just trust people at the most basic and local level and that means with their tax dollars that means with regulations it means having a respect for a return to\nCooperative federalism and you're going to find the federal government is far more efficient and much less not necessary frankly in many cases and you'll have a you know you don't have a much better country in my view\nUm congressman finally or a month at a time but your thoughts on these packages arriving at the residences or offices of Trump's critics\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more diligent ... and it's frankly it's scary but\nMy my main thought is let's please not jump to conclusions let's you know this is less than twenty four hours oh let's let's calm down let's let the FBI and the other law enforcement agencies do their work\nAnd let's see we're all of this leads before we create something you know different than than the reality that it that it is behind it all in the meantime it's always a good opportunity for self reflection on on our own individual behavior what contribution if any we make to this\nThis discourse that's going on this lack of civility and uh without pointing fingers today I think it's a good time for us to look at ourselves\nIt's a great way and I'm putting it um and we really wish you the very best in this election coming up on November sects Kevin Cramer I think it'd be the next senator and the great state of North Dakota I think North Dakota is the only state in the whole country I haven't been\nOh I'd love to give you an opportunity perhaps for celebration or maybe in January or February I write that'll be or dominate

normally are disgusted\nWith those changing\nIt on a limb and hasn't been a disease\nTrump says he he\nUsed to come on the show really once in a while\nYou have to separate your own personal views

whatever you want a let's go to branch in Iowa on line three Brent welcome\nAri great I think we're looking at this so long I think we're looking at the wrong way I think with all the coverage on the coming up from the south and the dams losing ground\nWhat better way to come up with sympathy for your caused by changing the narrative and I think this is a left wing conspiracy I mean because nine inner bombs\nYou know what better way intending to all the prominent Democrats\nUh you know I I'm just speculating but it just kind of makes sense I don't put it beyond them at all\nI don't know\nI don't know what the [noise] I don't know what the truth is I I Do know that we should wait until we have actual information\nAbout what this is [noise]\nUh you're listening to your health a radio station a five five\nForty ... a lot more than ...\n\nIs not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management my story begins\nAnd and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call if you're inducted and you need help\nCold trinity a one eight hundred seven nine for ... for three something\nWhen I first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I looked at the

improve your credit score you'll save thousands what I Would tell other people please pick up the phone and called trinity just let them put together a program\nWell it seems again that we have a very odd and yet obvious kind of list of people from a political standpoint all of them\nAre are critics of the president on all of them outspoken critics said the president of course you have President Obama and so forth but does that tell us anything the kind of obvious nature of this last\n[laughter] yeah I I mean I guess that speaks to uh some some motives behind why they're doing it I mean\nIt's it's detracted from any other news that found them on the TV right now this is where you're writing from view of everybody else\nSo I don't know what political motives are trying to establish here what they're trying to ideologies are trying to push forward but the bottom line is there's a clear cut a destruction of of normal normal news that would be out there\nAnd when you think about\nHow this individual would be track what again with authorities be looking at\nLooking at um you know trying to\nDid you get a techniques but it's I mean right up right up front you be looking at a fingerprint analysis from a tape of device or um\nYou know the other other a ... that you can use to to get um DNA evidence off of off all the device if in fact the last I mean you're never gonna have a completely sterile\nUm uh item there\nA specially since it was wasn't ... I'm a bomb squad um there's lots of injury a value to this um which they should be able to ascertain a lot of information over the next few days\nWell it seems also that they've had a ah they've had an ability to to know that some of them didn't actually go through the post office they were hand delivered or one on initially said it was delivered by courier the stamps weren't actually stamped\nThat's all well ... yeah it is odd and you would think someone had to pay for that so they should be able to to track down who gave it to that person who actually delivered it trace it back to where it came from I mean\nThere has to be some kind of accountability to to a courier service to who who were they picked it up or they got it and how they got it there\nNow if it's an inert powder as it looks like it was again not meant to detonate calm another comment that was made yesterday was that if you're going to send something\nAnd and and you really wanted it to cause damage you wouldn't send it like this like a letter or a letter bomb apparently can be make much more lethal than a package like with a pipe\nThat people kept saying that you don't send a pipe bomb\nLike this through the postal service because it's too easily detected is there anything to that\n[laughter] well I mean if you look or you know historical data the uh\nBombs have been used you know through the mail um\nEspecially when you have like a you know Ted Kaczynski and what you do this or do the Unabomber stuff I mean you can use the the post office or you use other areas means or a courier service FedEx or whatever but\nIf you're going to do you're not going to use what they used to in the last few days but you're going to use something that's not the technical um look at this again refer back to the FedEx incident that we had were the the devices actually went off\nUm those were intended to go off these ah these are intended to be found in my opinion they were meant to instill fear in people that's the bottom line there\nAre ... and again that is just my opinion\nUh Brian Morris uh Ryan we appreciate your insights here and we'll bring you the latest as a press conferences will be taking place throughout the day on this issue with these ah no is it their terrorist uh they're ... they're not attacks and that they they didn't\nAchieve their go if they didn't achieve the goal of violence however they're terrorists and that they do terrorize people and they're meant to intimidate and dominate the news ah\nAnd get attention and perhaps make a political point of one sort or another but we don't know yet we don't know exactly what one town I'm with a lot more to get to on the lower income show the campaign\nOr heating up both in Florida where we had another debate last night between Rhonda Santas and Andrew Gillum on now is tightening Gillum had to open up a sizeable lead over on defense if the Congress men for that all important governorship\nIn the sunshine state and now it's you know about six points\nAnd Andrew Gillum is now having to explain themselves and given the fact that he\nAccepting gifts or from a lobbyist well it turns out that the land developer that he believes the land developer turned out it was a a a FBI\nHad been surveilling him and it looks like he had and walked right into the trap and I thought he could get away with lying about it I don't\n... to me this whole thing is very strange with Gillum claiming that he's not under investigation how can they not be under investigation when the FBI had this ongoing operation involving him\nAnd ... with text messages now confirming that he knew he was getting theater tickets other benefits uh from someone who was ultimately the developers thinking favors\nTrying to use his brother Marcus as a shield for the past through these gifts so Andrew Gillum and finding himself in a heap of trouble and of course the playing the race card in order to avoid answering the the tough

I basically work it out for like a twenty hour work week and I multiply that by the hourly rate so it's consulting so uh you know I can have worked for three weeks and then I can be a no work for you know months on end\nYeah but you're going to make three hundred K. that's pretty clear correct\nWell that that's even if I get twenty or twenty hours a week okay got it on the earth All right\nBut is there is some question as to whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week ...\n... ... that's pretty moderate um 'cause I I've spoken with some of the other people that work in that position and um and they they say that's about average um yeah OK yet but they made out for months for the day I get a paycheck and\nYeah but ... this is a no brainer because you're completely debt free you've already gone all the way through baby step seven you have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape to take this opportunity and here's the other thing you've probably planned for it yeah what is your three to six months emergency fund look like how big is it that\nFifteen thousand yeah I mean to sound a little bit how long would it take you to get up to thirty or fifty you know a ... with her position\nYeah or just in this new position 'cause you're in such good because you're such good shape you you know just taking a new position you can stack up some money and take you know my point is is let's say you get into this new role which you really want to take and I'm telling you to take it\nBut let's say you're healing that the first three months live on way less you already can anyway so the new job is actually going to allow you to maybe put six months away\nSo you got no risk at all because you can jump back in the cyber security I think it's a no brainer I think you're over thinking it because it's not the forty hour week a buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where you can take a job like this you don't have to work forty hours a week okay\nTo celebrate tonight my goodness don't oversee this I mean half of half of the audience is going to love to be where Cody that right now [laughter] I mean buddy this is the kind of smart risk you know because you put yourself in a great financial situation to be able to go after this there's really hardly any risk at all um\nMan and here's the deal you're saying that you all you have to do is get twenty hours a week\nAnd that would put your three hundred K. if you only do ten you're still going to be making about the same it's not even a little bit more of course you gotta be making more so again go go go oh that is fun stuff triple eight eight to five five two to five is as a career seem out on the day Ramsey show I'm Ken Coleman city in for days to go to Rachel is on line and Madison, Wisconsin Rachel how can I help\nHow campaigns are talking to nature I'm I'm twenty four years old and right now

everybody in America's listen to that going wow that is extremely valuable who doesn't want somebody who can do that [laughter] pick\nThe industry I mean think about how valuable you are and again I Want to remind you something Rachel I told my audience this almost on a daily basis here's where we sit right now in two thousand eighty seven million jobs available in the United states seven million\nIt's historic there are more jobs available then there are people who are unemployed and you just told me you're really great at systems and processes and you're really good at collaborating

that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dog ...\nHave to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new it finds them for you\nAnd so I'm here to pick your brain into areas number one what was your past\nWhat are some areas that I could get better and where can I grow but what do I need to learn who else do I need to ... do you have any relationships do you know of any open jobs this is a very simple conversation it's going to yield something positive\nAnd so this is proximity and then even if there's not a fulltime job available because Nelson this is the this is the part that I Want people to get that are in your similar situation\nLet's say you do all of that and there's not a position that is right for you at the time\nIt doesn't mean you throw your hands in the air and take your ball and go home what it means is\nYou say All right I'm going to practice proximity in a in a non paid situation so I'm going to go volunteer or or I'm going to say hey can I just shadow you for a day I'm going to get in places where some type of audio video production is happening and when you get in those places you will continue to meet new people\nAnd those new people will help you get in the right places are going to open up doors for you so you're on the right track the first step is just talking to your body that's just the first step and that's how you ... practice proximity is people in places\nSo again folks if you're in a similar situation let's apply Nelson situation to you he needs to simply asked today and then start to ride it out and find the answers when he goes and looks on line or wherever and he makes a list who are the people that are doing audio video production in my area\nWhere the places what companies are doing this and that's what he's looking to connect to it's not difficult it's going to take some intention alley and some hustle that's all it takes triple eight\nTo five five two to five let's go to Joe who's on the line in Charlotte North Carolina Joe how can I help\nBut he can big fan big fan of the heartland the organization appreciate all you do think you\nHave so I'm I'm looking at a I'm kind of continues you know I Want and I'm Wondering if it when I got as a hobby or district career so just a little bit of a back story that's a good paying job and excellent benefits to pursue at that with my passion I think about ... percent pay cut to make the switch\nAnd and I went to the new profession you know and I quickly learned that I don't know 'cause right now I think I might have jumped the gun ... I just want to get an inside of you\nWill tell me what the profession is that you just jumped to\nFinancial diving what is it a financial diving\nOkay so you jumped into financial advising specifically what are you doing day to day give me the quick rundown\nA day to day are basically just knock on bookstores who I Am what I Do and you know trying to get them to meet with age though that I can help them with a retirement plan and education\nSo are you working for a local farmer geo open up your own shop\nAnd you know it's a national um\nOkay so they're not providing any leads it's all on you to go out and knock on doors like you're doing\nExactly they provide the early okay\nDid you jump into the I mean I I think there's a question you may have jumped too soon 'cause you didn't plan financially but your question was is this hobby level you know is this the right thing for me and and and the ... in there is a little bit more to it than that I think I have a hunch on it but quickly why did you jump for this why financial planning\n... and you know we've had a passion maybe being able to help folks with the financial planning out retirement or you know which is a term you know to kind of told my story you know that you can make a great and um you know just just no truck came across that I went with it and it's if it's not working out\nWell did you planned financially for this\nOr someone you know about three to six on to the extent to which is a critically depleted ... and uh you know I thought I was gonna you know and then every job that always had expelled do you know I thought between you know get burnt go in you know ... you know and and uh you know I look I'm working on commission\nHave even al well here and you're like here's the situation you went after a a financial advisor role\nThat's what you went after because you want to sit down and help people with their finances\nBut the problem is you signed up for a door to door sales job that that's what's going on and I don't know if straight commission sales is the thing for you\nThe reality is you need to get some feedback I mean today from your leaders are and maybe some some of your co workers to see why they think this isn't working pretty quickly you got to make a decision or and so maybe it wasn't the right place maybe it's the right thing but maybe it's not the right place 'cause he's got the talent to give people advice and coaching\nAnd you have the desire to do it maybe you're just not in the right format to the right setting to be able to do that so get some feedback reassess let's get stable and find a better scenario\nBut don't stop moving for\nAAA eight to five five two to five is the number of coming up more of your calls the career our on the day Ramsey show [noise]\nAsked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where\nYou are and your baby steps it's a necessity\nNot a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace a stay at home parent responsibilities I only recommend term life insurance sense is the most affordable way to get the right amount of coverage and not break your budget go to ...\nDot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two these are the guys I personally use ...\nLife insurance is inexpensive and your family needs this no matter where you are in your baby steps that ... dot com or call eight hundred three five six forty two eighty to ... dot com\nEra's missed out of these were flea markets and antique mall falls year I mentioned the emphasis biggest change where I get\nGuys on different kinds of merchandise is coming in from beginning to get the town's mayor in which means\nTake science everyday\nTell us just a bit about these markets and antique ball\nSixteen thousand square feet and around two hundred and ... we have an elevator and we have air conditioning we have the necessary we got\nFrom where we found really inexpensive during\nThose hours of operation Ninety can friday is in until Saturday as man into the\nSame day for thirty\nYour home look green for ...

I'm having a good day sure I Am how can I don't\nI'm just starting your program and I'm I'm not sure how to do it when there is no money left she said at the end of the night at the beginning of the month or any of them [laughter] and I was homeless for about a week and then had to live in a hotel\nFor about a week until I found a place to my own and then I'm just this is the first month that I was able to pretty much pay all the bells and fall and start to get back on my feet up that\nMy question is basically about I'm a ... a voluntary retirement scheme that um is in Singapore so I can put up to thirty five seven thirty five thousand seven hundred dollars a year and that would get tax relief on that\nOr that calendar year ... which translates about four thousand dollars in taxes mhm now I Want to take half my emergency fund\nAnd put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand jumps gosh blowing it felt my salary\nMhm border the penalties for\nWithdrawing or should I Do that one of the penalties for withdrawing I don't read for ...\nYeah it's about fifty per se or ... percent on taxes are but I I really don't need the\nEntire emergency fund I currently have thirty thousand among thinking thinking Fifteen thousand and put into that I can rebuild my ... my emergency founded about three months\nIf you don't need it why would you rebuild it\n\nI mean I don't have to have all the thirty thousand I just built that it's because I feel very comfortable with having a cushion\nRight and what is your income a year\n\nAbout a hundred and sixty\nOkay so what is three to six months of expenses\n\nIt is about twenty three thousand\nOkay that would ... that'd be three months or six months\nThat will be fifth month\nOkay All right so you can be within the range of three to six months of expenses at Fifteen thousand and um if you want to use some of that money that's fine and if you want to build it back up to six months later that's fine but it doesn't sound like you need more than twenty five thousand ever in your emergency fund\n\nYes but I'm not a citizen here I'm also not a U.S citizen I'm I work here on my my ex patriot and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to leave the country I have about sixty days to get all my affairs in order and leave\nMhm\nOkay so you're just going to keep a little extra well so what happened and that's why I feel what happens if that ... that event occurs while you're down on cash because you funded this thing\n\nBut it's very unlikely um I just received a new role and at least for the next two years of probably very safe at my work life\nMhm yeah\nThe thing is is here here's what's bothering me is the proper amount to have in your emergency some of those thirty thousand dollars and the answer is no\nDon't drain it down because this is not an emergency use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount to have in your emergency fund\nWhich means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later\nSo you decide what the proper amount in an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears\nTo fund this and then you're going to put it back which tells me you don't agree you know you've got your mind the proper amounts thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money in retirement\nDon't use your emergency money to do that but if you're willing to reassess your emergency phone and say I've got this thing over funded I'm going to back it down in the twenty range than I might go ahead and do this deal\nA because we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies\nAnd don't monkey with it as merge and she found is is is foundational before you move on to investing of any kind so you gotta decide your definition that is what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash want and it sounds like emotionally given the unusual situation that you're in you want to keep thirty grand around\nAnd so you should keep thirty grand around\nIf that's it don't mess with that but if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a cage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage our you\nKnow hey Dave how's it going better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nAnd thanks for taking my call today I'm\nI'm a college student I'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um but the more that I go through school and the more that I listen to you and makes me want to I'm really make a living being a financial ... many years ago and they'll do today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I wanted to get your advice on whether you think it still possible or somebody like me to run the type of business but maybe your eyes on the best model to maximize ... on the early going of starting\nTo well the um you know the based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you a fee just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we go we we have a program where we sort of our people that do that that come through our training to do that\nIs it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that\nUh because it's it's very much uh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours and the day for enough money to equal a good living\nAnd it can be done but are coming straight out of school difficult to do\nI'm not saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay it's not an eighty thousand dollar your job your first or two years out\nIt's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like one of our smart Mr prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals are in the business of selling investments\nAnd there's nothing there's ... there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact that it's almost\nParamount that you do coach people while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're

was giving instructions I can describe and speak to you as a very thin\nVery white pale entity I couldn't see her face all I Know it would very skinny it hadn't very long fingers\nHow many I don't know how many fingers that had it could have had five it could have had three I just remember one finger because I had the feeling that it was touching me with one finger and it just freaks me out in the rain I remember the environment\nBeing very luminous very white almost to where he was going to end your eyes\nBut I remember that being the strangest thing about it\nI was standing before it it was sitting in a very large thrown like chair but it was so then it seemed like a rope weather just dangling from mid air with Robie arms and it was just really creepy ...\nYou had this as a repeating dream yeah\nAnd the ... that you were describing the extreme sadness is it possible that this very white being is in fact a reptile snake\nI got more that it was more like an insect\nThan a snake because it had a texture to it ... it was like you know what a insect wings look like they're kind of transparent that you can see those veins or whatever and I threw it\nWhen I Lived in Florida when I was a kid we lived there for a short time in Jacksonville and I was always outside and I love and collect the animals and things like that but there are huge praying mantis as they would hang out on the bushes and the same boat arms and uh she\nAre you standing in front of this praying mantis like ... are you standing in front of it and it is in some sort of a crouched are sitting position\nI Want to say at the city position because by the this big huge thrown like chair that it's heated then it's very very very large\nAnd so this is perhaps an eight foot tall praying mantis\nIt possibly could be\nAnything specifically coming into your head from it as you stand there\nI think I can smell it I think it smells like rotting wood or something to that nature like consented to the nose\nDo you have a sense that there's any kind of clothing or garment\nNo I don't think there wasn't any clothing\nAnd the caller that is the praying mantis in front of you\nVery pale almost like albino Gary pale\nAnd there are praying mantis who's that can be white\n... so I don't think I've ever saying when\nDo you see anything in the eyes\nI don't remember the ... it's almost as if I couldn't look at them I think I was terrified to look at them but I had a feeling that this entity was in ... something to me because I wasn't a grade\nIt was almost like it was giving the instructions very strange I don't remember a voice it was almost as if it would tell a path ethic\nAnd on the being the praying mantis essence seem to be glowing like a pure Weiss\nWasn't glowing had modeled skin but it was Barry White you could tell that it had a lot of texture\nYou know if it was why it had like ... I Would say you know how it would be like model skin like someone who had crackles are almost like an albino salamander skin\nIt sounds like you are describing every Chilean skin not a praying mantis skin\nWith texture was like that yeah\nBut the form was like a praying mantis insect\nThat's how I Would describe it because of the army they were in ... and they were long but you could tell that they were joining could very strangely as I reach puberty I remember I started having a lot of glowing pain\nAt one point I did find a spot on my groin and it was like a puncture area that blistered I just had the ...\nThat maybe they were doing something with me to recover sperm or something\nBased on everything that you have experience with the praying mantis what would you speculate could be coming further\nI think everything is speeding up now\nSomething about to happen that feeling I get I get this feeling of urgency I get this feeling of it's too late to do anything about our current

also sent me the two fourteen to prove his military background like have included in the end of my earth files news report tonight\nThis email contained a life experience that he wrote up for me in titled quote\nThe experience that made me a believer that we are not alone\nAnd it began Hi Linda my name is Tony I Would like to tell you about something that I saw as a black child I Am fifty seven now but at the time that the incident I was four or five years old in Nineteen sixty five Nineteen sixty\nI was in my bed one night and I had woke up and could not go back to fully\nHere now from Winston Salem North Carolina that tell any town boy like that and him as a child and hotter tend to this very day is retired us air force staff sergeant Tony guy\nOutlived in Dayton, Ohio\nI was about four years of age\nI live with my mother and she had a best friend that she waited two bedroom apartment my mother had two children and my mother's friend had two children and we were all about the same age it's a two bedroom apartment and it's two levels\nYou have to go up the stairs to get to the two bedrooms and bathrooms and I was in my bed sleeping along with my brothers\nAnd two other kids and I woke up in the middle of the night and trouble going back to sleep and not just there in in the dark I couldn't go back to sleep so I decided to get up out of bed and I went to the window\nAnd I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet on didn't hear any color is that's how I knew it was very late in life because I didn't hear your car go by\nSo I'm looking around and I happened to look up look up in the sky you know just looking around 'cause it was really nothing to see a grassy field in between the apartments\nAnd so I look up and I see a light a bright light in the sky a suit it was an airplane that same light than I was looking at it because it was only putting in the sky\nI notice something was coming down there by the time my notes you may have been about I'd say ... years sixty feet off the ground the light that I was looking at came down it was or\nWhat I noticed about it was one half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was neon green color you know like the glow sticks they choose the at the concert when they had the glow sticks that are neon green glow sticks right\nIt look like that and I was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but there's so little all is if you cut the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it would have been if it were perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed there were two lights met in the middle a white light in the lime green light there was no bleed over you could clearly see where the neon green ended in the fall white began and this object it looked to be a stay in a balloon\nWhen you say\nThis was translucent and you could see through it\nYou know I could clearly seafood there was no metal nothing like that it was more like a balloon so clean and it's like you're looking at a seafood belong and what are you seeing\nWhat I'm seeing a person standing inside the fall white part wearing Gail and he's looking up\nJust standing there looking up like he's looking up into the bars I don't know what are you looking at it but I could clearly see this announcement here in the months we'll look at that this person and keep in mind I'm no more than twenty five thirty feet from the\nOnly reason I didn't climb out the window that night because of all those like if you knock out the screen and go down there you go on to the beach [laughter]\nYou know\nWhat I was like man I Want to go but bombs going to be you do this you know the notion you but I just didn't understand it but it was submitted for for this\nOkay this is very close to you if you are looking at this window describe the person that you are seeing in the white side of this circular orbit\nWhy give you my balk at the time and this is the conversation I was having to myself I was thinking man this personal looks like God\nAnd then I thought I'm not going to say that uh let's see actually pills God right and then I'll go out man the issue of looks like the guy in the picture at church describe everything\nA gal and he was worried like when you're looking at this fall why I noticed was bright or brighter colors and the white light you can tell the difference between fall white and bright white I could clearly see that the gal was white\nVery bright white he was looking up and he was Caucasian\nAnd they had a brunette hair and it came down to say\nA shoulder to shoulder lanes mhm and he was just standing there looking up\nWhat his hair straight wavy or curly\nI'd say we're straight dislike you when you use motion pictures or cheeses of ... ... it was like that\nWere you close enough to see the shape or color and his eyes\nNo I wasn't close enough to see that\nAnd what was the shape of the down [noise]\nFrom what I could see it looked like it pulled over his head [noise] all look like one followed these and they went all the way down to his feet\nCould you see his seat in this era ... craft\nNo I couldn't so how do you know it went down to his feet\nBecause I could see that we're ... or ... where he was standing at the very bottom of it I could clearly see the whole year it's kind of strange because like it's so humid it but I could look in the green part it feels apartment buildings on the up and shot\nSince I'm twenty five to thirty feet as a four year old looking out your apartment second storey window you are able to look through\nThe surface of the white side of this year a goal or or a craft and see the man inside the white side yes but you could not see into the lime green and you couldn't see past\nThe line and the white yes\nThe fact that he blocked out the apartment buildings that were beyond it seems to suggest that even though it appeared very strange to you that he had to have been

process and I said wait a minute there's just got to be more and I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality and began to read I began to study\nA I've been studying the ancient ... text in Hebrew I looked through other religions and mystical world and I do believe that the infinite is communicating with me\n[noise] what message do you sing to Ralph is trying to pass on to you what does he want you to know\n[noise] I find comfort in knowing that he's letting me know that the existence of him has not the best\nLife on earth for him has seized but the existence in the cosmic soup if you will does not stop and that has brought me tremendous comfort\nI I I was going to say it it must be in a very strange way of\nCourse to give you the kind of comfort to know that his existence continues that he's out there somewhere [noise] uh in trying to get you little messages every once in a while or just to make you aware that you know hey Dan I'm here\n[noise] well you know it it hasn't\nBeen always once in a while sometimes it's a little more frequent uh about two weeks ago I've been wearing his watch that I gave him on his twentieth birthday which is an automatic watch okay and I've been wearing it for the better of course of a year and a half [noise]\nI've not touched it it always keeps the correct time ten days ago I woke up I put on the watch I got my car I went to work\nAnd my watch was twenty two minutes behind\nAll I had to look at it a few times but it was twenty two men and\nDo you get behind the car and you look at a license plate and you see twenty two there to do these numbers pop up all over the place\nYou know they do pop up to me and at times I think they're popping up and at times I think they're not coincidences [laughter] so I really created a word for myself out of coincidences I'm calling them coincide and says\nBecause as it on a recent trip to Los Angeles and I'm thinking a lot about him and hotel I check into and they hand me a key and I walk up to the room and the room number is to twenty two\nCheese random they just give it to correct you didn't request it\n[noise] but I don't think is random I'm I have removed random from my

to twenty two dot com linked up at coast to coast am dot com we're talking about his latest work called in for twenty two about the life of his son ... cities that have occurred since rough tragically passed on\nJonathan I Know how tough this was for you when this tragedy occurred how're you\nI'm I'm definitely doing better one of the things that's really help to me is to come to terms with\nHow I think of the finite and the infinite and in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings have disability [noise]\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body\nAnd so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite and so in meditative thought in thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infant its own were each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat did you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\nI have to say that I I question that I didn't think about it much and ever since Ralph passed away I set\nOut on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nKind of the goals really did we get to them in a second three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the driver situation what happened there\nSo about eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver or a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want and he looked at me in a very strange stare\nAnd said I'll just tell them Ralph's on it and I looked\nAnd I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said no\nShe how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love that about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons of smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n[laughter] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and said we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nOr gets timing in secret as you get and then you had an occurrence would some strange bedroom lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty\nAnd the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with may occur in the lights back\nBut the light switch back down put a backup put it back down and they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off and at that time I left the house\nAnd just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nIt was a point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about\nUm [noise] I don't I don't fault Tam I have a struggle to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shield it themselves from any and all liability from every American citizens\nSo they're they're protected by federal law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJonathan was was we're all subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student or frequently making jokes he was just if you ask his friends they would portray just the most honest\nI'm likeable young man you could you could think of\nNow to go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stand ... they take some stuff uh you know they go to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the hospital\nI I think I think he was vomiting proof usually there was a lot of blood he went out with his friends who are all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that cold [noise] well I got the call after\nThe medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOkay let's go to some culture for your Jonathan let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington questioner story Hi Patty\nI ah I've I've got a little she tore and I hope it's relevant to this synchronous cities that I think I've got more and then you can shake a stick at\nUm it started with my son who incidentally was taken away from me when he was born we somehow managed to to make a connection uh that we can look back for each other on but he was born on my birthday three minutes apart from the same time I was born\nIn from there the increase in cities just roll in um\nUm we were both born nine fourteen which were nine fourteen fifty two it was nine fourteen sixty eight and every number we have to do it this is not a nine I mean ... of

mean you have some nefarious motive and talking about it I can assure you nobody at this station will make any money whatsoever off of comprehensive tax reform or the gas tax\nIt's just not there's not going to happen I mean the station might make a little bit if they did comprehensive tax reform because there would be advertisements purchase for a constitutional amendment that needed either pass or be defeated both sides would come and they would buy advertising and try to convince people their their position was correct so they\nThey might be a few hundred dollars made by the radio

know\nThey can't they can't nobody turns it off everybody list of her does see here's special election boring\nA of of of a ... foot complaint filed against the attorney general I got two different stories you're one from daily news one from W a survey about Melissa Isaac And Julian make Philips\nFiling a formal complaint with Montgomery County district attorney Darrell Bailey about Alabama attorney general Steve Marshall taking illegal campaign contributions I think it's beyond dispute he took illegal campaign contribution is I think everybody knows\nSlurs in packed a pack transfer money which is illegal in Alabama or we had a whole special session making packed packed transfers illegal back in twenty ten and then they re updated the law and twenty Thirteen\nAnd no situation did they say an attorney general just because he has the ability to do it should do it because nobody's going to investigate the attorney general I think there'll be we should call a grand jury put the text of the statute on a PowerPoint presentation of on the wall\nBut the text of the statute on the wall and point out what Alabama attorney general Steve Marshall did and then ask the grand jury does this violate the law does\nThis violates law because I don't know anyone who could look at it and say it doesn't violate the law I have yet to find an objective attorney who's not on Steve marshals staff\nWho thinks it doesn't violate the law everybody I think isn't universal agreement violates the law obviously the Supreme Court has not given as guidance obviously you're not been charged with anything but I think it violates the law I think it's clear it's it's illegal to accept back to back money in Alabama boom he's taken back to back money you tell me what you tell me what's legal and illegal\nIf anything it stinks it reeks he's going to win election\nLet me just say going is nice guy I'll probably vote for him just because I don't like Steve Martin just take a bunch of nice guy but he's not going to win the Democrat can't win in Alabama rotten twenty teens not unless he's going against a credibly accused child molester the only way Democrat can win in Alabama\n\nSo I don't know why they are filing these compliance other than it would be nice for Darrell Bailey take a look at it but here's the deal Darrell Bailey doesn't need a formal complaint filed Darrell Bailey could've looked into that if you want it to when it happened months and months ago and given us plenty of time to make a decision going into the election he's not going to do anything with two weeks

I I agree with you that no district should ever not have a say in who their representative it but the reason why I think this legislation was oh it's because the janitor can't Montgomery is wrong Bob election in the last\nSeven months correct and I think the ... the main solution to that one is an economic vacancy comes up it needs to be ill or an election needs to be called within fourteen day\nQuitting wrong took the president the of an issue in August and the election wasn't called feel October and the first\nDemocratic primary for that was December ... in a runoff in February then a general in April and and with the shortened session\nAt the end of the quandary knew him get voted on nothing right I think that you both solution is\nYou call the election in fourteen days and then you have one election ballot the winner what are your thoughts on that\nAh I I\nDon't mind the plurality as long as it's a a super plurality like forty forty five percent something like ... I don't mind declaring a plurality winter\nUh I remember a couple of years ago cloud chambers and Harris garner went into a run off when they when ... was had like forty nine point nine five percent of the ... I mean it was like two votes short of a majority correct um you know I I don't mind a super plurality being declared I don't want someone with\nI just wanted to get your thoughts on no party is I understand and the third year you got to squeeze it in ... they're going to go in January and they're going to go back\nI Want to do a jungle primary election anyway I think they ought to do it all the time but they certainly ought to get special in these legislative districts on special elections\nNinety eight percent of the legislature legislative districts are not competitive anyway and so a jungle primaries going to yield the same to people as the other one would have or it's going to yield to Republicans are two Democrats and then let them battle it out and just have to elections not a not election then it doesn't run off and then a general and\nEverything like that um and if if somebody gets forty forty five percent on the first ballot they go you know and and on a special election that ought to be the way it is\nI agree actually taking my call buttons\nAnd we'd be good legislators\nSolve the tax crisis solve the revenue crisis solved election crisis I can really\nDo that I could really do that government has either got a guy arrested in connection to these suspected explosive packages [noise] um [noise]\nThe man was arrested in the Miami, Florida area uh they're taking his car now it looks like or they put the top holding it over a van and putting it on a flat bed in plantation Florida ah\nSomeone is saying the guy is suspected to be a man in his fifties this is according to NBC's Tom winter says the suspect is a man in his fifties\nUm\nThe department of justice director of public affairs Sarah Flora's confirmed that one person is in custody press conference scheduled for one thirty pm central time to thirty PM Trump time um and there were two more I think today James Clapper and Cory Booker that came out today I'm\nSo here are the people that supposedly had gotten these Obama Clinton to for Biden one for bringing a one for holder to for waters one for Clapper one for Booker one for Soros and one for deniro\nSomebody didn't like the deer hunter or something what was that all of a taxi driver was too much\n... man that was a good [noise] um\nSo what will continue to follow that in there'll be rumors about who it is and everything else I think the longer we go without a name\nOr then the the less likely it is to be a white male Trump\nSupporter you know\nCome in here I heard the FBI use specially trained toxic masculinity sniffing bloodhounds to locate the white supremacist mad bummer [laughter]\nFantastic I myself have offered to diffuse these bombs live on the air and the news talk studio I don't believe these things are capable of going off not with the ridiculous construction and a couple of that I've seen I don't think they're capable of going to I Will take them you bring them into the news talk studio I Will diffused them live on there\nI Would open them up and revealed them to be the fraudulent things they are\nUm anyone who wants to bring a pipe bomb up here please don't I Want it to only be the FBI bringing in the pipe bombs that were discovered in this thing don't bring me a random pipe bomb appears they abuses because you might know how to make a pipe bomb no pipe bombs and blue water please no pipe bombs of blue water keep your pipe bombs other places\nIn fact don't make pipe bombs how 'bout that will just do a blanket nope pipe bombs nobody needs to make pipe bombs and if you do don't mail anywhere don't try to harm anybody don't try to harm anybody at all but I don't believe these pipe bombs or anything at the FBI brings me one of these lousy ... particularly the one I saw at the CNN picture\nI don't believe for one second that was a real ...\nNow what do you bet that this guy has had FBI contacted this life what are you bet that some neighbors called the FBI over the years on this bombing suspect I'm just going based on\nThe Vegas shooter the Parkland shooter the different mass shooters that have\nTaken place in the United states they all seem to have had consistent and persistent FBI contacts over the years I myself have never had FBI contacts well\nLet me rephrase that I have never had any one called the FBI on me that I'm aware of and been contacted by the FBI during an investigative capacity how 'bout that I've talked to the FBI to professional capacity or have other people is different\n\nSo I Am not I don't think I suspect in any mass shootings are bombings\nBut I just wonder\nRemember the Batman shooter FBI contacts Adam Lanza FBI contacts the guy a Parkland FBI contacts Vegas shooter FBI contact I'm just wondering I'm just wondering um\n\nOr

with\nPreexisting conditions done by the states were staged create the rituals and the federal government helps in each state and figure out what's best for their citizens I think that's a great way of doing it has said that two years ago matter of fact I actually further back than that [noise]\nSo now the uh there's going to be a border patrol agents can we talk about the troops and how they're gonna be able to get there and work with the border patrol and the two that they're going to use his executive order\nMr pretty it sounds like the the White House is considering an executive order a where the president uses his authority under section to twelve essentially to declare some migrants in eligible for asylum how\nThat work well the way it would it would work is if you look at the population that we're seeing a right now growing exponentially and very rapidly are a family units another company children primarily from um ah countries other than Mexico\nAnd specifically in the northern triangle et cetera what the law and onto the U.S [noise]\nUm if you see this population were actually looking at about sixty four percent of white apprehend says right now falling in this and that is a population and what\nHappens is we process them and then they get released into the communities as to remain here in our communities for three to five years before they see an immigration judge\nThe key point here is that once they see an immigration judge eighty percent or eighty percent or more are denied the asylum claims that they ... percent so\nIn in in very short explanation is that a lot of these people do not have\nThe the um the case for asylum be approved at the end of the process\nNow irrationally enough the a lot of folks they won as someone was Thirteen hundred now there are some it was over two thousand basically have turned around and going back home\nAnother two thousand Thirteen hundred two thousand are seeking asylum in Mexico\nWhich is kind of interesting proposition and then maybe they can try to come over some future point\nAll of the people that are being interviewed or saying I'm going for work opportunities and I hope they'll give us an opportunity to work and there's a visa program for that a migrant farm or work visa out there that you can get into\nAnd part of what is happening here is a norm as a matter of disinformation and again they had these organizers from these terror groups that are out there\nThat we are talking to the people\nWith a bullhorn talking to them and telling them\nWhat they need to be doing this time we're leaving a bright and early this morning 'cause they're those and be hot and they're starting to lose some people based on the temperature and they'll go in bum world should truck and get them just jump on Detroit as she tried to hitch a ride with them which I think it'd be kind of dangerous when you go to like fifty and sixty miles an hour\nSo we're gonna continue on with this border patrol a person is going to be talking about we need to turn them around\nNow we're being discriminated against Mexicans are to be honest I mean because it seems like central and south Americans are getting preference over Mexicans so we solve the Mexican illegal immigration issue we give a favoritism to Central American issues and all things back to two thousand two thousand nine if you guys\nEvery time we have a a a situation where we catch and release that embolden his that population that demographic to continue growing and growing I Will tell you that because of the practice\nOf where we do not have the ability to return these people to their home countries that has instigated this caravan to an extent people do not believe that we will return them back\nAnd we have to absolutely returning back um if they come this way and in the ... for the United states\nA champion when you look at the crowd can you hear out of ten twelve thousand ... four thousand us and its migrant camp and we don't know at this point exactly but when the Pentagon says they're going to send eight hundred troops down I'm sure it helpful but not enough\nWell yes we're seeing actually were seen about two thousand\nAh apprehensive day right now with all the uh care of and then my sector alone yesterday um or or the day before yesterday we apprehended well over a hundred people are and we're averaging very high numbers that's without the or the caravan\nSo as a cameraman starts moving in and we're already are preparing for we're planning with our inner agency partner with the local leaders with non government organizations we will manage the situation the key is that we are\nWe have to be able to return these people home or if we do not do that we will see more carbons\nAre going to think about those two thousand a day that's fourteen thousand a week the sixty thousand a month\nTo seven hundred and twenty thousand a year but the state of the constitution which it does it goes up of seasons and whether you've got planning and harvest type seasons that are out there that is a bunch I had no clue there was to come in over that right and they said to be coming over with kids and it seems that the kids are\nThe kinds of snatch the kids um sedentary Nielsen said that now they do a pregnancy test every female that comes over that that is a minor to say they got pregnant during the trip\nThat's incredible and they said she also said that they have they're having a problem with the scenario diseases to because the young girls are being I mean we're talking my kids are being taken advantage of here has absolutely sickening to listen to that last part of this\nMr pretty isn't the problem really the law I mean if you want to change the way it is Congress has got to do it and Republicans in Congress say hey look we've been trying to get something done for a while we've been trying to get some Democrats involved and they simply will not change so long with us absolutely\nWe have to give the men and women are the border patrol the tools that they need those two tools are a very simple one is we have the crews are close these immigration loopholes in order to be able to process these people and return them home\nThe second one is of course the or the personnel the technology and the infrastructure to include the wall system in areas where we need um um the ages are working twenty four hours a day doing the best that they can but at the end of the day we need those two things\nRight so the caravan is a public problem but there is a quiet problem that you deal with everyday eight hundred to a thousand apprehensions and some of them walk right up to you in turn themselves in and they're part of the process and the ones that can't get processed getting rankled bracelet which they break off and they never show up again\nIt's a cycle that you're seeing on a daily basis and it's up to Washington to fix it you could only do so much\n... that is exactly what's happening\n\nIs that um but I Know I Wish people would just do the right thing really is and I hope the house stays Republican because I Believe the Senate\nPeople like Jeff Flake and John McCain not being there will be a good thing that those two were in a a a border post say basically they wanted a big open border out there and so those two will not be around come January do shown any to report one\nWill be back right after that\nYou don't have one in our body or\nA\nNa\nNa na na\n\nNa\nNa na\nNa around me [noise]\nMaster control center says it W.

coming out in the early two thousand\nAh they really really prevalent and and it killed just overwhelmed them he committed my gosh I've never heard the story look it up and had them was gone and they leave it nearly two thousand and one or two thousand\nAnd two um but let's say that being that it as far as the as\nThey've got to get this under control they've got to stop trying to hide it and

his table church does so much damage out into the community because people will question their faith the question a lot of things about religion and in in a real bad way because you've got people who do bad things in the church\nWell and I stepped back from organized religion many years ago that doesn't mean that I left my right and that that's something that I think of the fighting we need to focus on our faith in our our beliefs versus on the organized\nReligion aspect of it where the all powerful and the almighty and our human being and not that spirit not only that they that is inside

step\nOf calling for the mission to resign\nSixteen years than church scandal in Boston that started all fought light if everybody remembers what do you think makes a difference in terms of what we've learned about ...\nWhat makes this one different is that we've got the\nWhistle blower inside\nWho is revealing this information and the information and it's it's hundreds and hundreds of pages of\nFemales personnel files which show\nTurks knew these activities were going on\nAnd took steps to address it but to\nIn her words cover it up and that's the dies his level to the\n... the bishop of

fact I'm I have a question or they're usually nuns around ... ... stuff like that or anything about the Catholic Church\nI Can't answer that question directly in my environment with the Catholic Church is I have been two kinds of churches that they were known knowns involved I'm Joe eager you better just because I don't know\nIt just seems that they would be with the blower or something like that and if it is it usually I'm now on now like yes that's now yes are there any south than non uh\nI'd never heard that I get kind of curious about that and the other question is you know I hate this caravan but not the fact that horrible and coming you know it just totally blew the story of Mexico\nAnd they they're um I don't know it had any yet they don't have anybody down there that I Know that that's another bad part of the care they just\nNot sure why it took away the story at the Nathan them at the American already here\nWell I can tell you one thing I uh I 'cause I Know in order to

this I Would be doing it more so to assure that this precedent doesn't affect\nA future American who might join a presidential campaign or anyone for that matter\nOkay so let's say ... to do let's say he loses\nThey say he wins as human and find out from this tic tac here this could be big 'cause he he gets down there it wouldn't work should\nIt was Israel\nTell me if I got this right you are\nTo help Israel prior to President Trump running for office to help Israel or do the best they can with his new oil discovery and you hook them up with Greek officials have tried to get a buyer for their oil and be able to actually write their energy that would put a red flag up to the Obama administration they didn't like you doing that\n[laughter] that's right I mean there's this misunderstanding that I was a sort of a Russia Insider I have absolutely no contact whatsoever in Russia I've never been to Russia I have no Russian friends um but I had a lot of contacts in the middle east and Israel and Egypt\nAnd uh what I really think this was all about is there was some sort of red flags that the Obama administration and possibly has the OJ pulled on me for my contacts and Israel if it was politically motivated I'm not sure it seems like that now given a certain information I learned a recently but uh that's really what this is all about\nSo wouldn't motion at oh there's Israel also your memory Netanyahu had aged election that was on there\nSo we can keep on going down here now is gonna be talking about the professor\nSo George Papadopoulos gets the attention of Donald Trump and he's he edge it to his foreign policy team unpaid position we didn't use missiles and hopefully get a job if he wins as fresh so you decide when\nDavid Cameron rips Donald Trump to write an editorial I say it's unfair to do that and all of a sudden the antennas go up with British Intelligence am I correct absolutely\nAs soon as I gave this it was an interview to the times of London I think ah around may first or second of two thousand six ten or ...\nIn supporting and you shouldn't be calling him an idiot or whatever he was doing about a Kennedy Trump's proposal for a Muslim ban which I think many people at the time in the United states were supportive of\nAnd as soon as I gave that interview that's one of my life completely turned upside down I was being followed in London\nI had a officials from the U.S embassy which are seemingly you see where intelligence officials reaching out to me Alexander down or want it to me and it was at that meeting with Alexander down or where he essentially he told me you better stopped bothering David Cameron and you better tell trying to stop bothering them to\nThink about this Jewish the embed the Australian and bass it or who by the way gave millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation is telling you to stop bothering David Cameron here in American who happens to be working unpaid for Donald Trump or Alexander daddy was talking to you both very proud of that you were talking a guy name when it's\nA trend I'm Joseph missed it yeah so it looks it and I I I think it's I Need to clarify who this person Joseph ... of this for the audience shows he reached out yet Joseph ... was the professor this multi is professor who dropped the information on me about the Russians have any Hillary Clinton's emails\nAnd he was the one that uh drew up the the thing on him and the\nRussia has he didn't ask for it I mentioned that I hold up a double as those by this because in the way he's describing it is this is true is is huge\nIs huge and it's continuing with the professor and gets as opposed to it was working for\nThe fire that can reached out team for what reason he wanted to talk to you about energy\nA yes or no we meet in Rome and I never quite understood exactly why I was meeting this person at a this University in Rome through my old company which I found out is this sort of a western intelligence up front group okay which I didn't know at the time so the entire a meeting with Joseph Smith said from beginning to an seems completely orchestrated\nAnd the most important fact is just a couple of days ago this man's lawyer one public unstated listen everyone this narrative about\nMy clients Joseph ... completely wrong he's not a Russian agent targeting Papadopoulos he was actually working at the behest of the FBI\nWhen he was talking with Papadopoulos when he was interacting with Papadopoulos now unless his lawyer is slandering his clients and he's a waiting a massive lawsuit for libel I'm not sure that he's lying\nTo severely comes up to you and he says I hear these Russians have Hillary Clinton's email ... listen to it okay if that was a downer comes up to a few days later is an email about Hillary Clinton's emails\nThat that's allegedly what happened I I don't remember ever talking ... about emails but let's assume that's what happened at this meeting\nIt seems completely a suspicious that a week or so after Joseph is a drops us information on me amongst elucidate unsolicited than Alexander donor apparently wants to figure out info on this particular topic it it just seems that it was some sort of a sting operation are gone bad to be quite honest with you\nIf it were is down or tape that conversation down or all of a sudden feels motivated in July of twenty ... twenty sixteen to call the FBI and say I'm really concerned I had this conversation with George Papadopoulos and they say really so they start following us are questioning the FBI questions you and then at what time they say you lied to us\nUh yeah so I didn't actually my first interview with FBI until January twenty Seventeen so it makes no sense out of Alexander down or had this information about me that I was some sort of a Russian conspiracy person why was I interviewed only in January of two thousand Seventeen when I met Alexander down in May of two thousand six ten and makes absolutely no sense\nOkay so from July and he's not interviewed into January after Trump is one\nBasically you know the balloon is listed said understand the Russians have emails own everybody's when that guy is a west unit set for the FBI nap or Russia\nOr the FBI as big boys and girls as big okay so now that it's just in in where he is so much has been under house arrest and the professor they was talking about is what he's missing\nYou wondering next thing you know the FBI is talking to you and you're basically under house arrest how did that feel\nUm I mean it's been very difficult because uh you know my livelihood is is a basically a ruined at this point in all my business was a based on traveling abroad and domestically I've traveled a lot of restrictions has been very difficult on my wife myself\nA you know we've gone through a lot and uh you know the most beautiful thing do out of this entire episode has been the American public support for me and my family out I'll never forget that and\nHow do you feel about President Trump I'm a big supporter of President Trump I think he's doing great things for this country\nAnd I never lost faith in the ... did they try to get you to flip on President Trump or I Can't really get into details of exactly what was going on with the FBI um but all I can say is I'm a firm supporter of President Trump and his agenda too with any Russian connections I have absolutely no Russia connections whatsoever unless you consider a think tank analysts and Russia\nA connection that I've never met and only three male and this multi is professor who apparently was working with FBI\nNow wonder hiding somewhere in Italy\n...\nSo\nBrian is going to ask this question who framed you and then it's going to get it into a conversation was a vice a war owning Papadopoulos\nTo frame ... I mean for the best you know you're not a detective\nThat I mean as I say there are all my contacts were completely in the middle east and Israel and particular in Europe I had actually know contacts in Russia just given that how on earth could a man like may be at the center of a rush of conspiracy unless I was completely framed\nBy western intelligence or to make it seem that Papadopoulos was interacting with Russians and that he's the Patsy that started this whole investigation do you feel like\nThis was a plot to unwind Donald Trump candidates and presidents and\nI I truly believe that uh it was likely some sort of a plot by a western intelligence to assure that if Kennedy Trump is elected remember this whole insurance policy that there would be up about ... precedents or some uh excuse to really try and squeeze them as ... as he's trying to squeeze now and do you\nBelieve that someone a sort of had a Pfizer warrant on you like they did Carter Page\nUm I don't have a real evidence yet about that but uh let's just say after my testimony yesterday I'm starting to believe that\nMore and more and more\nFascinating new shown any so he bought one checking them shouldn't

special events but Lucy was the dominant show the fifties yes what was the sixties gun smoke\nAnd it was dominant in by dominant they're like how many years where they number one in that decade Lucy and gun smoke in fifties sixties respectively were dominant number one for four seasons and then when you get to the seventies for five seasons in the seventies was all in the family and the eighties for five seasons that was The Cosby show\nAnd really in the mean well and then it's amazing to see where we are now with that I Know that that was an amazing show and you can't watch it anymore but in the nineties you think okay friends is dominant Ninety Seinfeld's dominant in the nineties or don't ...\nThe number one show in the nineties for five seasons sixty minutes\nYeah it's still around and now they're complaining because\nThe producer of the show got can for sexual or the other stuff going on the networks that are busy you know looking for this stuff with mine came and yeah but I never get in behind the scenes Moonves at CBS and this guy at sixty minutes so\nThey brought in some ancient producer from forty eight hours of the the cast members of sixty minutes or an open rebellion over this choice they don't have anything to do with their\nEars and the interesting stat or like American Idol and they all got eight seasons and was number one but its peak season household chair was only Seventeen point six that were as you go to I Love Lucy its peak season household chair sixty seven point three right but the trend has been down\nAnd share Tobar a member of viewers idle when I first came to Montgomery before the show started to go in to climb back in ...\nGet the ratings every week I've been getting them for years and it would routinely draw about thirty thirty five million viewers each night sometimes the the the voting rights would get lower numbers than the actual performance nights\nThat was the last show that has dominated like that in this country I don't

I Try but another story that made me you know suck on my bike and go ... interesting interesting the SPA\nAs now due to a few trials in a few companies pushing for it they're not considering suicide is found in magical mushrooms as quote unquote breakthroughs therapy\nI posted this yesterday and here's the thing whenever you see a story like this this is the federal Drug Administration\nThe FDA ... food and Drug Administration they're saying civil Simon as found in ...\nIt's the street lingo goes or allowing for break through therapy and treating people's depression it's fascinating stuff it really and we're not talking here I'll see how some people reacted gentleman named Kevin Potter Kevin thank you for commenting\nHe said wait so a quote unquote natural drugs it makes you hallucinate and not know where you are is okay but the FDA but pot is not\nStarted to read the story but got lost in all the science talk on the sun stocks important Kevin Fair enough so don't jump on my back side but true or not good and I tried to tell them that it it's\nAnd what Kevin doesn't seem to understand is it's not that the FDA and these companies are not recommending people like top sill aside and capture goals for you know the way they ... or ... rose ac for depression\nOr whatever the pro was one that was around for a while\nWhat they're doing is essentially in a controlled environment with the therapist giving people certain doses of suicide\nWhatever's troubling them and then several months later after maybe a couple of these therapy sessions with the dosage these people are having major breakthroughs no longer depressed\nIn particular the people are having the biggest breakthroughs in these trials are people that are diagnosed with terminal illnesses like a terrible cancer diagnosis and Neal that's a very difficult thing to face a lot of people go through anger and denial and sometimes you don't handle it and it's a very bitter in\nThey're giving they're allowing those people to do through these trials and taking a dose of suicide in and talked to a therapist talked to a specialist and they're getting over that fear and that depression that comes with say like facing death that's the most serious thing\nWhen other people a diversion for all sorts of reasons sometimes how they're wired\nAnd the best I can guess is that it allows you to get out of those patterns are habits of thinking that if you're talking to ... and let me be clear folks it's not like you're going and finding finding some mushrooms out\nIn a field in a ... and like popping them and having fun with for it right and smoke a little wacky back you know that's not what we're talking about and that's\nThat's such a problem with our mentality about drugs\nAs like certain drugs are only party drugs man like marijuana and alcohol and cocaine and Froome an acid grow in India may and like all this stuff\nAnd then they because they're illegal they've grown up in the culture in the party scene and an illegal space whereas all sorts of other drugs some less harmful some more harmful are in a medical since they've been in a medical space they've been studied have been research they're prescribed by doctors\nAnd in this country we for some reason to have\nAll the ones that the government decided in the late sixties and seventies are forbidden yeah are always bad and the ones that they allowed for medical research somehow slip through the cracks\nOr is that those are five and so I think what's happening is number one it's come down with India may it's helping people was P. T. as in the\nCivil aside when we're now seeing major breakthroughs and these aren't just bumped studies like these are studies being done at Johns Hopkins like Institute juries are these are major breakthrough studies and I I'm not saying that oh we should be able to\nI mean my ideal position as you should be able to put in your body what you please right\nI mean why should you have to if you've got what is deemed terminal cancer I Know a man that live for over ten years he was supposed to be dead\nAnd what did he do he went to Mexico to get treatment yeah because it was things that were not approved by the FDA right and I don't want anything to be sold as this is the I mean you go back to the ... of\nThe wild wild west when the gadget drove up with all their stuff like the alcohol the day and uh the dietary supplements world supplements world with like protein and fry or like neutrophils reading the article on that and there's all sorts of stuff out there that claims it'll give you more\nEnergy and focus and memory and just ... mental clarity\nAnd they're really expensive and I think a lot of it's a snake oil or a lot of it might just worked for only a few people and their physiology that's right but the ones that it does work four letter word for word but here's the thing at the end of the day they don't want skin to really help your mind\nMake you feel better even if you're depressed and this isn't a catch all\nBut you know exercise some during the day do for a walk at least it's amazing how will free up your body to feel better and you're\nPlace good habits with a pill that dry common sense yeah but I also I think this mentality we inherited from also especially conservatives out there this mentality is that of the progressive side of the early Nineteen hundreds all the way into the sixties and seventies Richard Nixon was a progressive Republican\nBrought us I think the PA and many other instance institutions that I don't think of serve the public very well sure and so why are we carrying on this progressive holier than thou mentality because it's to save people from hurting themselves\nIt's we're doing this for your own good mentality I think on the end and the good intentions were climbing there are also some other drug companies or who would love to see certain things I Love and have alcohol industry isn't happy that marijuana's becoming\nAnd how powerful are that way and that's where it always you know it always comes down to where the money is do do the pharmaceutical companies\nOne of the wealthiest as a group organizations in this country did they won't alternative medicine no it's a simple story when you bumped your head that night and you said that that stuff that that law and gave me and put it on your head moisturizer\nYou know what his label that way because they cannot cited as an antibacterial because it had been tested by the FDA that's what it was okay but you can sell that there's more stress on it did my did have a quick healing and you have no scar and everything looks perfect woman I think you've or patting that on my head but that's\nThe way things go and uh and there's so much money and you know the alcohol industry you know that lobby has legalized marijuana think\nAbout the studies right now with civil aside and found a magical Oxford and all these companies producing the helping people with anti depression just getting rid of depression all these pills that are being produced an anxiety ... they're not happy that\nA few therapy sessions with very limited doses of a natural chemical\nMeans you don't have to buy Xanax income see them every ... every month yeah so that's a major breakthrough for people\nNot for those companies making millions and millions of dollars here's the thing we shouldn't have a system where they are trained in their favor which it currently is it cost billions of dollars yes billions with a B\nTo bring drugs the market because of our approval process at the FDA it's absurd right how long it takes if anything right now what they do is they test for safety but also effectiveness\nAnd you have to do all sorts of litigation to show the effect of us know if it's safe let people test the effectiveness\nAnd it just it drives me nuts but also at the end of the day it all the ... it makes sense to me that natural is better now\nYou can look back and go okay why is it that people you know hundreds of years ago her eating all natural we're doing as well because you have to be eating natural but also be smart as a best way to prepare natural stuff\nBut it doesn't surprise me that when you go back to just eating good food like I did this myself\nI stopped eating fast food I'll have a ... day here their bus stopped eating fast food every night I stopped eating processed sugars and processed white bread and that sort of stuff I wouldn't that just\nStraight meat best meat I confide best fish I can find I mean occasionally I have now gotten an appetite for greens I never used to agree to I used to hate that stuff now I'll eat a simple cell or some green beans or something\nOr they they have a different understanding than I Do sometimes it is it says that no man\nKnows the heart except for God Arabs people say that well don't judge or the people because you don't know what's in their heart I think it goes deeper than that ... to you don't even know in your own horn ill ... make it a good point oh my God\nMaking a man to the point it's a something as they all the time the tire earning years a tyrant in me yeah and that we it's another like you know when you see a guy who's rich and famous like ... stand up special ... years ago like Tiger Woods\nLike some guy like a forklift operator you know good honest living\nIs criticizing Tiger Woods or one of these big fat bladder mouse on Fox News is talking about oh how ... what Tiger Woods did\nYou don't know what it's like to be in his shoes yeah he's making millions of dollars every where he turns some woman is thrown herself into now what should have done in that situation don't get married if you're going to given to the temptation or get married and stay true to your wife\nYou have choices here but all the people criticizing him near ... it's back to what we're making earlier it's easy for somebody on the outside looking in to make a kind of a cold rational decision or calculation of how should somebody behave in a situation\nLike obviously if you're married men stayed true to your wife tiger if you don't want to be marry more get divorced tiger and do it quietly but don't you know but I'm not in his shoes I don't know what it's emotionally light to constantly be tempted\nOr this week if I had one that mega millions jackpot is essentially a billion dollar pay out there's no telling what I Would have done it I Would have been I actually would have had a bit of fear\nIn all running through me because who knows what that type of money especially when you don't earn it you don't create it you get lucky like a lottery I mean I Would like to think I Would immediately run all sorts of tax professionals attorneys\nFinancial planners I Would put a lot a way to start building more of a nest egg\nOr I Would have fun and the charity charities space like set up a foundation don't just give you other charities but\nThat's always a fun idea like if you really go into a lot of money what sort of things would you do for others like generally do in a charitable sense that's a fun idea the come up with I'm not certain what I Would do one thing that does fascinate me though is maybe talking to people especially young people\nWho get into politics and they start to take it really seriously because especially any donuts or have to be young it could be any age\nBut when you first find an idea when it's ... there's a novelty to an idea you're just a rookie politician it Ricky politician or like a rookie fan of politics 'cause I Know some people like this to go through their whole life\nAnd they don't vote they don't really ever pay attention to the news and then say comes around like they're thirty something they're forty something and they're starting to take politics more seriously and watch the news and they sort of grasp on to an idea and I'm almost done the opposite I started out really young watching the news and being into politics and I'm sort of\nJaded in that sense\nAnd what I Would tell people especially new to politics especially when the heat of an election mid term or presidential is the novelty wears off\nAnd don't take yourself so seriously whatever your ideology that nobody else can take you seriously and certainly don't take yourself so seriously that you are destroying friendships that you are destroying\nRelationships within the family that you are now feeling like there's always the enemy out there and I know our rhetoric sometimes sounds like that from both sides it sounds like that\nAnd they are there are people out there that no doubt folks are just pissed me off to no end I don't want to really have to deal with them but\nEspecially when you're new to politics there's something about it that that gets rolled up it gives you hope and promise and make you feel empowered yeah our calls is good when we're on the side of the angels now let's take on the devils\nAnd let's see the day out and feels despairing when your side loses how could we lose\nBut if you step back and you have some perspective it will allow you not to make emotional decisions and actually you know you don't have to feel as though\nYou're or side was represented by the stupid bomber even though he was wearing your team's colors and and I had all those stupid stickers doesn't mean you have to identify with them I think that's the number one problem these days there's too much collective pride in collective guilt and collective shaming ...\nThere is and it hurt so bad the way that the ... and I'm Sorry and maybe maybe I'm looking through my Republican cover ... but the way that the media portrays these things and uh I was saying earlier or you know a guy\nScreaming ally ... bar drives through a crowd and kills eighty people and they have no clue what the motivation good\nUh was seen in a red hat so obviously Donald Trump told him to go out here and do all this stuff or you know and it's it's frustrating that every single news outlet will run with that I mean we talked about it the bright he's the mega bomber\nThe ... part ... why would you call him that who goes he was he loved Donald Trump yeah\nHe was also little nuts I mean it just you know people that love may have done some stupid things ... you know exactly driven drunk and and and kill people and things like that does that make them the ... or\nKiller or dryer you have\nThat role and it's just it's taking things too far taking things too seriously and we've seen this in sports to people take things too seriously I'm sure some and it gets killed somebody over like at Auburn, Alabama game oh sure I'm sure that it's up and all sorts of fights happen or things as stupid as\nWe're winning a championship or lose it\nAnd people just get emotional and their whole identity in like tied up into this one moment and you know what there is an incredible thing link right now folks southern world is watching his daughter\nPlay volleyball\nAnd he is so emotionally invested in\nThe ... and it's not just my daughter is a whole team I mean they're they're they're a group you got you got nanny\nGot nicknames for all the folks we get\nRe nanny three four\nBig daddy and\nThe corals out there right now ...\nAnd I just came from seven to for they are now up nine to set up and\nWell\nAnd this is for this is for the championship fish yeah OK the silver bracket championship at nationals and if they lose what are you going into your your daughter it depends on how the pie I don't\nHave to I've I've raised my young and and that's what's what's funny is I I don't really have to get on to my girl they know in a row and when they want they don't win\nAnd Lauren she's the you know she's in archery she's like good job girls good job girls ... and and especially nanny nanny a look at me and she'll put her eyes down a shift shake your head and I'll raise my eyebrows\nAnd show just mail the word she says I suck that game and I'm like yeah you really did ... did you see\nThat sir hit square into the middle of the net I'm like yeah I think it just like I don't hit the ball and then they say I Know\nSome I don't even have to correct them\nThan there is a beautiful thing about like sport where does keep you accountable like there's not too much about proceeding sports everyone's gotta by by the same rules or you're called out for and usually whatever you'd that doesn't count like cheat\nYou ah you know you're called out for and I had I was talking last night was the Dr Stephen Miller about how usually a traditional bad guy you if you want to be considered a bad guy you lie cheat and steal\nEddie Guerrero when he did as a Latino heat run\nIn the WWF on WWE or if he was explicitly say I love I cheat and steal and it worked very well like people hated them but in the way you kind of want people age not just for one night where they turn off the channel\nBut they constantly come back oh I Hope that guy loses because he lies cheat and steal so much right when I'm having a little bit of trouble here because usually\nThe person or lie cheat and steal says the bad guy but southern would yes\nFor movies is a cast of characters\nThat lie cheat and steal explicitly and I love the ocean's eleven yes\nThat is a great idea of you lie and why is it I don't know what is it a belt and the interesting thing I all day every day will say there should be laws against theft it should be illegal to steal one dollar let alone millions of dollars I",
