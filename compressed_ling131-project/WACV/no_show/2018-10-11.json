going to hear some good news about your money\nNow here's your house my count of financial victory\nBaker who's always got to know\nWhat the man who convinced when I was gonna quit selling fried chicken and go into the candy business it's David iron is yes and he went into the candy business and he said David days twenty two\nAnd I said why is that he said because now I Can't walk on it with my shoe\nI guess well sticks like glue that yeah yeah well yeah and you know it'd be bad to have all that fried chicken and the ... get the harder it is now because the ledge twenty two yeah well and you know we we did come up with a with a a a way to explain that a catch twenty two\nIs like when you just starting out and you go down here to company X Y Z and you want a job and they look you over so well you're fine looking you know ma'am but we just can't hire you because you got no experience and you're twenty two years old uh-huh and then they say you say well how ... getting experience if I don't have a job\nThat I didn't catch twenty two and of course there was a there was a movie yeah\nAnd uh the the the whole thing in in that movie he was trying to get out of a ... billion in the army oh it was a he was out on they they they weren't in a combat zone they were out on this island near every year but he didn't want to show up to the to to get shot at so I don't remember I remember going into big crazy\nYeah what do you run into catch twenty two every day there's always a cat here when I turn on red you know that kind of always a catch twenty two you know uh\nThese are difficult circumstance from which there is no escaping get out because a mutually conflicting are dependent can dish recall a trip without the trap why can't get out ... because maybe your lover too much baby I guess so yeah so\nOh that's another story [laughter] another show thank you very much are so far ... so catch twenty two ah\nIt's ... it's a paradox because you've got contradictory things going on and supposedly the term was coined by Joseph Heller H. E. L. L. E. R. mhm who used it it is Nineteen sixty one novel catch twenty two\nAh\nAn example and I'm reading this is how am I supposed to gain experience to fight and you just said yeah a good job if I'm costs would turn them but I have any\nQuestion how do you get it how do you get out of your dilemma so to speak and there's a lot of people that are in dilemmas out there mhm during catch twenty two years they they work\nThey don't say they don't save because do one helps them save\nA they don't say because they married to an unsafe or they don't save cause they don't have enough left over to say ... they don't say because they had to put the children first they don't save but calls this that whatever something always in the way\nThey don't save but the catch twenty two is is if you don't save who's going to take care of you\nCatch twenty two that's right because of the time my come when there's nobody left to take care of catch twenty two and you\nYou won't you won't have something to leave when you go but if you know if there's nobody there to take\nCare of you\nKnow the government gets your money and yet nothing left to leave\nCatch twenty two exactly here's another catch twenty two now how many twenty two year olds are going to be interested\nRetire with Ernest dot com logging on Facebook at health and wealth with David earnest and while you're there you'll find a link to David YouTube channel where we've archived a lot of our older programs and there's some funny comedy stuff there for your amusement as well now I'd like to mention our new sponsor ads\nRestaurant where we treat you like family skis Lincoln I get a little more team plays out get at yourself I'm\nBusy say okay well maybe it's like the math and family I don't know\nBut here's David iron is [noise]\nThank you rusty a free shake that so much oh yeah\nYou always make me feel real good glad to do it you know and and speaking of a real good and fun we're going to do something pretty fun here pretty soon this we are all understand we're going to be talking about it on the ah the website and Facebook page and it's just going to be big do and so we want to talk about it in an hour just tell you well you\nKnow a we'll ... we'll\nJust say this because it's going to be an annual event any way or we're going to have a annual Christmas Party probably in here and so just be looking on our Web sites\nAre and uh for those dates mhm and and where it's going to be because they will be an annual thing that we will do this and\nAnd you will everybody will have on like and funding a little elf hats and you know will be given a\nCandy canes ... Christmas tree mia yeah we'll we'll we'll we'll have a lot of fun and we and we're going to bring some people are in that people thought were not here anymore in the [noise] and we're going to have some fun with him\nAt this going to be something to see so stay tuned as they say they too and uh one one real quick thing I just want to mention\nTo seven nine seven four three wars we mentioned the number a lot because we want you to call\n'em now somebody that I talked to actually calls you and you're working something with them now by\nAnd are odd I'll tell I'll tell a lot of folks that I that I Know that uh I Know David and if they've got Doctorow four one K. laying around in there or do it well you you don't do anything call David delivered and tell you what the best thing to do would be\nAnd um you know it's as simple as that just to take you take this thing or you can't see it but this one right here and you are well known not that thank you take this ... and you just start punch in the bus to seven nine seven four three one and I think I think that goes right to uh to your answering absolutely right\nAnd left and you check it I'll check it frequently and All right back so you have to seven nine seven four three want plus I get a nickle for every time he calls\nSo hand whenever we do have events they will be on the answering machine too there you go yeah so if you're if you're inquisitive about what event we're going to have and what ever go to the website or go to the answering machine and or should I call my number and you will get information\nAs to what is planning the dates and things like\nSeven or seven for three one [noise] so we're talking about catch twenty two mhm that's like\nFar and the firemen are standing down there you can't get downstairs who's bailed is on fire over a five or six lowest farm under down ever that big old find to catch in ... when you look down you see it split down the middle ... no matter what you do you go get bombed up a little bit\nYou're in a catch twenty you are in a catch twenty two what do what do you want to lose or you can fly\nIs you might have been avoided a lot of a catch twenty two if you're prepared fry a you won't be in the catch twenty two\nYou can't get out of all your catch twenty two is not not ever said that you could ask a catch twenty two and itself as a quick catch ... if that's the sub a sub article cash ... sub catch twenty two twenty to twenty two ah\nAh one of those dimensional things ... but\nSo the thing is you can always pre planned for things that could hit you if you know that they could hit you and the probabilities of I'll give you an example mhm what's the probability that you will need to have a retirement plan oh I Would say a hundred percent\nOkay what's the probability that you'll need long term care plan of the ... I Would just going to say pretty close\nTo a hundred percent if not a hundred percent in a family is Seventy percent chance why an individual's forty percent of all what's the chances that your house would burn down it fifty one no\nOne to two percent although I was talking to an insurance guy the other day and say that they say it's actually six percent but\nI don't know two percent or six percent not near as much as the Saturday or a hundred percent chance\nOnce the chances that you will leave this world someday oh a unless you know something a hundred percent value go these are things that would make sense for you not to leave your family or you can catch twenty two don't you think I think so\nSo the thing that you're going to be able to avoid these catch twenty two situations these paradoxes ... that you can't get out of buzzwords this is going to hurt over here it is well I'll give you that example you've ever been to the dentist\nYes go quite frequently hedge twenty two yeah you got a real bad real bad to think yeah and he said this is going to hurt to get this thing out of here\nBut when I get it out it won't hurt anymore it'll could hurt adequate hurt but it's going to be extreme pain\nSo you've heard of that term bite the bullet uh-huh and you go ahead and let him pull it out Russ how broke the tooth I was ... and the bullet and [laughter] and then I shouldn't have been no SARS oh\nShould you be bite the bullet right now for the catch twenty two that's come in the huge headache the big to say it's going to come in the future if you didn't get ready for\nLong term care if you didn't get ready for retirement if you didn't get ready for your hair cut me cut your hair to get cut in you've got to long hair and then\nThere you go well you know and it's something we had mentioned in a while was that the grasshopper and an old member that you had to do\nOver grasshoppers actor playing chewing tobacco and not do end up sitting round is watching everybody else is over errors that little an aunt just work in a way as his summertime it it might have gone fishing and and having a good time but this little lion he's put in a way for the winter he's he's looking out for the future\nHe's looking for his voted ... twenty two\nAnd the next thing you know winters here the grasshoppers out in the cold I ain't got no groceries ain't got no place to stay in the aunt is all and his little ant house over there and he's he's taken care of he's he's he's got stuff loaded\nAnd I guess it helps him out you know it was just like for the sake of argument that he did help him out but the thing is when it got summer again the grasshoppers out there playing he's not putting up here for the winter or as you say more of the story is some folks never learn\nFrom people just don't get it and some people just get it in the ... and\n[laughter] that would be there about that you're talking about [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] and we saw that on cannonball run it and [laughter] you know what you [laughter] you know what I call the ... just in Jamaica don't you why is that a ... [laughter]\nIf you don't want to get poked in you know yeah yeah you know joke either yeah you don't want to get poked in broken now that break you know or you're yoke or you\nThat's all folks [laughter] yeah you need to call David or has he will show you how to be a good aunt and if you're a grasshopper he could teach you what you need to do so you don't have to depend on them because that I might get you know aggravated and just cut you off\nYou know I've seen that\nI've seen them where people come in and talk to me as I say I say are you going to get a hair it's one of the questions we ask 'cause you know how much money guy how much you're going to make and what she plans ... are you going to get it in here\nAnd I've had people say yeah I've got this and I'm the only nephew ... and this this ... this rich uncle is going to leave me\nBlah blah blah so\nYour time huh mhm rich and rich uncle and they come in and say David\nI Am so I'm so sad what happened I did not know this but rich uncle rich and they had another play ... took it will\nI took it was they gave it to someone else I Believe they are not one came in and said\nThat their grandmother was so mad if their mother back\nThe money that they were going to use for their college education they give to an orphanage instead sending the arguments to college they sent some body they didn't even know\nThe college and let go of their own blood ... must have been may they were the point I'm trying to make as you can always get the catch twenty two ... don't don't be\nCounting your legs before they hatch and don't be counting somebody else's eggs because you don't even know if they're going to happen for you\nIs is that correct some in what your thoughts on the\nWell my thoughts are this that probably could officials and and I I'm not a perfect public visual but I think we all ought to set\nAn example of civility and so for a senator say get in their face for congresswoman like her to see getting your face and then what happens is uh the president's press secretaries and Senator Cruz or pushed out of restaurants\nThat are surely that is encouraged by what are these congresswoman and senators are saying and it was wrong\nOr I Believe in a freedom of association freedom of speech freedom to demonstrate butter ought to be peace hall and you shouldn't do anything that's going to encourage violence because even if or congresswoman doesn't intend violence\nThere's some people that are going to take it one step further than she intended\nAnd she needed to back off about ... steps and a and not\nSurely not be in your face if you're going to have a democratic\nAnd representative government function properly uh I got to be a few feet away we got to have a a discussion a dialogue I got to have respect for people that disagree with me and she ought to respect for people that disagree with our\nBut in your face is in a way to do it\nWell she said a year ago that\nShe was going to take Donald Trump out\nA and what does that mean I mean she sent this I'm lesbian or gay algae Beatty dinner and she goes in and take him out\nThat she wasn't saying take 'em out for dinner and she was like take him out and telling people that are getting harassed and restaurants and it seems like that that message really has terminated the permanent protest a\nMentality in the Democratic party senator and and my concern is that someone's going to end up getting hurt we already had Steve ... shot you would've thought that the the the Democrats would have calmed everyone down after that\nBut when you have Susan Collins been cornered in an elevator it's one thing when Jeff Flake is cornered an elevator but then you pour all Susan Collins and people being ... its screamed at a centimeter from their face while they're trying to walk down a hallway I mean what can be done about this\nWell ah obviously for those of us that are in public office and in in public places and we're confronted with that and they're doing it under what they think is\nPolice protection for five hundred and thirty five members of Congress every place so yours spreads throughout the United states even relying upon a local police or you can't do that as well so are are are\nI've come to the conclusion and this repetitive of whatever kind of already said to you but our\nDemocracy will be a stronger a whiz respectful political discourse as opposed to what is happening or when you go on called get in their face\nWell what what senator what responsibility does something like a Dianne Feinstein or Cory Booker or\nKamala Harris have to to speak against this type of\nHarassment and intimidation this isn't just carrying assigning and chanting some things is is cornering more women in elevators this this is something and we have\nWe have people threatening to kill cabinet are teachers and Minnesota I mean people are taking this all the hard if you if you say someone's like a combination of not seeing a sexual predator enough times\nSome way I could do it all is going to you know take take matters into his or her own hands got help but so what responsibility does the Democrat leadership have here\nUh I don't think they're going to exercise but they gotta they\nGotta responsibilities Reno ...\nNo I Would I Would I'm waiting for that ah I'm waiting for that undergrad there go ahead and wait a long time ago [laughter] Senator Grassley ah\nThe lessons learned from this Kavanaugh saga\nOf many of us thought that in the beginning when we had to put off the hearing and and kick it off from the Thursday vote initially kick it off to Monday and then I got delayed because of the Ford allegation\nAnd any thoughts to solidifying the rules so you can't extend hearings past the closer the original herring date so these kind of anonymous allegations can't drop and make a difference again [noise]\nWhoa I read your\nQueen ... when you took me to tears called me for for not on a horrible but you can't you can't you can't use if I call the vote today you want to we went along\nWe weren't all yeah tend to tend to rely on and so you got to have some respect for people that are on the job here are doing it and so we we waited until we had the votes\nNow now I corrected myself after that I didn't delete the ... because I set it on but I corrected myself and I you and you and McConnell\nBoth hands are handled this master play in the face of incredibly difficult and I think I'm a\nI'm a highly emotional highly charged atmosphere and when people say that Dr Ford was disrespected which is a guest on my show said last night she was disrespected I said\nOh my gosh Senator Grassley said if you need something repeated or you know if you are you okay do you need anything I mean you couldn't have been more solicit is of Dr Ford I I Can't imagine how you could have been frankly\nYeah [noise] well it reminds me of how I was confronted by Iowans because ah in the Thomas hearings because I was going to need a hill and I never ask a single question but I was sitting beside specter that did are questioning and everybody thought I was factor [laughter]\nOh\nGoodness the Senator Grassley a there was another moment that I have\nTo get you to react to um [noise] this is Heidi Heitkamp of course Democrat North Dakota undecided divide vote against Kavanaugh a lot of people have talked about whether the court remains legitimate you heard Hillary say that it's a shame that things happen as they happen because the court always was respected\nAnd this is what senator hide camps that you're obviously in the midst of a very tough\nYou feel voting the way you did was the right way do you worry are you concerned that it may have cost you your sinuses at the end of the day still have to look at yourself in the mirror and think about what your future holds compromise something like this\nBased on politics and I I Believe the U.S or what have compromised um my true belief that um this person's um did not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court\nThey're still repeating that temperament issues Senator Grassley\n[noise] he lives and this gets back to what I already told you got twelve successful years on the DC circuit the second most important in\nA court in the land he's been collegial or even people like Garland a said that he had that sort of a approach to judging and that means judicial temperament and not only are you have a personality that is a temperate\nYou also leave your personal views out of\nOut of a decision making you look at the law and look at the uh uh get facts of the case and just to use those two things to go by\nSo consequently uh ... what what she said Sandra Hi Kim said plus your question brings me to a history of Thomas\nAh is it going to hurt the Supreme Court I listen to the same thing twenty eight years ago and then I look at twenty eight years record\nOf Thomas on the court and I've never seen any retribution on his part towards anything that was that against him at that time and he was mad when he said he was going through our high tech and say Hi\nTo ... yeah ...\nYeah so so ah you know after twenty eight years or listen to the same thing about Thomas not seeing it I think that I got great confidence that Kavanaugh's going to bring great press stage and knowledge and academic background\nAnd more importantly his work\nOn the second highest court ... court and it's all positive\nNo it's it's one of the most qualified people period of time to sit on the foreign\nSenator Grassley the uh the Susan Collins um situation main course all these leftist billionaires promising to flood\nOr the her opponent whoever that ends up being a with lots of money you want to raise three million dollars for Susan Collins I Know Mitch McConnell has said the same thing how was that looking\nWell we're just getting started at that\nBut a conservative even though a lot of times they disagree with Susan Collins they gotta look at her as a senator of great principal\nAnd we need to respect that and I said three million it's going to take a lot more than three million de liked her but they raised ... million against or so our goal is three million dollars right now and everybody that real ought to respect her and want cabin on on the

a Trump flying with all Rosenstein or the other day down to where the heck with a sign of Florida yeah and I saw rod at the White House at the cabinet thing and I said when you drink some pick the dust on the president what he's suddenly your best friend's wedding what's a theory there congressman\nUh I I don't know but I don't know the facts are facts and then you have to give it the case that most that we used to peanut\nThere are all these stories out earlier this week that talk about how serious they took the alleged comments Mr ... died about actually recording the president in the oval office wearing a wire or tape recording in whatever they were or a phone recording whenever they were going to do um\nEntered the fact that it now looks like Mr August I'm not going to show up tomorrow so we don't do that for sure but we're starting to hear rumors that he's not coming to talk to Congress like he was supposed to uh tomorrow and I'm In the Judiciary Committee Phil\nMay mean thank God because he has a good relationship with the president now he doesn't have to\nMaybe maybe or maybe it has something to do with the story that were written\nStories and said he said the ... and this ... ... talk to Mr Baker so a book or a or hopefully hopefully he'll take change his mind that will be there tomorrow so we can ask the questions that I think American people deserve to have the answers to\nCongressman joined explain James Baker the uh the man who is the attorney at the FBI and why his involvement and all of this and his contacts are so important to the narrative of how this whole Russian investigation was started\n'cause he's the chief counsel when you're the chief counsel the FBI and you're the guy in the middle of the two biggest investigations ruined by all these key players struck page McCabe call me um\nThat is important and when it's now now being reported that uh he was he talked to both McCain and paid shortly after this meeting took place with Mr Rosenstein and that he understood it to be a serious comment made in that meeting that's why we need to talk to Mr Rosenstein I never forget the fundamental facts\nWhen have you ever seen this happen at any federal agency James Comey fire director former direct FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe light three times under oath fire Jim Baker chief counsel first demoted then left the FBI we used to page FBI council demoted then left and of course Peter Falk\nThe counter intelligence demoted then fired top people the FBI demoted or fired\nAll the people who ran the Clinton investigation and then now as we know launched and ran the Russia investigation until Mr Rosenstein named Mr Mahler to take a destination over her ... important ... needs to be in front of us so we can asking questions about all\nYeah he's not going to shop there's no way I don't think you know I had mine for your either\nNo no he's not gonna he's not going to come I I just I I guess I don't understand why that he they claimed it was a joke\nAnd it maybe I just don't have the sense of humor I really thought I had but I don't think that was all that funny like I'm going to wire myself or get wired going tape to president and then get the twenty Fifth Amendment go I I don't understand why is that funny\nI agree with you I agree with you completely Laura you shouldn't be joking about it about matters like that in front of the ordinance mean that is that this is the guy who in effect is running the Justice Department and whether it sarcasm or joke or what it should not be set\nUp particularly remember the time that this was done this was when the whole stinking town was all spawn all this is between may ninth twenty Seventeen and may seventeenth twenty Seventeen late night the debate Bernstein writes the memo that the president uses to fire Comey may seventeenth is when Rosenstein names\nBob Mueller as special counsel sometime in between there and it looks like it happened on may six tape is one of his alleged conversation took place so even joking about something in that timeframe when that whole city was all spun up about all the special counsel and obstruction of justice and altered issues that all the more reason why you should not be saying something even if it was a joke\n... again the the main question that is on the table I think 'cause my mother's gonna do among there's going to do but the main question on the table is why did you serve veil an American citizen\nBased on information you received from and paid for from the opponent of Donald Trump\n... now you can you can start surveilling someone because they traveled to Russia and said hello to a a government official at some point and years ago you he was questioned and\nCarter Page mean where does he go to get you know his reputation back in ... where did she go to get his legal fees paid I mean he's just twisted when for years\nI'm a I'm a ... it's good you brought that up because we sometimes it's important is to go back to basics the Clinton campaign the DNC paid curtains carried off or who paid fusion GPS\nSince and put together a document that was completely false totally bogus totally on corroborated in that document became the basis are going to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on Mr page because he was associated with the other parties can paint that is what happened here and ... and they used the press\nTo get all kinds of information flooding the FBI so so fusion GPS is a newly ... works for them she gave information to her husband's within funneled into the FBI so she gets information to resort to Justice Department official so you've got all these sources sending the lie\nTo the FBI which gives it more credibility always say the more people talking about the live easier to lie is to believe and that's exactly what took place you are but it's still a lie\nAnd they use that to go to spy on the other camp it's\nWhat's wrong with the um what's your what's your sense about um the mid term elections I mean do you think Kavanaugh the energy from that is going to sustain the Republicans to cut maybe some of the Democratic gains that there are still predicting in the house a well how do you see this playing out\nYeah I Hope so I Hope so I was I was in or out and about across our district and lived in Florida the other night when people were fired up that that are sent it helps ...\nAnd a and confirmed a good manager was being attacked by the last I think a lot of people are beginning to see that the left has gone completely crazy we did a tweet the other day had more people comment on that we said today's last a plot tapper Nick destroy Kavanaugh and\nThat's today's left ... they they embrace the radical you know ... when he respects the flag embrace Cuomo when he says\nAmerica was never that great cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed people who support the president or an old by the way will destroy cabin on the positive I mean that's today's left and I think it is beginning to fire up conservative voters are Republican voters I Hope it is staying over the next twenty six days and that we can keep the majority now\nDo you look over your shoulder more now with ah with what's happening out there [noise] yeah\nI mean I think you have to uh I I don't know if I started at the law but my ... where we're at a back in June literally two days after Maxine Waters did her first rant and we got what I what I call the treatment from a lady were out and she started we're in a line of people moving into the theater and\nUm she just started ... you know yelling shame and evil and Jim Jordan terrible all this stuff so I mean it's ridiculous we we would never do that the people who are on the left\nBut they seem to want to do that all the time now so you do kind of just watch a little bit armed [noise] you know um look I Wish they wouldn't do that I don't think it's appropriate but despite about and argue about the idea is let's not let's not make it personal let's not wrong people out to restaurants and do all the things that they're\nThat they're going to do that they found to do it and it's safe with its it's what they have now they're holding on to the anger by the way there was an interesting thing actually I forgot to ask you earlier congressman\nAndy McCarthy the former um since the U.S attorney in southern district of New York he made this point on my show last night about Rosenstein and why the president may not end up ah removing him as deputy age he lets listen\nI think the president realizes that if he were to get rid of a Rosenstein at this point it would be like firing Comey times three and it would give mall or a reason to extend the investigation why what do you want to do that I mean it looks like now\nThere's not going to be any charges they're staffing down they've transitioned a lot of these cases that they brought to other components of the Justice Department this is about or\nWhat do you think about that yeah I mean I I it seems like things are pretty quiet some they must be writing the report Korea\nYeah I I Hope so and I think that's that's probably a ... that can be right and I obviously respect or Mr McCarthy I'm and all the things he's written about always done so I look I don't there's going to be any changes made the Justice Department until after the election until after Bob ...\nThe president wants that a new attorney general and um I think that that will happen at some point too but I don't think that's going to happen until after the election of until after the special counsel's work just finished\nA Jim Jordan always great to talk to Congress set of Ohio congressman thanks so much will take a break close out this

AAA\nEight to five five to Tucson\nFor many years ago I discovered that there are thirty one proper [noise]\nWhen you read the book of wisdom in the Bible written by Solomon there's thirty one of them which makes it fairly easy to read one a day\nSo if you don't do anything else in your spiritual walk or in your search for wisdom you can read one proverb a day\nAnd if you do that over and over and over twelve times you want to read that book in one year right and I'm Thirty years later I have read it a bunch of times and I you know ... book wisdom and I you know what if you actually understand the stuff you will get wiser\nIsn't that interesting you know and here's what happens when you get wiser your life gets better\n'cause he quit doing stupid stuff you know I figured out the less stupid

and by the way that makes one rich\nInteresting isn't it\nThe hand of the diligent\nThe hand hand of the diligent makes one rich\nSo here's one of the things I figured out I read this study years ago and now the observed it in all the millionaires we meet with and talk with and and it showed up again in this millionaire study that Chris Hogan and the team just did for the everyday millionaire project and we interviewed ten thousand millionaires among the things we found there and one of the things we found in this study before that that I read years ago was\nPeople who have wealth and keep wealth and build well have a long term planning window\nWhen they're making a decision about an action a purchase something they're going to do they think to themselves house is going to affect me five or ten or Fifteen Years from now\nI'm forty five and I'm looking to retire at the time um I have a pension and I'll be getting like Seventy five percent of my pay [laughter] I'm In or one K. and stuff like that but um\nAnd I've already paid off some of my dad but um what's left is only about thirty four hundred but I'm sure I'll be on the path of Ninety Days for um [noise] but my question is I've been looking into refinancing in my house because I have a chance so I have\nPM I and I when I Do the math like the six thousand dollars and closing costs versus a\nHundred and eighty seven month ends up being three years plus my interest rate is going to go up so I'm not sure if that's the smart thing to do because\nYou know stay in the home longer than three years is the only way you're going to get an gravy on that biscuit right yeah for sure so um that's how your in laws and um that's that's kinda borderline that's the tipping point is much longer than three years I probably on your break even analysis are probably would not\nBut if you're you know Ninety percent sure you're going to be there longer than three years you're going to pass the break even point star making money even at a higher interest rate is what you're telling me right\nI'm In a while I'll get out of having to pay the hundred and eighty seven\nYou know but where your interest rates go up and offset that\n... well yeah 'cause I'm a three point seven five now and everything I'm getting quotas about like for\nYou know so you're not going to make any money [laughter] so is it better just to stay in it and pay the\nThumb and you're gonna be a flush I'm probably gonna be four seven five on a Fifteen year right now today and so that's like one percent spread 'em and so what is your a loan them out\n[noise] this one is a hundred and sixty six thousand okay\nAnd so one in three years I've already paid off ten thousand now about\nOne percent on a hundred and sixty six thousand increase is sixteen hundred dollars a year okay and you're only saving Eighteen hundred or a hundred and eighty dollars a month which is about two thousand dollars a year so no I wouldn't do this if that's the only if that's the numbers\nYeah I'm okay everybody\nSickly breaking even to refinance and I wouldn't do that I pay the loan off\n[noise] and then I add one other question I just joined ... P U and in my area everybody's already in session but some of them have only done one class that I still go in\nYeah jumping you'll be okay All right yeah the first classes on savings and you're already out of the game on that you're you didn't miss anything and and go back and watch it on with your own line 'cause you've got a one year membership and you can watch and listen to everything on line for a year\nOkay so yeah you go and watch the blessing one and then when you go in in Iraq whatsoever zone listen to your right in sync okay you know troubles are all doing great way to go dawn you killed a ghetto Christine is with us in Boise idaho I Christina how're you\nDoing well thank you Dave I'm so we have an an an agreed situation for our family but I'm not quite sure how to proceed we um [noise] it's called her home in California and walked away with a lot of equity\nUm and has since moved to Boise how much but we I'm Sorry what was that how much equity\nAbout two hundred and forty thousand boom boom love it yeah I'm Still we're here just renting while we kind of figure out you know if we want to build or by 'em\nBut I'm not quite sure um because we already have are are saving we have our retirement we have all that [laughter] you out of debt that we just go yeah we don't have any debt good\nUm but do we just go and maybe pay cash for a house yeah really what we want or do we\nWant we want is we want where we you know we want something that's gonna cost us more than what we have\nOkay the only thing I don't think\nI might well I mean what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and fifty\nOkay and what what would you be talking about building or buying what price range\n... between four and six\nOkay and you have to forty in the bank okay so if we should for forty as an example Utah over two hundred thousand dollar mortgage right All right how about your company that all five years\nYou know I mean just knock it out how old are you got [noise] um I'm forty five and my husband it if\nYou have any money in savings or investments to this not in a retirement account\nNow off okay All right\nWell my rule of thumb is never take out a mortgage that is on more than a Fifteen year mortgage and the payments more than a fourth of your take home pay you're not even going to approach that right\nWay and I'm going to be close to that and so if you take out a two hundred two hundred fifty thousand or more did you have a really fine house in Boise idaho for half a million dollars that's a lot of house that's wonderful property\nAnd from what we're hoping more Korea property that in a big house [laughter] you\nKnow it's a whole different world though obviously from where you got him from rights and so um I mean you're bang for buck is huge in Boise compared to\nYou know a big City California so um yeah you you're going to make a huge progress here and you know you just about whatever if you take a small mortgage or out in a small relative to your situation in other words\nI'm not going to yell at you know I don't borrow money so ... we'd be buying a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar house and then we'd be saving money and we'd move up later\nAnd that's how we would cause I mean we don't borrow money for any reason ever but if it's the only thing I don't yell at you for borrowing on on this show and in your case though just how the different mindset\nThat the mortgage is just more like a car loan\nAnd we're just going to knock it out real fast\nI mean like other people's ready to Carla like five years or something you know let's just put on there and\nHow fast can we knock this thing in the head and let's get after it and that's how I Want to think about it it's a really good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Sarah is in California Hi Sarah welcome to the day Ramsey\nShow Hi Dave how are you know better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] and I was wondering if I should tell my car worth about Eighteen thousand ... pay off my about forty thousand dollars worth of debt and start my emergency fund my card paid off\nWhat is your household income\nAbout thirty thousand a year\nYou should not have an Eighteen thousand dollar car ... is too much tied up happening is going down in value when you're how when your car or things with motors your wheels of any kind added up equals more than half your annual income how did you end up with an Eighteen dollar paid for car making thirty grant\nI'm married and we refinanced our house and included the car in the mortgage and then he got and\nAnd then we got a divorce and we sold the house and the car was paid off\nGot it okay and I got a car and so what is your um\nWhat is your income prospects meaning you're thirty now where will you be in a year where were you being three years\nRight around thirty thirty tail\nSo you don't see that you don't see this doubling then\nNo okay why\nA\n... and I haven't got to school yet\nOkay and I'm a single mother and father had yeah you you need the money more than you need a car don't you\nYeah yeah I in the cars going down in value\nAnd she found in place and get you an inexpensive car that you pay cash for probably in the five thousand dollar range\nOkay maybe seven something like that there's something reliable and you can get lots of car for five to seven thousand dollars right now\nAnd you're dead tree and you've got a good emergency fund and that put you in a much better position but as a rule of thumb cars are the largest thing that we all by that goes down in value anything on wheels or motors for that matter if it's got wheeler motor\nIt's going down about you and when you have all of that stuff out of the gather you don't want too much of your life financially too much of the math\nWay and you get when you have more than half your in your own income tied up and things going down in value then that makes it real tough to prosper and you're ... you're going to change your income by going to school and things you don't change later but\nI'm with you yeah I Would sell that cost this is Dave Ramsey show\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nIt's\nTime to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend the quick Churchill checkup and just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage can tell you if\nYou could save some cash each month they've helped thousands upon thousands of my listeners keep more cash in their pockets tourists martyr mortgage\nWant you to call Churchill for your check up and see if you can lower your monthly payment or better yet she how you can pay off your house or like think about it what could you do with your money if you didn't have a mortgage called Churchill a AAA alone two hundred triple light alone two hundred or visit Churchill mortgage dot com\nAnd so ah you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on home with a mortgage there is rich and so I'm getting rid of that\nWas found this it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula\nBecause when you don't have a mortgage you start making different decisions with your career\nYou start making different purchase decisions used are having different levels of enjoyment with your money your relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before and those things are really hard to put on paper so\nWhat I have figured out is I'm going to live a hundred percent that free\nAnd I'm going to invest like crazy the rest of the money that I have in cash that comes in and I've ended up with a ton of money doing that because I don't have any risk and I'm just investing real money not borrowed money so all of that to say if I woke up in your shoes I pay off your mortgage today\nAnd if you ... if this discussion good sour on you and you think they ran she's crazy a year from now just get you another mortgage\nNo I I I completely agree I mean I I prefer the one thing that saves just if it's a lot of money I go oh you know I just [noise] so I mean I my dad saying just paid off but my mind sort of just wrestle back and forth\nAnd and I what I'm trying to point out is is your the your gut is not intellectually wrong your mind is your minds using an incomplete primitive formula\nGot it\nThat's what I'm pointing out is that makes sense completely yeah paid off do you got this thanks for the call open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five see your heart story is not your real you guys your heart your heart's where you measure risk my heart's telling me pay off my house\nMy hands telling me I could make more money ... money but your heads missing some stuff it's missing risk\nAnd um it's kind of a fun thing to I was doing this for the class of MBAs speaking to them and a cause MBAs or all talk you know masters in business they're all taught strategic thought and then we'll talk to borrow money\nAnd uh I got a finance degree I was taught to borrow money my broke finance professor used to teach us to borrow money and so um you know it it's broke finance professor is like a shop teacher was missing fingers right people so think about this or I was like a ... you just can't think that way and you have a different way of looking at things so\nUm but then you can really do a very sophisticated mathematical application of this it would just take a lot of time too much time really in the radio to walk through the whole thing but what happens is is think about this\nHow many of you if you had zero debt and you looked over in your four O. one K. and there's three hundred thousand dollars\nAnd you had forty thousand bucks in the bank for your emergency fund would make different career decisions\nWay too many have you just said yes meaning I Would leave this jerk but I worked for and I would go do dot dot dot\nUnless I go in business for yourself necessarily you might just have a different career you might go in a completely different direction that thing you've always wanted to do why are you waiting\nYou know and here's the weird thing is that thing you've always wanted to do is probably where you make the most money you've ever made in your life if you're wise about how you do it this idea that if you're going to ... and you make half the money you make twice the money\nYou make more money when you're doing something you're good at because you work harder at it your creative you think about all the time you can't keep yourself or moving 'cause you love it\nAnd again my laptop writing a blog article I Can't keep myself from doing it I Can't keep myself from coming down here in doing this radio show when I'm In town\nI was ...\nAnd I'm really good at it as a consequence and guns once I get paid a lot\nOf money\nOn a ... I'm a capitalist pig baby I love this I'm here baby that's how I don't want that for you see that's what set you up to be how many of you if you didn't have any payments or do your ball she was a jerk\nStick it take this job and shut it I mean we would do that yeah there you go that's a man and I'm not telling you\nQuit your job today I'm saying there are benefits to being debt free that are beyond the simple mathematics of the fact you don't have to pay interest day more you start to be set free slavery is more than simple\nPossession ah\nChanges to somebody with a\n... ... a slave\nIs lay the one\nCall nicer that's great because this is a day Ramsey\n\n\nCourse dumps here you ever talk to people who say things like becoming a millionaire was impossible these days\nOr people are only millionaires because they come from already wealthy families well we just got done with the largest research ever conducted on American millionaires and bill simple truth is everyday people become millionaires all the time\nHow did they do it the overwhelming majority did so by investing consistently\nAnd with the help and guidance upper professional\nThat's why our team has already done the hard work for you we've vetted and interviewed thousands of investing professionals all across the country who are committed to helping you reach your goals get started today go to Dave Ramsey dot com slash smart buster and look up the smart goes through prose and your area\n...

don't have it on a ball and a for a long term investment because I'm not sure exactly like man I Would be asked to leave the country [noise] um I'm not visited up but you don't get\nI'm not alone put them into my back I'm On here I live um\nUm but minimum like I honestly picks both of the ... the company ... and ... and both of 'em for about I mean on one that I'm putting in on it I live on that I have I'm saving in my background and in from outside of the gate and tried\nTo buy 'em off of your show it eventually I'm Talking to a game\nOr maybe not the right way to get a um I mean I became quote I'm ... I'm Out in a long term commitment yeah ...\nUh I mean the problem with short term investments says it's a very very hard um the you know short term investments basically savings account and it's going to pay you know one to two percent right now\nI'm you know and when you do long term investments and then you pull them out short term as you said you can get the market could move down on you and you could actually lose some of the money so um if you want to position some of it in long term investments with the idea that\nAh the hope that we are going to make some more but the idea that we could actually lose some won't take some risk where some of that that's an okay thing to do um\nBut you know basically if you know you're going to need the money and the actual principals very important to you I you know there's not a ... intermediate investment that I'm comfortable with that I use a so I'm pretty much either putting it in a savings account or I'm investing it\nAnd sometimes I'm investing it knowing that I may or may only be in their year and it could be down in a year and but I'm going to take that risk because that's money I can say that I have a little bit of um margin with meaning I Can't afford to lose a little bit of money\nAnd if that's the case then then it's okay but that that's what we're faced with the ... is in Minneapolis ...\nHey Dave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUh Hi I'm I'm currently in college and I paid cash transfers master and I'm planning on joining the national guard but I'm Wondering if I should continue going to college after I joined the national guard or if I should go back to my home town and just live with my parents so that I'm basically getting paid to go to college\nOkay when you go back to your home town live with your parents you would go to a different college\nYeah I'd go to a university that's within twenty minutes of my parents' house\nOkay if you don't go back home he would stay where you are obviously and you would um can you pay cash\n[noise] uh yeah if I was able to if I can save the money that I'm making during the national guard and I work on top of that I should build the cash flow it\nOkay and how much do you like finishing school\nExcuse me what year\nThree and a half years to go or whatever well\nYeah and then I Am actually think we have more credit I graduate in two years\nOkay she got two years to go what are you studying finance okay and why would you stay where you are\n[noise] just because it has a better business school recognition I guess for the state mhm which\nAre the other places water community college or university this local or\nYeah just a local university and not as um right now I'm at the University of Minnesota which a lot bigger I guess too\nRight okay All right well um [noise] if you actually get the knowledge of the reputation of the school really doesn't matter much in Ninety nine percent of the jobs out there\nIf you actually get the knowledge now if the actual quality of the education is lower than that is a different discussion okay but\nI Would not stay someplace merely for its reputation [noise] but there's other reasons that you want to stay in that location you like it there you want to stay in that area you know you've enjoyed the\nUh the experience of being there and you're willing to work to pay for it if you can pay cash for it I'm OK either way [noise]\nThere's not a financial problem either direction\nWhere you want your degree to be from where you want to live for the next two years of study\nAt your age I likely would have stayed where you are\nOwn uh\nWay and that's okay [noise] so you're just trying to what is it what's the pay off the extra effort\nIt that's what you're asking me this is the day

make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't big difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to the sand or insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and\nNumber three is shelter now you pay your rent\nIt doesn't matter if you pay your rent and you can't sleep there because there is no heat so you gotta

why ... why not three yards Fifteen\n[laughter] well the tone of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down and remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups is\nYou know groups small groups in my workshop you will will they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and\nI was sitting there trying to figure out how to do this in a workshop because this is back in two thousand and eight and then I wasn't I hadn't really done many workshops before you know I'm an investigative reporter by training that's how I used to bust baby selling rings when I was young\nSo um so I I'm kicking around this with my husband and I'm sort of thing well I don't know maybe I'll just put people in groups of eight and or so and having a sin healing intention to each other and he's a good headline writer and he said yeah I Love it the power of eat\nSo it came about totally by accident we put people in groups of eight in our workshop first when we ran in Chicago I I was kind of I I knew how to do intention I studied it within tension masters I'd put together a program I'd looked at what we're doing scientific in the scientific lab\nBut I wasn't sure about these small groups should they hold hands which and they do so I'm I'm kind of making it up as I go along\nAnd the next day I figured I'd I have him come back the next day and tell us what happened and I'd had all the groups and intention to somebody in the group with some sort of health challenge\nAnd when they came back I assume they were going to tell me it's it's kind of like having a facial or getting back ... do you know nice little feel good effect\nThat isn't what happened what happened is stuff like this they lined up I gave them the Mike and turn and they said things like I have cataracts and their eighty percent better\nI'm due for a knee replacement my knees completely messed up and I'm walking normally today and I can do deep squats\nI have terrible insomnia and I slept like a baby\nLike that total instant healing and I was completely shocked because as I said I'm you know I I look at things as a journalist I'm I look at things I Try to look at the science of things are trying to prove things and this was completely out of my realm\nSo I didn't believe that I like to be honest George I thought it was a placebo effect but then it started happening over and over and over I mean I've run hundreds of these things and I've had people where\nTheir their arm is dislocated and its slots back into place during the intention or somebody who had couldn't see well because she had a stroke and her eyes went back to normal\nSomebody ... says who went completely out of pain and we then you know a month or so were daughter wrote me just say that her back straight in so much they had to change the rearview mirror for car\nStories like this over and over again and the same thing going on with some of the Sanders too and that was the thing that really was amazing\nTo me are told me about the centers or how how powerful must be and then what was happening to them\nWell their ordinary people this is the amazing thing of it George we all have this power this is our birthright it's just we don't know this we don't know how to use it we don't realize it amplifies in a group let me tell you about the story of with\nEven with when I met him I put together a couple of groups at the mile high church in Denver just is kind of just as a test this is last last on them last muscle and um I west wanted to put himself forward he was one of the the initial groups\nUm because he suffered from terrible depression but there was a woman there with stage ... cancer\nLinda and so we we decided to go with her but when it's had a terrible life he had been a really bright guy in college studying biochemistry wanting to be a doctor and he got a he got cold and he had a loan lottery number in the very last years of the Vietnam War\nAnd they'd done away with drafted ... for college um college students\nSo we had to go in the last horrible chaotic years of the war\nAnd it was so traumatic for him he came back\nWas really depressed and that continued in his life even even lost the love of his life too fast growing cancer it was just terrible story so by the time he he got to meeting me he'd gone to a point of feeling like what's the use\nAnd he was living in a senior facility barely able to get up and make themselves breakfast in the morning really depressed\nSo he does his intention for Linda [noise]\nAnd then that next day he told me he woke up and everything had really changed it was almost like you had this amazing heightened to sensory awareness you know the grass is greener than it ever been he drank a cup of herbal tea and it knocked his socks off he says\nUm but even more amazing was the next night he had this extraordinary vision on a dream almost like a vision where he was back in college and he met his Nineteen year old self\nAnd the the Nineteen year Old West communicated to him in some way it's all going to be okay there's still plenty of time\nAnd that experience to him was so life transforming he's a completely different guy now he is power walking Ninety minutes the lifting weights he's running group says it's at his church he's writing\nAnd he had completely given up and that is only one time from being a cinder um and this is a story I hear over and over again we're that act of being part of this group of being kind of a higher consciousness is life transforming\nWindows the sender need to have any special abilities\nOh here's the really interesting thing of it you know I again did not believe that so I was looking at it from every angle um it took me ten years to even get the courage to write this book\nAnd we should you were the skeptic a bowl skeptics\nI was I was the ultimate doubting Thomas because as I said I\nI started the intention experiments because I wasn't I wasn't really sure about all of this manifestation law attraction I didn't I wasn't sure I believed it and I wanted to find out how far can you take it you know are we talking about the shifting a quantum particles are we talking about curing cancer here\nSo I'm definitely set up the intention experiments but I never I never thought these little groups would have the power but the thing that's so interesting is\nI had a life universities the largest chiropractic university I'm In the world and they offered to do studies of the power of eight to let their nearest science department look at this\nSo we sent up eight groups of students\nAnd we put a ... G kept to measure the brain waves of each one person one sender in each of the groups and what we found was so amazing that within a few minutes\nThey would have this completely different brainwave signature it would turn off all the parts of the ... group would have a quieting of all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate\nAnd also the parts of the brain that make us\nHave worry doubt negativity\nSo these are basically brainwave signatures of somebody who's feeling a sense of ecstatic one this and when we compared these signatures when the nearest scientists who work at the doctor said Stephanie Sullivan um we looked at\nOther things like the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monks in ecstatic prayer they had an identical brainwave signature but the only difference was\nI had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a sushi master sure my guys were total novices they were students who'd never even done meditation and all they had was uh twelve minute video for me\nWas to do when we're going to court break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work\nThe power of age and

take much effort to make things happen\nWill that one of the interesting thing about this\nNo it doesn't I think what it takes is meeting regularly it it takes some techniques and you know in my book the power of eight I've got all the techniques that people have to to follow to become a really good in tender and also to intend well and a group\nBut for me the thing the real key element is creating a little group of eight or so and you ask me for it have to be a no fiber work\nFigure out you know it's like the not too big not too little um but what's really important is meeting week after week after week\nAnd I found that after I'm putting people in groups in twenty Fifteen I wanted to do my own experiment because I wanted to see if everything in their lives would begin to heal not just their health\nSo I got a group of two hundred and fifty together and had them you know I taught them for a while and then I put them in groups of eight or so and had the meat every week for a whole year\nAnd it was extraordinary of the people who continued to meet regularly you know every week and that was about a hundred and fifty of them\nPretty much a hundred percent of them had major life changing experience is so it wasn't just their house\nYou know they got financial windfall or they got amazing new careers or they meet up with this strange relatives or you know they got a great new house just the one they wanted um just came out of nowhere or they found a new knife purpose but\nPretty much everybody had extraordinary stories to tell\nOur our ... are you sure that this works uh primarily from the ... or ... or science retard\n[noise] well I think there's a science in the sense that um we did that brainwaves study\nAnd we found that you know there are major brain changes that go on when you do intention of in a group called ... group prayer in a way I'm In a sense that's what it is it's kind of secular prayer\nBecause you have these major changes which are really very very much similar to somebody having a mystical state you know somebody having a mystical experience people get changed during those kinds of experiences\nAnd they allow themselves to be open to a lot of possibilities or they suddenly feel you know something major has changed all their senses are heightened um they feel really optimistic about their future\nAnd so in a way that starts to pave the way if you want to just look at what happens to the individual that paved the way for major changes\nAnd and possibilities\nBut there's something more is is a bigger piece of this George that\nAnd believe me I'm trying to figure out what is it is a group of fact you know is it just the power of intention but a big piece of this is the power of altruism\nUm that was the big surprise for me because remember the Sanders we're having amazing effects to healing effects\nAnd when I started looking into\nUm the science of altruism it's extraordinary I mean people who do stuff for other people no matter how small live longer are happier are healthier in every regard and nuts what we found in a lot of our intention groups\nI mean when I talk about that group and twenty Fifteen and I was studying for a whole year\nI'm One of the people you know there were a couple of people that weren't getting anywhere you know one of them was a woman called Andy and Andy was going through a divorce\nAnd she had two small kids she needed a new job and she was very talented in marketing and coaching and she just couldn't get anything you know young woman just couldn't get anything and she was just trying everything and we talked with her and tried to work with her and this and that are group tried to work with their infant hobbies\nYou know offer yourself start intending for someone else and she was one of the people who was intending for the young boy Luke\nAnd the moment she did that she gets a coal out of the blue from somebody offering her a dream job\nSo can I tell you any everything about how this works sure absolutely not [laughter] there is a complete X factor here I don't understand but there is something about that\nPower of getting off for yourself and doing for someone else that seems to get a reward for you which\nAre convinced that works aren't you\nI Am convinced it works I watch it as I say I sort of look at it almost like a scientist I've looked at\n... groups over years um you know I run I run these year low master classes and I'm I'm actually evaluating what's happening to people they're filling out forms every month to say what's changed in their lives\nAnd you know we've done the brain studies were going to do immune systems studies um and just seeing what happens in groups right in front of me you know I Know it works\nOr than others some little limited don't get results in the ...\nWell I think it's the people who don't come regularly um sometimes it's nothing to do with skepticism that's the interesting thing too I gave a talk once in in Denver last last year\nAnd there was a woman who had really bad arthritis and she was a total skeptic and she got healed right away right there\nAnd um you know we've had people like that who haven't who were a little skeptical really didn't you know sought to themselves yeah right and they had some healing doesn't mean everybody in an audience gets healed but a lot of them you know there's enough to say something really interesting is going on here\nAnd are you interested in the humane because it's easier to track in terms of the experiments\nOh you mean at physical healing ... yeah because it is not\nA the the the ... you know somebody had a condition they don't have the conditions growing up we had a woman with stage ... cancer I talked about earlier and she's now you know down to normal numbers now she was doing other stuff too but the intention pushed it right along\nSomebody else with T. M. J. problems as a temper mandate dealer joint problems in your job\nAnd uh that she was sort of suffering where the pain of eight or nine out of ten and it went immediately down to two and then the pain was gone over days\nSo this kind of thing you know it's kind of this healed in an instant or soon after is the thing that you can as you say really track but then you've got other things we're amazing ... happen you know another woman who was\nTrying to write a book she was a body work um expert Lisa\nAnd she was in one of these year long groups and she was trying to write a book about\nShe figured out a way to treat trauma victims with body work and she wanted to write this book about it she'd never written a book and she was getting new where she had three different editors and just nothing was happening\nAnd and the group was intending for nothing was happening and finally once again I simply say get off for yourself and she started ... intending to another member of the group who had some serious health issues\nAnd again the next week she has she feels compelled to go into a store\nAnd she didn't even need anything at the store and when she gets in there she meets\nAnd as they got chatting it turns out this woman was a former publisher and he's now a book coach and when she hears what Lisa wants to do she offers to coach or through the whole thing end of the story Lisa gets her book done and it becomes an Amazon best seller\n\n\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa [laughter]\nRiverside through come to this is what do you see these subtle

journalist too and so you recognize the five W than age I usually tell people you know what reporters have to learn is when they grow to lead story they write in an intro they have to do\nWho what when where and why and how and how and that's not a bad thing to do when you're formulating an intention\nIf a story includes all those ingredients you got a pretty good story\nExactly and for an intention it's the same thing you've got to say what do you want you know the number of people on my master class who will do things like I Want to be rich\nAnd you know they don't really want to be rich what they want is usually you know in the sense of having loads and loads of money and more stuff what they want is\nThey don't want the job there in what they want is not to worry so much anymore they need a certain amount of money they may not necessarily need to be rich\nUm what they want is more time to spend with their children or grandchildren and so what you have to do is try to figure out first what you want what is that you really want and then tell the universe exactly what you want and\nThe other thing I notice George is oftentimes the universe\nGives us what we need not necessarily what we're trying to say we need like um I had one group one master class a intention group of eight\nAnd they said well we're intending for all of us to win the lottery [laughter] and I said to them why what do you need and they said well gene needs twelve thousand dollars\nI'm for child\nAnd Joan needs another Fifteen thousand dollars to get a car and so and so need this and that and I said well why do you intend for the meat individually and ask for what exactly they need because that's probably what the universe is going to give you you know\nSo it's it's really about first of all figuring out what you want exactly and then telling\n... right on it yeah exactly well here's an opportunity for you to talk with Lynn Mick Jagger about intention let's start by going to Thomas in ... California Tom go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call lamb it's really a pleasure a comment and then a question um I ... just you know your audio watcher programs one called living but field and the other one called living with\nIntention and boy those audio compact desks are in constant rotation on my CD player I just want you to know that they're just south so much information now using the about\nRetro causality retro in tension and you cite a number of experiments that\nAppear to prove that we can not only in ... for the ...\nThe past that the past is not fixed and stone so to speak that there appears to be with experimental proof you cite a lot of researchers\nThere appears to be a robust cross talk between past and the future\nAnd you cite ... v chi how much mapped all job of the peer group in Princeton and each of the experiments that they did that appear to show that you can influence the past that the past is not fixed my question for you\nCan you utilize retro intention retro causality for healing [noise]\nThat's such a great question thank you um yes the answer is the short answer is yes now I Do this all the time in my master classes a workshop semi just random retreat in Italy last week and we were doing a lot of red true intentions one\nI tend to do though is you can't change the past of what of what happened in the sense of\nIt happened what you can do though is change your response to it and going forward and in a way that is part of this whole thing of time being really elastic time being one big smeared out now and that's what the studies you're talking about demonstrate is that\nYou know we what they really show is that\nAnd this is a weird thing um we don't change the past we changed the present as it unfolds the future affects the present as it unfolds all those studies show\nBut just to answer your question why tend to do is ask people to go back to a seed moment\nA moment in their health just when something just started before it blew up to full blown disease a moment where they first argument argued with somebody in a relationship\nAnd it then deteriorated afterward just that moment when it started or a moment when somebody told you you weren't good enough as a child or you were terrible at some things just just did something like that\nAnd go back and change your response to that teacher and you say no I'm not used to sit math I just don't understand this now I Will later something like that or imagine\nThat that healing that that illness doesn't blow up into full blown disease\nI'm actually had somebody

Dr wallich would you just thank him he's saved my life so you helped a lot of people\nIt literally millions were fifty countries now Georgia and are so very proud of that we have five thousand products to do with over nine hundred different diseases and uh it's just that we run into this all over the world\nAnd then I had a couple of weeks ago that I see you know when you were going to view on was and you've talked about this but eating foods like bacon and sausages they say may raise the risk of breast cancer what's going on here\nIt's an absolute fact or you know it my thesis for my postdoctoral fellowship in the sixties and seventies and did twenty thousand autopsies I'm Seventeen thousand some change over four hundred and fifty four species of animals and three thousand humans are looking for\nA a common thread were animals were getting the same um diseases in death from the same pollutants because everybody knew the earth is going to end until he's from pollution as humans\nAnd when he found was of course that there were no deaths from a pollution\nUm but they did find that when people ate one serving a day whether the male or female they won Serbia Dave any causes me things like Delhi slices sandwich meat sauce a ham bacon baloney salami pastrami pepperoni dirt economy spam trees all those kinds of things [noise]\nUm then increase their risk many different types of cancers at the same rate as smoking two packs of cigarettes a day I I wrote that up and published in Nineteen Seventy one everybody laughed at me well in two thousand Fifteen the world Health Organization and set it and then just a couple of weeks ago there's\nBig study in England where they said they looked at like five hundred thousand people who are eating these processed meats and sure enough you know men get breast cancer yeah that's true\nYou know Israel of women and of course it also have um the cause and effect or in a lung cancer and colorectal cancer and stomach cancer and so on and flew back and so I had an them eat and processed meats for fifty years\nDr I've got a friend of mine who has been are just starting the regimen a ... a little late and let me tell

I had my bats and do a combination\nI mean we have and probably probably two dozen antioxidant product that would take them all but um there's two of them are wanted which was done in a big study I'm In I'm a Charlotte North Carolina I'm In the medical school\nAnd there was a ten year study a hundred and twenty million dollar study was the government's study and um it's it's on her Muskie dying grape seed extract has a liquid from our um nature's Pearl division and it's probably shouldn't treat journals\nAnd it just came out like last year at the end of the study and it was one of the most effective um cancer which I say survival um products and so liquid and you take two servings a day per hundred pounds of body weight\nAnd um there was nothing like it out there and then so they they were just so excited I'm a hundred and twenty million dollar governments to medical school in Charlotte North Carolina published in the medical journals and sort of liquid extract of of from the mosquito and grape seed and it's just a beautiful product\nAnd then of course we have we call her Rosie radical\nUh eight hundred and fifty university studies in Japan\nOn CSI radical it or has\nThe few Clayton which is an extract from red green algae they credit is the reason why they have so few cancer deaths there and they have a a lower rate of cancer than any other nation because they eat so much of this\nRed green algae as part of their sushi stuff as part of their standard that [noise] and so we have a product cozy radical and two cards either capsules and the radical the liquid\nAnd so I take that to him and of course I'd take the most 'cause I ain't grape seed capsules and they take the most getting grape seed liquid his for prevention I keep my immune system a top and I don't eat the processed meats\nAnd um and and so you get your body than Ninety essential nutrients to sixteen minerals sixteen vitamins from as a pet is your body functions probably including your immune system\nAnd you're going to do very well um your quality of life goes up it live longer you are able to fend off and avoid so many diseases because most of the ones that used to be said to be genetic it really just simple nutritional deficiency disease is\nAnd that's why my thesis charges in the Smithsonian Institute is natural treasure and sells for twenty five thousand dollars\nEach jeeze that's amazing and young jeopardy the company behind critical Health News dot com is entering the cannabis markets a big way right now we're ...

Helen\nYes I have a question in I'm In the last week that I have retired ... pre diabetes okay create diabetes yes can you explain them that's what the consequences of this and this let's have a happy ending okay well first of all\nI can certainly have a bad and they can kill you and move forward kills you you get your feet amputated 'cause you have bad circulation and go blind you get cardiovascular disease always ... and everything else and they're up in so there's many many complications of type ... diabetes which makes up Ninety eight percent of the diabetic population\nAnd type ... diabetes or is actually ... nutritional deficiency of a single mineral\nOr is not a genetic in any way shape or form it can be family because everybody eats the same way they cook the same way they live in the same regions and so it would be division that same nutrients and so we take people who've been serious are brutal diabetics for Thirty years in thirty days or next diabetic\nAnd so I'm involved we have to know how much you weigh how much the way how in\nProbably about a hundred feet high one sixty five\nOkay and so do you have any other issues quickly like asthma bronchitis and his skin problems eggs amateur and tired of psoriasis for\nBomb problems no I had cancer forty years ago okay what type over\nOvarian and you'd be good for you good for you yes absolutely okay so in a hundred and fifty five pounds and had to give up all the bad stuff for pre diabetic that means no fried foods no exceptions know fried foods and processed meats\nAnd know Delhi's flights Assange means he talked about it earlier or eating processed meats and will increase your risk of cancer could be ovarian cancer\nAnd could also uh um cause many other types of cancer I'm the same as smoking two packs of cigarettes and so you got to get rid of the process needs no oils and I'll I'll cook in our own margin of any soldier than cooking it causes free radical damage to your arteries and so forth and\nDamage your intestines he can't absorb that a hundred and fifty five pounds you're perfect candidate\nFor two or healthy blood sugar packs there's one healthy pleasure pack or a hundred pounds of body weight\nAnd as a pre diabetic you want to kind of put all in your car before the engine burns up they don't want to wait and take a full blown diabetes before you jump on it and so you take these I'm a full does everything twice today there's two of the healthy a butcher packs per month and take a bulldozer everything\nA breakfast and dinner time including the CDs\nAnd to check your own blood sugar you don't need to go to the doctor every time to get your was your taking you go to to the a pharmacy that prescription get the test strips and you check your your blood sugar and your bushes started coming down\nAnd a ... if you're not on medication is beautiful if you're on medication the you need less and less medication and usually within thirty to sixty days your next diabetic and says simple nutritional deficiency in is that genetic as easy to prevent easy to get rid of\nAll right good luck to hell on hope everything works out always when you called in to talk to dock if you have a piece of paper and pencil or pen with you because he give you a lot of information but if you miss it\nGo one eight five five nine for nine seven two three four he is trained people there that

been doing that for fifty years okay and so basically I'm In my book careers ventures in chapter eleven in chapter eleven and goes into the great details of the usefulness of their hair analysis is something that medical doctors do not do\nAnd you can also pick up you can detect all kinds of things with a hair analysis you can any other part of the physical exam for instance a blood test won't

the single nutrient George it can only pick up with a hair analysis\nReally yeah and so there's been hundreds of millions of dollars spent on this research was a wonderful study which has written up in this book ... ventures in chapter is four or five and six in chapter eleven in fact people who did not have access to AK forty sevens\nWind up killing three hundred people in the Seventeen like they do they have already seven or fifty eight like this to\nSteve Steve impacted in Vegas yeah and so he was deficient in that new ... and that's why the government the FBI two months ago threw up their hand say you know we have no evidence of domestic terrorism international terrorism we don't know why this guy did this shooting in Vegas that's because they did not do a hair analysis on him\nNow that single ingredient and I know you don't like to tell us the single ingredient because you think people rush out and you just get that in they forget about everything else other than that eighty nine but can you have to us a little bit about what's that called\nAt the same mineral and it will tell you that it used to be the\nMain ingredient of seven up really yeah at the turn of the century when Coca Cola was coming on strong at the turn of the twentieth century why did they call it Coca Cola causes made from cocaine\nAnd a Coca Cola and seven of the reasons why doctors lobbied to get 'em pharmaceuticals prescription I'm required\nA little drugstore grocery stores you can get you know the guy behind the counter to pull that little handle it and give you a glass full of coca Coca Cola for [laughter]\nAnd uh you got your cocaine and your pain when we didn't need to go to the doctor same thing was true when you had um suicidal tendencies you're depressed and had manic depression\nAnd uh you know you're not with domestic violence he already killed ten twenty people in your neighborhood nobody knew it yet because you know you're going out at night and killing with an axe or with a rope around their neck or throwing a I'm a I'm yelling glass jar of of a gasoline into a church and then thrown as a a torch and there and killing three hundred and in an hour\nOkay and so um it's a single nutrient and the seven up\nAnd it says single nutrient and they're two different nutrients in seven up as one and then a Coca Cola was the other one\nKnow now we know it's not

Bush would they ought to do is go a more moderate business friendly super popular Democrat route in a perfect ticket would have been\nPhil Bredesen Evan by that was my dream ticket for the Democrats in two thousand eight um\nI was not amused with where the primary was going on the Republican side not that I wanted a Democrat and control the White House but if you were going to get on and your options on the Republican side where Mitt Romney or John McCain\nOr then maybe I Would have entertained they Phil Bredesen Evan by ticket I I'm I'm it would have been the first time I would have ever voted for Democrat at the national level um\nBut I Would have at least entertained\nWell Phil Bredesen did not run for president to designate a Evan by did not run for president to does need though he was strongly blooded as a ... or reasonable Democrat yeah they both are\nYeah I mean you know well Tennessee has a Senate contest going on right now Phil brightest and now all\nI mean to be going to the Senate he's old you should not be sending people in the sixties or the Senate but I no longer tendency resident so I don't care who they send up to an end of the more other states to send a bunch of old white guys up there that are going to die young I'm fine with that sentiment that because I just increases Alabama's cloud as time goes by [noise] um\nAnyway they're locked in a race all the polling right now indicates\nMarsha Blackburn is going to be Phil Bredesen by handsome margin\nTen points twelve point maybe eight at the at the lowest uh for some reason Taylor Swift waded into this and uh\nI I think I Know why I think they're getting her ready to attack Trump in twenty twenty and in order to do that they couldn't have Trump be the first person she had sort of gone out on a limb to oppose so they have are opposing Marsha Blackburn um\nFor various reasons who knows why um but uh but that's what they do and when you are in the entertainment business and you are worth hundreds of millions of dollars or something even suggest billions of dollars and Taylor Swift situation\nOr they can destroy you in a heartbeat and if you don't play the game they will destroy you'll be black balled from the radio stations MTV will quit promoting you all the uh\nA great positive press you get all over the time that all goes away and you're gone you're like Brittany spears you know you shake your head and hit people umbrellas [laughter]\nThat's correct not a Marsha Blackburn fan but why\nAre they she shrill\nAnd during the big guys the hearings\nOh baby she did that was not her shining no it was not but\nI Would vote for a Republican because Trump needs the help yeah and y'all need to remember that when you\nYou know well here's the headline today I'm Phil Bredesen was trying to improve his electoral chances recognizing that that the confirm Kavanaugh movement was really sweeping the nation and uniting Republicans in recognizing that\nTendency is about a Republican plus tenor plus twelve state and so in order for Phil Bredesen to when he had to peel off some of those Republicans presumably who wanted to confirm Kavanaugh\nSo he comes out publicly and says I think Kevin O's gotten a raw deal I Would vote to confirm him you know not a big deal the you know the the guy the guy seems like it up and not be qualified let's let's put this behind us and move

time we had to mix a curriculum you play basketball while you're doing math\nYou you you learn about why you meditate in the morning we have to stay mental health and our programs are back into the uh

believe he's what you're saying don't tear down the stats\nAnd for us that needs to see his family that needs to go out and represent when you have a block leader on every single blocked they can own

may only after\nThat we have a good and the thing that's not worrying about the future all we really\nHave this today we just have the day over and over and over again the eternal return the hero's journey and Trump is on his hero's journey right now and\nHe's not a bus best believe we are going to make America great now the thing is my another thing is we have an issue with the work again and I put my I kept the video doing but I don't work so I'm gonna\nGo all the way things are what ... all we have it now we have today so the word again is that part is because the idea of racism and they ... they it it it hurts us because we need to focus on who we are now today\nI I Believe so actually brought them hats in that have a bit of a transition I'm not ... but you're up there it's a little

other people\nAnd we need to stop working on red and blue is like a gang again that\nAnswer this question there in the oval office has sold ... good energy and and you're going to energy it's good it is it's a great place Jim how do you feel\nGood that are truly feel good too yeah so respected\nAnd what ... doing has been incredible all over the world that talking about this and I have to tell you that important meetings so they were senators and with everything nobody cares they want us is leading isn't limited is that right sooner on those ... coming back to you right after the\nDannemora show\nTo be under oh he said you know what we're having a schedule problem right\nWell they don't want to go under listen they are co equal branch of government he can resist them they haven't subpoenaed him they had a very worrying a perjury trap I\nI I don't know what he's worried about except that he's probably doesn't want the transcripts out there and you know they'll get out\nAnd that's exactly what the problem is I think that's why I was in San doesn't want to do it is that they're being charged with\nSo many of lake it it kind of blow something this big are going to be known because every time that was in the sun meets which one Trump is a lot of confidence in him\nAnd they you know they're not a battle and I either Rosa says China's burn up where he's telling the truth and he's very believable to uh to Trump so let me go into a part of the Trump interview\nAnd where he's talking about a Rosenstein the newness is cutting number for what was going to stop and go here folks\nWe have an insurance policy while the insurance policy is what has gone on for the last fairly long period of time there was tremendous corruption and I'll tell you a lot of these people want to get to the bottom of it and I don't think people like never known as you you should get\nThis alternative like everyone thinks well seven known as should get the medal of honor and she is really what he's gone through and his bravery should get a a a very important and metal label called medal of freedom 'cause we actually given the high orange for civilians and\nHe's he's done an amazing you know guys like meadows isn't and and oh Jim Jordan all of these people what they what they go through and they're right and they can't understand why they're being stymied at so many different levels but\nNow it's coming out and it's really sad I did a great service for this country when I fired call me he was a bad\nGuy with bad intentions and you look at the way out and the one thing just to finish up and that you know the Democrats hated calling me more than any human being he actually did Hillary Clinton that big favorite because she shouldn't be in jail\nBut should they should have taken a write off the campaign buddy ... so he did or a big favor but the Democrats hated call me hated him\nAnd I said the one thing is what I fired him I said I was going to get bipartisan support and you look at humor and all those people they put out a horrible statements about comment you should be fired carries it describes the minute he was fired they came out said he was a wonderful man I said I Can't believe\nIt I Can't believe what they said\nAfter he was hired it was like from a different planet so you know a lot of the politicians what can I tell you\nI'm Glad you brought up firing the kinds of your wife recently had an interview when she said there are people\nMhm uh sorry I missed that I did the wrong one there because did you notice how he was asked a question about Rosenstein and he said I'm surprised that he did and\nThen he turned it immediately to Khomeini and then he was those who don't buy McKay yes and so ... and ... exactly then it was and so he went back to what I Believe he was telling him an inspector general's report and investigation\nAnd I think that's why he did it that way so in other words you I'm I'm I'm kinda suppose you did but then he used to do with me in and basically that gee do I think that's what's going to do\nThat because it again I go back to I think Rosenstein and it probably is that I G report or words as doing it again bugs\nThe first thing ... was only the Hillary Clinton email investigation look mid year review is the goal and the FBI\nWhat Horwitz is now working on what the inspector general is now working on is the beginning of the Russia probe this isn't the Mueller investigation this is one of the campaign still going on the election is yet to happen and struck opens up the Russia investigation on Trump\nThe Carter page and the fog of war and that's what Michael Moore what's the idea is looking at and it will be all these players as my feeling that's probably what Rosenstein knows about and he doesn't want to have to say no comment to Congress or say something that will tip people off because Congress is links like a ...\nBecause this ... this is that they I mean you're talking about taking the deputy out you may be talking about taking the former director out because he went to\nHe went to ... player pretty fast and the nation should tell me for that he he did it pretty fast and so I think the McCabe ... McCabe is saying particularly this stuff is in the Washington Post between ... and Senator McCain today which measure\nThat kind of set up and who's to blame and that um the cave is still going back and said yeah he really did say that\nThen if he goes in and says no I did and it was certainly made up and here's the evidence that they do how do you know and it gives the evidence of it then you kind of blown which will be going on here and there is a grand jury this impaneled oh Mike hey don't you love this\nYes this is so much fun news own enjoyment one yeah most show will be back right after\nThis\n\n[noise]\nAn animal ratio in news Ninety three point one F out to\n\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control centers says is W.

Morris on news talk Ninety three point one W ace easy\n[noise] [noise]\nHe doesn't tuned to do any of this way we're\n\nGoing to\n\nGo back and pick back up with a don't Trump is going to be talking about a Bernie Sanders here\n[noise] [noise]\nI'm Sorry this is Tony Tony clip here current uh let me back it up a little bit\nMidterms so he says Medicare for all the answer what is and you wrote an op ed against it and then he says you miss characterizing what he means what is the biggest obstacle for Medicare for all or something that would give people insurance\nWell let me just tell you that Bernie is the problem with this plan is that you'd have to pay four times the taxes and you're paying right now\nAnd one of the problems you what I was like\nWell he's probably okay with it but nobody else says you'd have no money left I mean that you can go everybody would go out of business you wouldn't be able to do it but maybe as important really I don't think more importantly but as importantly you go and look at countries where they essentially have single payer\n... single payer health care\nIf you look at it and they were disaster they come to our country when they did operations they come into our country when they need help assuming that have the money to do that\nLead the level of services so bad I mean essentially the government runs it you can take a look at what we did at the VA now I have a choice where you're allowed if you have to wait in line for twenty days or be on the air but some of these people are waiting thirty two and forty days to see a doctor\nWhat happens is now under VA choice they're able to go out and get a private doctor we pay the bills\nThat are so happy with what we've done well if you look at Bernie's planned it took a task because basically the government run the government can't run anything they've proven that\nThat was a accident I'd change from Trump is so much better than what it used to be a really ...\n... and ... and communicated\nI'm going to be parents ... whereas when we get there because\nI think it was going to happen to him and income but there's going to have some opposition he's going to I'm a ... and ... and that his opposition primary opposition loses ... we did that you know talked about that and a twenty I'm ...\nAnd I think there's going to he's going to do research at the table here and the Democrats are not going to know what to do with it they're not going to know how to handle him and he is going to be beating them up from stages in bow GM's and if it's a ... like\nI don't think you know even ... I don't think it'll just be the ... on his own stage so excuse me\nSo let's go now to a\nTrump or in the next ... which is very new news ah it ... I'm nowhere near that that is to the Saudi Graham porch and journalists this as interesting\nAs soon as the president I Know one thing has you concern a Jamal console games or a Saturday work in the Washington Post a has disappeared in the Turkish embassy or they have video going in and going out and there's rumors that he's dead\nI heard that a Washington Post reported that you're extremely frustrated with the lack of answers we know that Jared Kushner your son in law's very tight with the crown prince and the crown prince calls the shots in Saudi Arabia your tight with them to want to take to get some answers\nWe're looking at a very very seriously I don't like it at all now you know you don't have American citizens but that in this case doesn't matter I don't like it I don't like it with respect to reporters it's a terrible terrible\nPrecedent we can't let it happen and we're being very tough and we'd have investigators over there and we're working with turkey and frankly we're working with Saudi Arabia we want to find out what happened he\nWent in and it doesn't look like he came out it certainly does it look like he's around once since then and then I came out he relations or [noise]\nBut there's no collusion with the Republicans and there's certainly no collusion with Donald Trump and everyone knows that they ought to get it over with and they ought to save a lot of money and a lot of time\nThat was interesting how we dodged that out there and I can I can see things going down this way the midterms happen you pick up seats in the Senate which is your confirmation group here and if you're if you're at fifty three are higher than I think\nYou get it done because you don't have the John McCain's into plagues and the the course of the world and you have a much more conservative in general a group\nHere and I could see them than him picking somebody is going to be pretty easy to get to the Senate as the\nAs a new attorney general and just tell the demographic to sit down and shut up and\nThen he can buy with um oh okay well just because he I think he's got explosives to with the G ... report and other things that are coming out that he knows he's got to do is make it through in the mid term and the question is will someone to come out before the midterm\nWill know in the ... the owners of time so with that maybe you know jump\nOver here to a new news who was a home Hannity last night and he's going to be talking about what was in ... in a no show\nRod Rosenstein this is the guy that recommended the fiery or call me as a guy that appointed Mueller signed the final buys a\nWarrant application the third renewal and this is a guy that Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker congressman all say talked about wearing a wire against President Trump in the hopes of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment or he owes us answers to that\nHe owes us answers he's not coming tomorrow which I think should be very telling story is that he find possibly wanted to come and have a cup of coffee was chairman Goodlatte [noise]\nThat's not acceptable he needs to come and testify under oath\nIf you look at the story tonight Sean it's breaking in the Washington Post who have\nBoth McCain and Rosenstein fighting over what happened at the time of when he wanted to wear a wire whether or not he wanted to wear a wire [noise] uh\nAnd and who was responsible for what so clearly\nWhat that says this is the investigators\nNo one to investigate them\nAnd they're running amok\nAmok Caroline my I had a wanting to fight a Congress that's pretty pathetic\nPretty pathetic and these guys are perplexed but it's like so Rosenstein toaster trip and he said I'm going to surprise you didn't do it but\nI think I think we're on the right track on this thing or what do you think we are the question is gonna be timing of this and there's there's something\nCome out between now in the mid term so I always felt that it would but\n... and I think the Democrats going into politics but yeah\nBut it's there and is there than it needs to go down so\nNew Years is going to continue on with this and um there were ... or war in ...\nThey both arguing over who should have recused himself frankly both of them should have\nI didn't need the classify and send out the other were directed\nBy the application is the bulk of which the information came from the ... say that Hillary paid for and the ... and the fraud on the Pfizer court where are those the classified documents that the president said he really is where are the three O'Toole between Christopher ... Bruce or\nHold the same thing is true Sean\nThe same people who are arguing tonight on the pages of the Washington Post whether or not which ones should recused themselves right so this was over a year ago when the special counsel was appointed they're supposedly arguing in front of Miller who should be recused and like you said they both should have been recused\nThose same people were at least the deputy attorney general who will not come to Congress to testify under oath\nIs the same person who was blocking the American people from being able to see this information that we in the Congress have been asking for now a couple of months for the president they classify the president actually said\nI Want this immediately the classified\nWithout reductions\nAnd then shortly after that the deputy attorney general convenes that meeting to convince the president well we need to have the I'd say look at this and that's where we stand right now with the ... and\n... I don't think we need an allergy report shot I I think it's ... I think it's ridiculous Sean I agree and you know I Do I agree with you okay I I don't have a problem with that gee I Want this stuff declassified\nI went to the stuff to kind of ... and he does ... ... ... but\nThere's ... what is the reason he's always been kind of thought to that it was because of embarrassment of the day oj\nI just don't think that that's the case I don't think known Trump would put up with stuff of when he ... he had been asked to do something when it did it and then somebody said sure there's where we can't do that the ... were compromised investigation combination of both\nBut this is um this is an interesting by this habit in here\nAnd there there was only there is no good reason to do this unless you've got something incredibly explosive there's about to hit the solution to noon is again talking about the dogs\nI agree wholeheartedly and frankly ... a real special cows ought to be a point in the FBI Director saying today he wanted to say whether or not the president as being wiretapped today are you kidding me\nI mean yeah I don't know\nThat question goes a little different directions but\nLet's just go back to the main point here that we need we really need to know at the start of\nProsecutor special counsel\nOn remember people are losing sight of is\nChief investigators at the time\nOf Trump campaign colluded with Russia [noise]\nAnd so why do we have a special counsel in the first place [noise]\nThis looks like Lisa ... is that they had nothing in nine months so they started the meeting league strategy so they can create the atmosphere is something that never took place it is outrageous\nIs having headphones but getting a new city or the whole point of it and um [noise]\nNew news is getting a little bit but I Am also a ... but I think that we there is a reasoning behind it that really is is that why one um\nLet me kind of go into another subject here they catch him and here's another report in Douma U.S officials warned about cyber attack there were at this was a box\nIs now the number one counterintelligence threat to the U.S and is waging an aggressive effort to try to shape viewers\nThe top security officials who testified today on Capitol Hill cyberattacks now exceed the risk of\nPhysical attacks ministry official told a Senate panel that's a ... threat is challenging habit high tech hacking is worse viral spread a volatile malware has reached the pandemic stage with the midterms looming the homeland security secretary said\nBeijing wants to swing voters without tampering at the ballot box we have not seen to date any Chinese attempt to compromise election infrastructure the FBI directory expanded on the new threats from China saying they are now more significant than those posed by Vladimir Putin's government\nRussia is in many ways [noise] fighting to stay relevant after the fall of the Soviet Union they're fighting today's fight or China's fighting tomorrow's fight\nThe cyber threat assessment is sobering because the anti I drink to testify radicalization continues to grow on line and a dangerous rate\nFor currently investigating about five thousand terrorism cases across America and around\nThousand of those cases are homegrown violent extremists and they're an all fifty states on\nThe bureau's handling of Dr Christine Blasey Ford sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh re weighed in publicly for the first time and confront the White House set the terms\nAre are supplemental update to the previous back on the situation was limited in scope and that that is consistent with the standard process for such investigations going back quite a long ways\nOn Senate Democrats pressed on the White House counsel did anyone in your agency receive any direction about the scope of the investigation directly from Don McGahn\nMy understanding is that the communications occur between the White House office of security and the security to us\nIn a separate development Fox News has told the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein will not appear on Capitol Hill Thursday to answer questions about allegations he just got secretly recording the president there isn't the impasse over the terrorists with some lawmakers pushing for and transcribe interview versus a briefing with no paper trail\n\nSo that he or she shared a little bit of the Rosenstein piece of that but the um what we're doing is we're moving but everybody's been talking to Russia hacking to now we're getting into a bar is tack it in China and that they're actually playing around with some elections to boso\nSo that is another interesting choice because everybody's given trip a hard time and he's talking about it is now just Russia is there are others that are there to the oh would you want to admit that is Russia there was any way but one they're more show will be back right after this [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] from\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center says is W.

like I Know I have a you know\nI just finished an awful lot of new we're friends and I think that\nUm that he just he is in\nThe ... situation with that with the ... and I think that Trump folk portrayed in both the owners would not be happening if it were if sessions has recused himself\nI think if we played against Kentucky a next coming weeks or or any other week would be to do is I think we're on the roller defense is starting to play together yeah but when I was gonna I called about that ah\nLet me let me ask you something before you asked me a question are you willing to commercial yeah man selling so you ... you can get autograph maybe you are you are so much for a new a store\nAnd three times I was in there I was in the first one or assisting the customer and pointing and not in in the background and then heading keys over\nI like that yeah that was a pretty sharp there huh I Know I don't know I only been ringing off the compound it 'cause I was offered a baseball bat there you don't go Hillary that though he'll get mad when I was in your manager that well you know that\nSaudi Arabians story I mean my dad used to always tell me you know there's this person had openly criticize the royal family and then he has his desk or fortitude to physically go over into a country where he is really disrespected\nThe royalty family and then he expects to end up disappearing\nYou just don't do stuff like that then it's like those that sometimes when you do things are like for example a windows Fitch owners or they had the GPS and there were a mountain climbing in North Korea they accidentally crossed over the border yeah and they ended up doing hard time labor\nOr if I Would have been GPS and hiking any mountains I Would have made sure I'm least ten twenty miles from that border there's consequences for your actions you know and he just I think you just you know you know and you're openly like that I wouldn't have gone over what was his purpose of going over there\nDan or her he was trying to get some paperwork so he could get uh\nSomething up without putting out what it was but I'm not here saying though because he's a journalist and say bad things about the whole family that you know him the ability and the way to learn to move on but he says\nNo I'm just I'm just I've learned from my father when he used to tell me that sometimes when you do things you know you just don't know it's like me showing up at a democratic a\nCampaign function I I don't think that would be happy that'd be like a Democrat gone to a gun show and and openly saying I'm against a I'm pro gun control there's some things you just don't do it if you know there's going to be trouble heading that way my dad he's just said you know there's trouble down their kids but those kids while you're going down the street and hanging out with him\nOh go look for trouble\nAnd that's what that's what he did by physically going over there and openly say something that I think I mean you went over there than I've been to Saudi Arabia I've been to Riyadh and I'd never had any problems\nBut then again I I watch my piece in queues have remembered and I went by their rules and the air force ladies there had to wear the right clothing and had to go by the rules they couldn't drive ins in fetch items you know so and don't they have a new progress so I'm kind of prince now too I mean these are driving now\nIt is but he's the guy losing the game the command to uh to have him what\nI said that sounds that sounds kinda strange sort of a guy who who's who's trying to bring the country back into the twenty first century on the world platform by you know doing all these things for women's rights\nThat sound like the kind of person that would do that\nWell we assume right well it's you know we're doing to someone who's a known yesterday talking about this and he basically said you know there is now in his mind there's no way this could have been dome without his command\nRight\nI totally believe that too but there's even some places I remember we used to have a security Saudi security police when we went from on base inflation to another base insulation while Ron on Saudi Arabia there's some there's some bad spots any you have to be careful where you go in and where you stop in breakdown and stuff like that\nUm so I I really I mean I feel physically bad if something did happen to that person but we don't know that it's all legit right\nYeah there's not there's not any hard evidence habit but there seems to be a lot of you know the fact that he went in but they have produced a tape of him coming out yeah I've been enough embassies or maybe our cameras everywhere\nYeah I remember when I was in ... in Riyadh the embassy their makeshift when they had over there during the show Desert Storm and ah there's cameras everywhere you're right I mean there's the curious so ties unbelievable\nYou can't you can't see somebody come in and not go out [noise] but I I just kind of shocked at that prince would do that and that he was getting all these accolades and the public or you know audience and everything and then the turnaround

know mhm\nTrump would have been perfectly within his rights to stick to show up as you say you're fired true\nSo it sounds to me like the president is a step ahead on this one is playing you know to

yeah\nBecause\nThe deep state is much bigger than elected officials and people that are particular party yes radiology or did not Trump reference gold global is in this interest rate thing\nI I tell you people need to understand that these so called deep state whatever you want to call them they will stop at nothing\nTo get things back the way they have him go in because you know ... they didn't expect any of this I didn't expect Trump ... none of this was supposed to come to we never supposed to have known any that's about the FBI\nAny of this stuff if Hillary had one would probably be in World War three with Russia Russia by now we weren't supposed to know any of this and I think they will do anything and that includes assassinating the president that includes starting a war they will do whatever they have to do in power\nI was quite frankly proud of Rand Paul for using a word yeah is that if they don't stop this somebody's going to get assassinated and almost tap into debt

down [noise]\nThat is the balloon in Hollywood being present it as a new survey\nSays most of America get care less\nTaylor Swift recently stepped into it and of all places Tennessee which outside of Nashville is pretty conservative [noise] uh once again raise this this whole issue so this\nPoll asking two thousand one hundred Ninety two adults sixty percent said they're not interested in the political and social opinions of they're celebrities whose music or shows and movies they enjoy\nSo even if there are a fan they don't want to know I like Taylor Swift until Tuesday\nUm [noise] about one in five people are interested\nBut only one in ten are interested enough to where it may sway their opinion and who they're going to vote for\nAgain six out of ten people said they do not learned about news and current events through celebrities but thirty percent doing that would explain below photos and\nWell that's weird because she stayed out of it during the election the presidential election she landmark kept one reason like her just stay yeah you know work so well is quit doing them\nIn your career has been phenomenally successful and now\nAnd I would daresay that uh the the typical Taylor Swift fan is probably somewhat conservative think so um [noise]\nYou live now told them or insulted them that they're idiots if they do anything but vote the way you suggest 'cause you're terrified you're a hundred year out it's just about a billionaire and you're terrified of Marsha Blackburn you've got bigger problems than the big mountains\nBecause whatever happens you certainly have the resources to survive just about any situation um one in five say they've an followed a celebrity on social media because of their views\nFor out of ten said when celebrities express their opinions it's not at all effective in influencing them Seventeen percent maybe and full ... percent of people said it's very effective seven percent\nSo do you want to risk you're standing in the entertainment world do you want to risk the relationship with the fans you've cultivated over many years by opening a mouth and offering an opinion that either insults them or as virulently opposite of what they believe\nFrom your Hollywood high ground it's probably not a good idea\nAnd by the way the distribution of respondents was forty percent Republican thirty six Democrats twenty four percent independent\nAnd so finally we at least have concrete proof if you can take a poll that value that ah they've all got something to say the wrong you know\nBut you know stay off your

in Florida\nWhen her co workers found out that she had cancer should be going through chemo or friends went out and gathered about seven or eight hundred bucks and bought her an incredibly beautiful wood oh wow but\nThere was a blockbuster that she just could not accepted and chose rather to do it my mom did it was more convenient and more comfortable I guess she wore the scarves the scar\nAnd

I'm not familiar with ... the musician so that that\nWas that was cool felt like I uh\nI I was in touch with someone like you know maybe me in a in a different dimension or something like that a ... universe musician\nYeah I I didn't know them until today I I honestly just you know I Know of your work obviously can get to meet you at that conference in Atlanta and you know ... when I first discovered you but I was like let's let's get Nicholas day why not\nAnd a looper is the composer came up I like his music is kind of funky puts me in a good mood\nI Know there's um there's another loop for as well I think is a like a professional wrestler yes\nUm yeah so that would often come up like on the uh you know if I'd Google myself and I'll be there be a constant reminder that I'm not a wrestler\n[laughter] and I wish I was I've I've been on the kick lately but ... was a a store and then do viewing WCW during the eighties\nSo oh in the in the eighties eighties and nineties um so I mean that was on high watermark for wrestling but that was the WWF so it was a whole Khamenei a brother\nAnd I wasn't really any way\nAnd you know last time I Google my name I think what came up with an M in may fighter Joey the sandman Clark like show me the\nSan ... will get that\nSaying that the that's a great nickname that's pretty good and then when I Googled my best friend's name a Troy and I'm not going to give out his last name and it was a gay porn star it's like you know that's\nI Believe that I I think most I think most male names or could probably be like a gay porn star there's ... there's got to be able to ...\nUh you know keep on start we ... so I just hope that he just won't be as good at it you know right on it you know if somebody Google's my name and then they come across as a game on or how long it'll be awesome you know so we you know they might be surprised if taken aback but at least\nUm you know the guy they're confused before is good and his ...\n... exactly I mean I Hope if anybody takes and enjoy clerk and starts to do gay porn that you knew your point is well taken I I Want it to be impressive even if you're not indicating poor you're like wow I I was just a little longer\n[noise] yeah I ... a lot of ah you know just like respect the person ... respect the person on the art you know like there's\nLike I don't understand ... ... I don't I mean you have to be like they say there's a there's\nA level where you can appreciate jazz but then there's a level like about understanding that's just you know sort of um you know out there and I'm just I'm not there but uh\nI selling so is the is a fantastic you know jazz and that's all I respect that writing reading I guess with whether the person the top or a bottom hope they're good at it\nYeah they're really making some shapes their yeah whether on the keyboard or in the bedroom I'm so Lou\nA you know hitting the funny bone or as opposed to like hey that guy onstage agrees with me um but it is you know but it is it is a ballot because I think in in speaking with Germany about it and I think he he wrote about it too there has to be you know some point of commonality with your ... where you know where they are with you\nUm and then um you know they're willing to you know go along for the ride\nUm so ... finding that balance is um you know is it is a challenge or sometimes if what you're doing is you know political stuff and um and you run the risk of you know playing to the point to the\nThe room as opposed to you know you know going for the funding or what what would you think um\nWhat what do you what you think or whatever your goal\nOr Oh absolutely and I actually uh I found that these men Kato and bound and it's great um I'd I'd worry that there's all these conversations going on to like ... and you brought it up in your piece what is the role of comedy under Trump I really liked your response\nOr [laughter] or like something like what the F was his under Obama then right where it would seems to me what's the role of comedy will still make people laugh I don't know like ... sometimes I politics over you know makes it a little too\nComplicated and there's nothing wrong with being a political comedian um some of my favorite comedians or political comedians Lewis Black\nOr though everybody has an off day and it it's the\nUh comedy itself is really started to fascinate me like the process like I've always enjoyed it like a good stand up for ... sketch comedy\nOf improv but I've started it as a more radios and think about how does the process what is it like for the people and you don't just sit there going to make me laugh funny man it's like oh no that's ... persons all these anxieties and that's going to be one of the toughest jobs\nIn the world and to that point I remember thinking the Lewis black's one of the funniest guys ever and he came here to Montgomery to our theater and uh he just sat up there and read the newspaper and yell and scream it didn't really have any jokes constructed like when\nYou really it really read the newspaper\nHe really at the newspaper ... any I think it was right after Trump is gets the nomination so he was just cannot around it which\n[noise] uh no yeah we just kind of his you know we just kind of thing yeah\nYou know there ... there was a you could tell he was still working on is our I'm ... I'm interested in the process that you go through with weave the Internet [noise] I'd imagine I mean I think you've talked about how it's low hanging fruit out there if you just search on social media\nBut what was kind of the general idea when we the Internet first started up was that what your approach would\nBe um well I I um I didn't start uh obey the Internet so I came on as they are as a freelancer oh actually and um so I produce I think it was five videos to start with\nAnd I'm I'm you know those five videos or you know available or on a on YouTube and\nFacebook and people can find them and um I think the you know the basic idea was to make a you know a\nPolitical comedy channel that takes on all sides you know that is you know sort of followed the equal opportunity offender or ...\nAs you with the with you know for example like South Park was a really great job ah with it and um so\nSo I you know I've I've I've really enjoyed that um that aspect of it and that's the thing that I find is\nStuff that sort of like depending on which video of ours someone sees first from that one video they'll make all these sanctions about where we\nWhere we fall and all these other uh all these other issues um so you know there's like a whole line up I'm like if someone calls us like either you has just you know stupid conservatives but it's like okay I'm In my head I'm like okay that person probably saw this video this study on this video\nAnd then immediately I started thinking of well people who think that we're liberals\nProbably saw this video the studio and the city so it it it's fun to um to confuse people in in that way um where it's like oh man I stayed with you guys are making fun of both sides or or um I Can't believe the same you know people who came out with a burglar for gun control\nCame out with this other one making fun of people who opened care you know\nReally well in this so you hop into the Internet and on on a little bit because I've shared a lot of videos and I I see that what you're talking about what the reaction for people who follow me and my audience out here on the radio\nThat there are certain ones that are really playing the other ones were they look at it and go away whereas this coming from and it's um it's weird to me that\nEven like it's one thing to put out like a stand up a bit or a comedy Internet cannot video sketch\nIt's another thing when it's just a funny moment like a ... stupid silly human moment like the other day Trump's walking up air force one there's toilet paper or something on his foot\nIt's funny and I share it and a few people react like summer like oh that dumb ass he's ruining the country others are saying oh there goes the media pointing out the unimportant things to make hay shut up just funny\nAnd interesting on comedy becomes a bit of a Rorschach test in this day and\nOh yeah well I well I find it I Will but I find really interesting too is um\nYou know it it seems like so many people bring to what you've created their you know they they bring to it their own or their own ideology and they project onto it off and what's already in their ... you know so they start seeing things that you're like I didn't I didn't in that I don't know what you're I don't know what you're talking about\nUm so that you know that could make or\nOh you know don't take what you actually made um\nAnd what they're responding to are these sort of you know delusions are these invention\nAbout you know wondering you know wondering where you're coming from like hey you make if I if you know when we make fun of Trump it's like oh why you got like Hillary supporters is that why and it's like no because we thought\nThis was a funny idea and we looked around and no one else did this idea so we're like a cool is make it in and see what happens um there there aren't you know these you know evil you know sort of scheming\n\nThat we're going to test on more you know we're gonna we're part of the resistance or or or any other thing like we just want to make um we just wanna make funny stuff\nThat entertaining and we hope gets people talking and you know hopefully we can use comedy as a way to break down so many of the laws that have been built up around people that they're not willing to talk to each other\nUm anymore and it's a um you know the the divisiveness of politics as a as a real thing and I'm I'm a unfortunately you know I look around the front them the ship like man that's a overtaken that la\nLa shared a a video about what about Islam\nThe what about guy out that and I had a few it reminded me several people in my life and I love them dearly but ah [laughter] yeah and I I like that it's you defend somebody because they're your guy\nUm I mean then that's where I I listen to a lot of people where they come from and I'm sort of check to myself again where I'm I'm even got tired of like libertarian back and forth on social media it's just it's too much you know I Want to get back to that in a second I like I especially what I'm saying is I Want to make fun of libertarians here in a second\nBut I'm the one main reason I invite you on tonight looper as\nIt's not to tell people that they should go subscribe to the Internet on YouTube or Greg and Lou on YouTube within you know like the new venom movie then that just made great stuff that's not why I brought you out\nThere is some video you made about two months ago\nAnd uh and you ... [laughter] it's a it was in my dreams in one I'm going to be done and over there was a nightmare like what the hell was the sheep all thing man [laughter] that's how you\nWant to do on it that you tell your audience or can you describe what you saw in the uh in the people that are you\nFolks it was a guy in white face number one um was it looked like a painted on it it looked like a Half Men have sheep\nAre and then I saw on the outside of the video I saw some posts where it was just the man's head was a sheep and then he looked like a regular man [laughter] like as synch outlet you describe the video actually cause that freaked me out too much man you'd votes everything club and\n[noise] ... it was um uh so we were I was playing with the idea of a when you're on line and you know often you'll\nHear the youth of the word cheap being thrown around or people talking about the quote unquote cheap all of those who you know blindly follow whatever you know the mainstream says or whatever the official story is and um\nI just took it to a literal level bubble man that would be pretty offensive to to an actual half ... half sheep ... and uh and there and and and there are of the grace of God a Barry there's a Barry Ramsey a literal she was born and he had a message\nDon't drink coffee don't drink when you're doing yoga is the one\nEight eight eight of ... or is it is a good amount there's definitely a good amount of during last night I had a a I share to a couple of bottles of wine with a two other dude and I'm I'm I was pretty it was pretty lit up and I was a man on during ended up anymore\nThat's good I think that's always the uh um I I I don't think I've ever met someone where am I only they shouldn't drink more [laughter] I don't think I've ever given that advice\nThat are in a little and it's weird because you know I'm actually blacked out before and it makes me think of the Kavanaugh hearings where I was like I Know he's trying to be a Supreme Court justice and this is a very serious hearing\nAbout very serious issues and not just the the theater of it are the political posturing but like he should be very serious but when one senator asked them essentially have you ever blacked out\nThe answer it needed to be senator I Can't recall it like please Kavanaugh said that\nThat would have been perfect but no no\n... yeah you know I didn't I didn't follow that that\nWhole ah have the as closely as other people um I felt like I uh I might have been a bike too emotionally attached to it yeah um you know from from hearing I think a lot of had to do with you hearing stories from women in my life\nUm and I think that that might you know just sort of\nI I Would have to recuse myself from I'm from really getting into a into the the the discussion but I Know from my own experience\nI'm drinking you know in my early twenties like\nAnd if there were times when I was trying to access where I'd been blackout\nThat I you know done something terrible that you know\nTrying to run reconnaissance and talk with my body like hey I'm the only thing I find like you know and and thankfully you know I you know nothing you know crazy crazy happened but that was definitely a point in my life when I\nWhen I said look I just can't do this I don't I don't want to be in that scary positioning more where\nYou lose control of what you're doing you know and that and you know blacking out or what it is or whatever you know um whatever you've done a lot like by the way to get a you know they get out of it so\nMuch better it is not drink assurance that early definitely not drink that much\nWell and not owned or that if you if you grow yourself definitely don't do that and I you know I've been there and I mean for a short period in my life a few years I I did it on purpose in the sense of I was not a happy person um but you know I'd I'd sort of change that I Know that feeling of you\nDidn't actually do anything with the next morning like how did I get here oh my God who do I need to apologize to that's just a horrible feeling to be walking around with at least for a day or two of yeah losing your mind in that sense um it's yeah\nYeah and then you know just just you know thinking about it and you know in regards to you know alcohol compared to other\nOther drug that that are out there um it is pretty incredible that\nUm you know I was able to go through that experience in my life with a legal drug and you know find the you know the wherewithal to you know take control of my life again and say I'm not going to do that and at no point that I Need\nA you know the criminal justice system to step in to make sure that I made the right choice [laughter] you know um whereas with you know I Wish that\nYou know I Wish that that that same at the same thing can be said for you know other drugs that are that people consume but you know they're doing it in a way where you know they don't\nFeel a free enough to uh you know talk about it or they're doing it sort of in the in the shadows and and if they want help they're unable to to get it because you know fear of what my you know come come to them well\nAnd the um the stigma of it and you know I I heard just did one on bravo Kevin ... tell me your voice and I'm not going to pry but I've also people uh confide in me too and when I watch those hearings\nIf it was a little too much for me and when I Do is on I'll I'll play like the the Rick side of my brain from the ... show like well via would this will be cynical and just make jokes and\nAnd whatever but when I when I watch the series of did strike me reminded me some people I Know my life who I've said this happened to me and I I've been told many people\nUm it's just it's real tough in the same thing goes and I'm Talking about sexual assault abuse rape but also people I Know been addicted to the horn drugs and they're trying to figure out what to do with their life\nAnd there's they can't they feel like they talk about it or they have to do it in hushed tones or else they'll all come down on the number one or nobody will listen to them and kind of push them further into that dark corners terrible place to be\nAnd maybe it's something changed with the laws but also um the culture at large to very difficult\n\nVery difficult well I mean I Know that's a great no to start off on before you go into a comedy show\nSo I'll be happy to help you there LOU LOU are you there\nAnd then there are now okay um yeah it's been a problem with my with my headphones or move around when I when I say I don't know if you if you're caught it I I've definitely had to follow some tough facts or before so this wouldn't be the uh wouldn't be the first time a ... but one thing that I Want one thing about that I definitely\nWant what struck me about you know the Kavanaugh stuff was you know if there was ever a time where arguing on Facebook was not going to help anybody it was definitely um you know\nIt was definitely having to do with this case because whether you were for\nWas if you you know a supporter you know Brett Kavanaugh or you um you know or supported or Dr Ford\nI'm ever going to go see the doctor supportive for you know\nCreeping onto somebody else or or you know Fred and contradicting them in any manner where you're not going to go over well and I saw you know so many people who like blow up with with this animosity and uh and it was like man you guys just putting yourself something that\nThat you don't have to put yourself through um that you know that these are these conversations are I Believe much better had um a face to face you know or group of friends or something like that um but of course I mean they are uh you know I mean there are a lot of the pieces that came out I think we're in Port ...\nAs well in that I mean it that is a good sense of perspective is and it brings me back to the\nUh the personal aspect of things like you actually talk with your family and friends about these issues I mean unfortunately I think some people find\nMaybe they're in it I don't know maybe their dad or their mom is they disagree politically it's a shame to see relationships are broken by different political ideas um well somebody's actually of whom are violent person I don't really see\nI I think this is why I Love your ah your hate s idea um those genius which just screw our way out of our disagreements um but it's a matter of perspective and having a those personal discussions in a in a sensitive a way and\nUm I guess ... here in just a second I Want to let you go but folks follow Lou and or the whole team there we the Internet or you to\nJust go to YouTube subscribe you know how it works if you don't know how it works well I Can't help you but go to we the Internet TV on YouTube are also check out Greg and Lou and are there a few moments here LOU LOU we're um we're talking over each other\nAnd uh I was feeling the tension [laughter] really
