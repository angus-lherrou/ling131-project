I was riding with his hand out and he's he's so he's so you know and his own right is perfect right to do that yeah\nSo what you really looking for is living and managing and making it not having it took away from me that a lot of people have this big mistake and you should but you need to know how to manage that but getting back to Medicare wide as easy to come in tangled in the many different finance\nMatter if your plan doesn't address your health aides and your health concerns that we've talked about going to the doctor and hospital as to what we didn't talk about it especially if you're tired or retired\nOr did they say that one\nI guess as to why I wouldn't go there [laughter]\nAs much is going to cost you to stay so healthy right okay\nHaving a comprehensive and affordable health insurance strategy as a mouthful words ... is more than just a critical component in your retirement plan or your retirement history your future is a critical component in the quality of your life in other words\nHow you're being taken care of your not being harassed for like thousands of dollars when you just went into a hospital or will you be has the other side of the coin that we're going to talk about\nThere are many different ways to accomplish this but for many retirees Medicare is the most important one why because it's their health insurance plan ... how many people struggle to pay for health insurance premium now\nOr do things like don't retire don't retire at a certain age because their wife has to continue having insurance right it's a big saying\nObamacare it was a big thing in probably a bad thing Trump care we don't know what that is yeah common we're waiting for that trumpet this spout out waiting for that car on the Trump trying to come through the station we're waiting for it to see what it's going on there but according to the Medicare fast\nFacts Medicare ... guarantees health insurance for people older than sixty five that means sixty five in one second okay or whatever\nAnd or if you have certain disabilities are if you had certain diseases then you can be took care of under the disability part of it affects also of the nearly fifty one million Americans who worm is Medicare recipients\nAre in two thousand twelve\nAnd or an automated delivery truck would bring it out to be the time saving thing yeah\nOne day the farmer we're plowing and ran up on some big tree roots yeah\nSo he pulled up the ad type dance and Michel ... and he hit send and he waited a few minutes later the automated delivery truck pulled up stop\nAnd out of the back tumbles a shovel oh that's neat so he digs up his roots and he he goes about his business and a few minutes later he comes up on this huge rock yeah right after in the middle of field yeah so he pulls up that tops and send me a ... yeah you hit send and waited\nA few minutes later the automated delivery truck pulled up stop not back\nTumbled ... wonderful well you know he's getting his work done you know using this new happen every time\nA few minutes later he pulls up on these weeds we'd bunch of these large weeds you know the roots go way down here in the news you just pull 'em up you wouldn't get all up and see what he did is he got that ... he taught and send me a whole there and he hit a button sand and we waited\nA few minutes later the truck pulls up stops and Stormy Daniels falls out\nOh no [laughter] than the money they could be got it all across them there'd be but uh you know some people might like that on on everywhere you know yeah\nI don't have any sense [laughter]\nMaybe they got it all ... I gotta feeling a lot more politicians know her than we're worried than we know don't you think I can imagine and they should be thinking about this Medicare and Social Security not that knows them yeah they had to be thinking about us and and the stuff that they're thinking about uh you know\nMedicare Medicare is something that every body needs to know about\nOtherwise you might get a shock\nYeah ... this fall out that you don't walk by on the truck and you don't I don't think that\nThere's portions of the Medicare to which most working Americans are automatically entitled to\nOnce they turn sixty five years old and then that part's a NBA is automatic for anyone who is sixty five years old and already receiving Social Security so that's pretty cool\nUh our railroad benefits diagnosed with a a Las ... also known as Lou Gehrig's disease are under age sixty five and receiving disability then you're automatically enrolled for individuals in times of the matter is that stupid word again\nTo Medicare but who are not eligible for automatic enrollment because they don't trigger that qualifying event in other words they couldn't order that truck\nTo bring him something they can sign up for the original Medicare Darren in Rome appeared and that is a a period of time that they have\nTo get it done if they don't get it done they lose they if you don't use it you lose it I guess is what it what it boils down to it so you you end up with a light penalty for the feed at least if you don't do that and take things\nBut what I was talking about a little earlier about this was that a lot of the stuff is done\nAnd the average the duck to build in two thousand Fifteen\nWas one thousand two hundred and sixty dollars per hospital admission that is a lot of money yeah well it is we get this man you just pay zero for the next sixty days that's pretty cool right oh yeah but came to be sicker than sixty days you can be yeah guess what happened to those turkeys\nI got I don't know if I Want to guess or not you tell me they had to pay three hundred and Fifteen dollars a day from day sixty one so you're Ninety but that ain't the end of it it gets worse it do\nAfter the nine ... day period Medicare all of a sudden get really tired of ... ... they like they don't even want to know who you are\n... and they decide that they just only gonna let you stay there if you give somebody six hundred and thirty dollars a day six hundred and thirty dollars a day after Ninety Days yeah and you might not have more than six hundred and thirty dollars or maybe twelve hundred Fifteen hundred or two thousand a month coming in\nSo many days you're going to be able to stay it's looking like a slim choice there I mean you know and and you know God Forbid somebody had to do that but there are folks I have a friend\nWho has who Bush has already passed away but he was in a hospital\nI Know it was over a hundred days yeah so this would've applied to him I guess yeah yeah and so the thing about it is\nYou need to know if you just have regular Medicare you need to know you may be staying in ... some quick saying some dangerous ground you could change that now a lot of people say well I've got Blue Cross Blue Shield [noise]\nDo you really\nMade me you got to shield but maybe you don't have the complete coverage maybe you got a partial maybe you've got something it'll just compliment up to a certain amount you get to know what you have knowledge is power because what\nIf you did save some money in your little retirement account guess who is having to pay for these medical expenses because you didn't know ahead of time these problems who may\nI don't even feel sick or where they are more sick I Would you might get sick or if you hear more of it is yeah I'm telling you is kind of depressing really they can be very but very depressed thing is you got to suck it up even though it's depressing and find out about it so when the time comes you don't get caught short\nAnd what you need to do is call three three four two seven nine seven four three one talked to my man David ours he'll tell you all about it\nYeah what we like to do is compliment this with your retirement plan this is just something that we kind of educate you for our own\nAnd if you're already have Medicare is not something that we can also talk about in other words it's never too late right it's always something we can do I'll give you an example\nThere are programs and we don't sell them but we can help you find them we used to sell them but there's just so so much to the person can do so so there's no conflict of interest here we we don't work for Medicare we don't work for Social Security we are your person if you bring us than\nWe do work with you and your on your retirement plan\nBut we will work with you to make sure that your retirement plan does not get eaten alive by your Medicare problems because what good is that financial people lack for you to keep the money 'cause how do they make money because you kept your exactly if you lose your money that doesn't mean\nThat does you know good is basically does you know good but it doesn't do me any good either so I'm In the ... ... ... ... I'm In the boat\nOf the back of the truck now [laughter] but there is something we can sticks and chewing gum in there or something to try to get that thing plugged up\nSo that we can stop this problem that you may have in the future that your Social Security and Medicare get eat a lot because you get too sick\nNow what can we do well the simplest thing to do is for us to look at Medicare Advantage plans a lot of people don't know but\nI think Medicare Medicare ... there are insurance companies there are medical companies UAB is one of the University of Alabama in Birmingham has a program called viva vi V. A. which is a good what\nBlue Cross Blue Shield has one called blue advantage that's a good point and United healthcare has one and I don't know what it's called I guess you know I have health care but it's a good one [laughter]\nThey're all good and they're all they they got their shortfalls and they're good stuff but the good stuff about him is that they'll pay more usually\nIf you get sick they may even pay a lot more if you get sick instead of running out of steam like regular Medicare and ended the beauty of it it does it cost you pay me to get enrolled in it broke with\nThe government pays for it the government pays one hundred and ten percent unless it's been change of what the average expense is on a Medicare recipients to the company and for that a hundred and ten percent of average ... they take\nThe complete loss when a hundred and ten percent that means that I Would pay\nHow much zero what a minute\nMeeting in certain counties you mean something actually the government's got something to do with is going to be beneficial to me\nYes and it was a Republican a bill or course it was it was not a Democrat that did this I won't pay the Republicans but to give just like they put the drug plan together the thing is that what this does is it contracts\nWith the insurance companies are the medical institutions like you would be to take care of you\nAnd they may charge you a little bit per month or they may charge you nothing and it has to be with competition like in the in the county Montgomery there's so many doctors so many hospitals that are competing against each other they won't ask you to pay any extra except you co pays like you might have to pay\nYou know five dollars or twenty dollars or thirty dollars to go see your doctor that kind of stuff yeah but ... and you get into other you know ... gaps like in your medical opinion you're drug plan you but the thing is if you don't have\nAnd it can listen to Michael who has a finger on the pulse of what's happening in this mid term cycle Michael it's great to talk to you I think the Democrats made a huge miscalculation\nAnd embracing these caravans of people who want to storm the border I think most people from all walks of life life across this country fine now this is all a bridge too far\nIt is and I got to tell you I saw that Chris ... a prime time last night student Cortez as a warrior\n... for the president he really is you know he he's a Latino in his ... his parents\nCame here legally and he in doors so much for printing the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I looked at the model he I Know when I get on CNN after defending the president\nI get so many friends some of them death threats I'm certain game gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him and your um ... ... the Democrat signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living\nTrying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools they're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much on to this president's leadership\nAnd then on the other side they see chaos identity politics\nConstant cries of racism or embracing illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been the case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders its it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up and the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue in actually pass legislation to stop this this is an emergency what's happening to this country\nCan learn from our bureau in coming toward the border and I think the president is standing tall you know I I\nI've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met last\nBack during the Reagan years and you know I worked for Jack Kemp and and it was people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country and and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump it happened back\nOn and would never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh and you saw what happened\nWhen the president just said simply no I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve an income\nAnd the senators we didn't even think Adam anymore we Lindsey Graham was a hero\nOn chairman Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates from the strength in the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down that stairway in Trump Tower\nAnd then his speech which shocked everyone he promised starts the word and they started to conflate like you mentioned\nUh illegal immigration with immigration and they tried to do that\nOver and over and over again and they're still doing it today\nBut it's not working because the average man and woman working every day in America you know taking their lunch buckets of work you know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumped the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health the radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been down in the last few years on immigration are shows that most people want legal immigration either to remain the same\nAnd that's a million people here it's a lot or or to be decreased so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain as saying that the Gallup poll from June I'm thirty seven percent want the level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration\nTwenty nine percent want it decreased okay twenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration\nAnd those are the convenience factor the inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration doesn't affecting your life your kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work\nOr in a given a school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrant for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent\nLess so you know people don't want is\nRight I live out in western New York where it's a it's very blue collar area\nA ... year a year or so we've said\nIt'll truckloads of illegal or legal immigrants arrested or the seven eleven\nOn their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen a chain of Mexican restaurants in and uh and was in Buffalo or where they pulled out of a whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them in cash\nAnd he just got a found guilty the other day\nOn this kind of crackdown needs to continue because I'll tell ya in western New York and buffalo where we used to be a strong steel worker town\nWe're not in the war we're we're starting to come back to the leadership of president Donald Trump\nBut men and women here need these jobs need these jobs and and they they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about and the Democrats and the mainstream media spend their time trying to\nLight them on this issue talking about how important a ... an immigration and for the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're complaining is illegal immigration for president isn't against immigration\nHe's against illegal immigration and and I think the American people see through you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process or the first the immigration process\nAnd then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if you got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it\nYou know and the problem she sees as it sees around and bite people\nSome of them are now over ... him in central\nAnd since it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly you ... if you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and ... was one way shape or form a and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they it can't happen because because well without a border you're not a country Reagan said that\nHe was completely right a border exist to help you maintain their sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is what we need but look the chaos at the at the border is is not\nDissimilar a Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets and the ... and the aftermath of Kavanaugh\nA and the Democrats prefer that because if this chaos you need more government\nGovernment grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh\nScreaming in the hearings the the the people running down the uh the always a basement of the United states Capitol screaming at senators but the people trapping senators in an elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras\nThe mobs of people outside the capital and\nAfter he was confirmed the people trying to literally ... their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building\nIf they liked that they're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans wouldn't lose the house\nBecause a lot of people who were not measure well by the polls in twenty six team they call us deplorable is right that people who hadn't voted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like\nIllegal immigration thinking that their vote didn't matter at all they found a champion in Donald Trump someone they fought a non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in the mid term election\nThose kinds of folks tend to think well I got my guy and I'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kid off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or they don't you know uh skipper for their birthday party after work to go vote\nOn it and and the this time around they better do it because they think the part of the president's not on the ... he is\nOn ... and ... that's an excellent point and Michael what's happening in the twenty seventh congressional district in New York Congressman Chris Collins what's happening there\nWell Collins as some of your listeners might know or was charged with insider trading here I'm a recently after it was too late to get them off the ballot um you know he declares his innocence and you know we believe a presumption of innocence but near twenty seven

five forty Laura\n\nGreatest economy we've ever had\n\nEvery reason\nFor me to do this and it was\nI said this will happen this is a much easier situation [noise]\nEight\nFive five forty Laura we're going to bring your attention to critical races across the country one of them is Pennsylvania seventh congressional district where Marty knows Stein is running to replace the retiring never Trump or a Charlie Dent\nA thank God he's being replaced and Marty is in a tight race against Democrat lefty Susan Wild\nAnd this has been redistricted but I'm telling you something Marty is the person you all have to get out and vote for in Pennsylvania seven he joins us now and also is an avid cyclist within the two thousand\nUh Olympics as attract cyclists does a lot of ah incredible stuff for his community and it's going to support the president's agenda on the economy immigration trade all the rest of Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there and what issues to the people care about most as you're approaching this all important midterm fight\nLower first of all thanks for having me\nYou know covering every corner this district which is now a new district ... district has everything from the urban corps of Allentown ... nice to into the cause of farming communities in the northern tier work district what we call this late a region or what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy\nPeople are happy with this economy they're happy with what our president's been able to accomplish we're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know or the rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue they don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now\nA lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what is at stake if they flip the house on a cruise in Congress\n[noise] what what uh when when you see the redistricting that but obviously a it is is being done in many cases to add\nA urban voters to what is traditionally a blue collar or a more conservative district it makes the Republicans jobs in in in a way more difficult to are trying to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection\nBut on the issue of for instance immigration when we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border or even in ...\nLawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\nI think that's really on a lot of people's minds is just a radical a resistance we're seeing from the last\nA rash of people to the border again we we we we read this chapter book for we've seen it happen um most people I'm Talking to I Would say the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform\nOr we need to secure our southern border and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to was supportive that\nI'm so immigration up here in the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania seventh district although we're not a border state uh it is something that's it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty's Susan Wild is they they ... they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the woman or because of the me too movement the women's march and so forth are so ... would they try to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district [laughter] well\nThat's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran in her primary or somebody on the ... are left now she's trying to move\nTo the center but a her results speak for themselves or you know she she's she's for radicalism she's from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy in Iraq or see you\nKnow for teaching the president pitching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any commercial she won't stayed on any public forums but the end of the day that's what she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nMarty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth has been made possible by this president's focused uniquely on the American worker the American people [noise] it's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward\nI've been watching some of your campaign or commercials and events on line and the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness and calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black masks\nAnd smashing car windows and and uh and raising the flags of other countries in America they want an American to be a safe prosperous nation where security is paramount in our our virtue is freedom a is always you know upheld and raised high\nI think it's job not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that the results we've seen in the primaries they're very vocal um you're right they show up and mobs uh we we announced a campaign um our our\nBrand opening of hurricane campaign headquarters the night before they threw rocks to our windows uh you know so this is the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in country seven district which in my opinion I was born and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called at home I never saw it like this before in my life\nI'm a relatively young man I'm forty seven years old but what you're seeing right now the resistance from the other side is it is it's it's really quite alarming\nAnd hunted and funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America's standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth Marty no stay in my writing a diner I Can't wait to see you in Congress\n[noise]\nFollowing is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management my story began with that a lot of credit card debt\nCall if you're in debt and you need help cold trinity a one eight hundred seven nine for over four three seven when I first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I look at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical that\nThat was in my life would go way Kennedy will consolidate your accounts to do one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands what I Would tell other people please pick up the phone and call trinity just let them put together a ...\nOr the commonwealth of Virginia this was a conservative blue collar military a lot of veterans and now if it Barbara Comstock loses in Fairfax County Virginia and she's behind and is a congressional race reelection\nShe loses I saw something on TV say I guess it was Charlie hurt yesterday on the Fox special report panel it'll be the last time we ever have a Republican Congress person in this Fairfax County district which is right\nNear DC so this is now been transformed because of immigration illegal and otherwise and liberal policies follow always liberal policies always follow wear a mask crush of illegal immigration has moved into a community that's why the\nAh African Americans and Latinos in poll after poll will tell us that immigration has adversely affected their communities\nBecause it has I'll give you that a stat just a moment a doctor my Christian is with us or he is the director of the global face Institute former Muslim Sunni\nWho converted from Islam to Christianity and he's been following the media and their use the manipulation of this story from\nUnless uh who wrote for the Washington Post or is or was murdered\nAnd apparently it's all Donald Trump's falls Dr Christian good to have you with us out what how do we need to look at this story mid term voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they're now at this affects their daily lives but the media are using this story to do what\nFigure much for having me every day for the ship the porch and in the ... and you were right when you have a party that is run by by then and uh uh you know those old ah guards it's it looks like they are profiting from inside when I I I think actually this um\nYou know story about a ... a reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on\nThe election if we're not going to get the truth out and and the reason of that is is when you know many people actually don't understand you know that's a change in between the United states and Saudi Arabia\nAnd try to point out that the Trump is a you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and the ... and and also to dictators and so forth which is far from too if you listen to Trump in his last quarter August before this incident broke out\nEmbarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times and that was a huge big a media thing going on in\nThe whole Middle East so uh when we look at this incident I think people need to understand that Trump is not\nI'm backing up the Saudis because he loves the dumps the dictates of his all for personal gain because this is nonsense is doing this because the Saudi Government the government the government is doing a good work that helps to the states and he's in America first\nUn American interest a president which is different from bite and then Obama and all of those\nPrevious president without states and why I'm saying that because you and you look at what the current um gum prince and the south the government is doing they have many friends they're number one is they are hurting by defending the Islamic movement\nBy looking or in house arrest more than five hundred moms in Saudi Arabia and all\nThey are fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in the country and even in other countries they had been denied states um\nWhen they are fighting Iran and its aggression in the middle east there hunting big time they get on a the Iranian sanctions are and how Trump is putting those on\nBy living the oil prices and on all the stuff also the current administration will kind of leadership in um a Saudi Arabia is hurting usher in a peace treaty\nThat never ever be imagined before and they're not Trump is about to announce that are very very soon what is going to be involved in Saudi Arabia and and but it's in Egypt and Israel which is going to be eliminating the danger of this conflict has been going on for seven years so Donald Trump is supporting\nUm you know the government a leadership in Saudi Arabia because of those reasons and those seasons and on and all of those\nHead for the United states not that dictate the ship and ... plus adding to all of this we believe in this country that everybody is innocent until until proven otherwise so when we are dealing with this issue as well as we have to follow the due process to go to the investigation and find out what's going on and you know\nI I tend to believe that I Am American inside out since I'm a great in the United states but still ... over there and my ... in my home brew which\nYou know nothing happens by coincidence when uh the president of turkey is very much over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time off to the Trump Administration embarrassed him publicly and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the the faster and the release of ...\nAll of this incident going taking place\nExcellent point [noise] well I think again mark ... America\nAnd ... and the American voters\nIf they're given the proper information and not the talking points to the left the ... which again it's it's the it's so sad and it's so predictable they always go to racism they always go to a phobia they this is all they have it's it's\nWomen are oppressed and the United states or every minority group is a pressing the United states the president loves autocrats the president\n... I mean it's so predictable that it's almost boring to talk about\nBut meanwhile the Democrats are giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people\nWho are about to cross into America unless we do something about this thousands and thousands of people\nMany of them this is an adult men or young military age men who are have joined this caravan in or being supported by someone or some organization\nTo storm into this country to try to change this country electorally\nThat is the goal here the goal is to replace the American voters who elected Donald Trump with a new class of voters who have no background or understanding of the American story that's what's happening and it's outrageous and Americans have to stand against its total lawlessness\nA dynamite and what are your what are your thoughts on the immigration issue I think the Democrats have made a big mistake thinking this is going to help them in the midterms\nWhen the Democrats and the left and the media that supports the left is a crazy and they have gotten ideas is why the old was go to this year's men\nAnd all the kinds of ideas that they talk about that means absolutely nothing but when I pay attention to the media and what's going on number one is in the last two days they start talking about how the Hispanic votes are not going for the Democrats are going for Donald Trump\nAnd an historic on weight and then right after that they start talking about the current events\nMarching to the border of the United states and what they are trying to do is to try to divide and to try to uh make the Hispanic\nVotes jump into the vote a boost and try to both would have been so this is a very well organized by the media and I\nHave no idea how they do it but I have no doubt that everything is it than I Do pay attention to the states they talk about it for three days how the Hispanic voting for Trump in a historical way and then all of a sudden\nWe have an ... you know problem on the on the border and then we have to figure this out and Donald Trump's days we're not going to let that happen\nAnd I think Hispanic votes order in Americans can see through this because\nI trust that when you come to this nation and you believe in that and we understand that they'll continue that you have you're not going to be received by the uh the Betty filthy a war of the left and what they are trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nMark Christian um eras such a treasure we really appreciate your voice speaking up for truth and freedom and religious liberty and a common sense pragmatic foreign policy\nWhere we have to make alliances with people in or been in countries that now when we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American people sometimes we have to do that\nAnd don't keep your eye on the ball people because what mark said is exactly right this is calculated and and it's actually so transparent it's pathetic\nA doctor my Christian here on the lower income show will take a break get your calls do you agree that this is a calculated strategy get Donald Trump out there on this immigration issue and think that because he talks about it Hispanic voters will start turning out\nLaura the Laura Ingraham show [noise]\n\n\n... attention you could be paying too much for your health insurance new two thousand Eighteen health insurance laws have lowered costs dramatically you may be significantly overpaying open enrollment is now and it's the best time to maximize your savings you may be able to save as much as forty percent\nLike John ... fifty two year old in Florida was being two Ninety a month now only a hundred and Seventy four months or a thirty two year old woman was paying one fifty now banned only Seventy nine dollars a month new low cost health insurance plans are now available as a zero Kobe's or zero deductibles\nTop quality health insurance at the lowest prices anywhere call now and ask about dental plans under a hundred dollars a year for the entire family\nA visit our website at our\nMortgage dot com that's a LA home mortgage dot com to see just how much money you can be saving with an Alabama home mortgage and in the last three Seventy three something for equal housing ...\n[noise]\nChevrolet Master control center says is W.

I guess much how many times I've screwed up and you know I went broke I lost everything had to start over and all that and that's where all this came from this passion for helping other people came from\nOh my goodness I've been where'd you get a settlement that large from\nA I got in a pretty bad motorcycle accident Mm\nHow're you doing\nAh I Am I'm blessed to be here on actually having okay you're physically coming back by yes ah my body recover degree so I'm happy I can do just a little bit or I'm a movement issues in my shoulder but ...\n... you got any future surgeries coming up a no okay well good luck I'm Glad you're I'm Glad you're doing so good that's awesome okay same so uh what what are you are thinking of putting the money on\n[noise] so me and my wife have agreed that we want to use this money to buy a house but she um [noise]\nWhen we were not agreeing on me that she wants to put it the majority of the money all the down payment and save about twenty thousand for emergencies ... and I ain't the perfect time to get rid of all like that\nAnd we'll still have a good amount or a down payment on a house and still have some leftover but she agrees with me with that mhm and I just wanted to hear your opinion on what you think would be the better move\nOr she's not agreeing with you I don't know why she would agree with me [laughter] but anyway the uh uh we tell people not to buy a home unless your debt free how much debt do you have\nTo get a we have about forty five thousand dollars\nI Would pay that off and I would hold twenty back for an emergency and put to rest as your down payment if I were in your shoes I Would not buy a house with still laying around I think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble and so on and so my vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't\nHonestly I don't know why she wouldn't listen to make now let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never borrow money again\nOkay yes I have a chance to talk to her about that I'm actually a new economic trying to get here on board mhm she's not really to come ... about also having trouble\nGetting her on board with the plan is when\nYou know I can imagine so um\nUntil you can come into agreement\nOkay because you're going to make a mistake when you Shannon I when we have an argument like this we uh we have to we have a rule we have to do nothing\nUntil we can come in agreement on large purchases large gifts large decisions we decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement\nAnd uh so I I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial piece university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to a her mother trying to help me out just because she started bringing about ... and her mother is on my side as well a\nI ask what I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial base university to the nine lessons and if I gave you the one year membership Yes sir you think so why she's ...\nI think that I mean my me and her mother would sit down with her and explain to her um\nGo to the clients is free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you\nOK because if you go by yourself it'll cause of divorce is you're going to get more and more and more and more excited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and you get it's going to drive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two glasses with you I think she'll go on and go to the others I'm pretty persuasive but ah but\nDon't go by yourself do it'll cause problems hold on I'll have Kelly pickup I'll give you the financial position roasting membership for a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else\nUm but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is All right Dave is with us in Stockton, California Hi Dave how are you\nOh good afternoon Dave how you doing Jay\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nWith that that's good to say I'm\nWith my wife and I are in a few coordinators and were dead tree debt free [noise]\nAnd we need your wisdom and guided something where we also have a little disagreement um last you see that her son got married we loaded with money to help them out really I'd knowing knowing that we would never probably see the money again okay [noise] um\nWhy would you do that here in ...\nI you know what that's a good question that's a good question I maybe it's because I haven't ... for about a year and I lost touch with ... with that aspect of it but um we volunteered to pay for the material that they take a class which they did\nBut in the end they did and disagreements alcohol in principles\nAnd Henri building a ... kind of al ... well after six months we decided that they weren't trying to make the U.S back\nAnything we kind of let them you know we weren't alone and be more money because they had made no effort to to reimburse anything of it and and there was no communication to indicate me ordered payments back\nWell you know life goes several months later they're only vehicle broke down and um and they could not be repaired and my son had no way to get to work and this is where it gets sticky 'em knowing that my wife has a good picture of her parents trustworthy ... to all the fisheries including him\nWe both agreed to front about Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding that he would immediately case back when the checks or in some of the logic was it they were our income is under the art and keep it in ... her parents stress\nAnd today we have not ...\nThere is going to be just to the next couple of weeks when you when do you do in the meantime they they took out I'm a five or a eight thousand dollar loans to pay off for them and said well we'll do in the otherwise they'd be evicted in our daughter live there's not one of the work to help out [laughter]\nSo my angle is similar mirrors and because they have not given a tribute responsibility to pay back their loan\nI have strongly suggested ... and I I think that's about as far as I can go to this is my wife died that my wife write the check to them having come over and over just\nAnd we would write them a check for the balance of what they didn't borrow ... ... we didn't we didn't find them and it seems simple and we know for if we approach it that way that would be successful\nAnd with a lemonade the temptation that using the current under everybody not ... the greed and be in my opinion be more proactive to solving this\nShow as much from a non thousand dollars\nRight ... right now what's your network out with that what's your net worth\nUm [noise] I don't know five hundred six hundred\nWhat your household income [noise] ah\n... I'm thirty maybe okay right and\nThey'll let me just say oh you know here's my opinion this is all your fault my fault yeah OK you loan money that we're broke and don't handle money well and went against everything that you were supposed to have been taught by us which was you loan family money\nRight here the one might mess\nI okay I take your job or the now and trying to correct it they're not making it worse yeah and so I'm\nWondering you could do you say forget it I don't pay me back forget it I'm an idiot I shouldn't be given your money I've never given you any more ever under any circumstances\nRight right it she she believes that that we should just be trusting meal the check to them and then hope they'll reimburse us\nEither you're ...\nOr ... that my ... hunter ... they're not going to not soft and legally ridiculous assumption\nAnd you mail a check to them you're never going to see this money and they're on their side if you're going to speak to your own children over\nIt's just the crap you get into when you're alone family members money all your fault\nTo if she wants to walk you through that that's fine\nApso will be ludicrous\nYou calls every day\nTell you a story about two families litter of very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't big difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education and retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to Sandra insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and\nCongratulations you guys very proud of yeah awesome you don't have\nMuch\nI Love your strange alive at a\nNormal broke normal sucks went on a normal guy in a weird that's the best complement you can get on the day Ramsey show I'll just tell you got a copy and Chris ... book for you to retire inspired that's the next chapter in your story for you to be not only that free but now\nTo be millionaires and outrageously generous as you go along and you make good money you don't have a payment on the world you should be there ... they soon\nWell done guys look look and see Grand Forks North Dakota a hundred and twenty thousand dollars paid off in thirty six months when I get eighty five to one ten Bybee touchdown counted down let's zero debt free scream\nThree to ... yeah\nWell done very well\n[noise] fell\nOver the past month our fall live events season has been going nonstop man we're going crazy record crowds sellouts on every event and when you leave one of these events is kind of like a pep rally forget your act together you know\nIt's a pep rally for your family so you when you when I say touchdown man I mean you scored they usually you're the hero of the game and you did it\nAnd it's pretty humbling we had six thousand folks the smart conference last weekend and in Kansas City I remember it will in San Francisco the week before we were doing that of course I'll get another one of the smart money events that are for about three thousand broke sellouts everywhere so as we do every October\nAre you reading it's time to announce the spring smart\nThe drum roll please February the ... of course all gonna Anthony O'Neill but doing smart money in Raleigh North Carolina\nFebruary twentieth Anthony O'Neill and I will be in Grand Rapids Michigan and February the twenty first of the next day Chris Hogan and Anthony O'Neill will be in Cincinnati, Ohio bone ...

credit card game\nI have two cars were the same balance card one charges twenty seven point nine percent interest card to charge nine point nine which one do I attack and pay off first or if they're the same balances you pay off the interest rate first\nBut I think there's a bigger problem Linda\nThe Bible says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks what's going on inside of you causes you to choose the words that\nYou use you need to stop talking about you're talking\nI allowed myself to fall into the credit card game no you didn't\nHe walked straight up signed up for the card there was no falling you're not a victim you walk straight up and signed up for stupid\nAnd you did it on purpose own it\nI've done a lot dumber than you've done ghetto but I'll walk straight up and signed up for stupid and as long as I blame the government blamed amino banker I blame the IRS or I blame the economy I was not getting any better and I did I sat around and wind like it was a former like I was a form of prayer\nBut you got our own it you didn't fall\nAnd the credit card that you've ever heard anybody say I was forced to buy a car or a bull crap you are not no one's ever forced you to do anything they didn't have a gun at the car dealerships by car I'm going to shoot you\nThere was no collusion there was no extortion you were forced to buy a car you want a freaking car and you rationalize the crowd out of it stop lying to yourself it's one of the steps you have to take to get your life straightened out\nSo you didn't allow yourself to fall you walk straight up and signed up for stupid\nSay it like it is it'll help you in the healing process I Know because I had to go through the same thing to do [noise] I mean there's ... there's a New Jersey may know how are you Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\n'em 'cause Oh thanks for taking my call 'em my question is I'm I'm a two part actually the first one um I I make about forty to forty five\nAnd I worked for both of if they have a a a student loan debt of like um about Fifteen thousand dollars [laughter]\nAnd I'm I'm two friends one of them is I'm\nAsking me to go for a business\nOr like a friend um subway business so I was thinking about taking a loan for that and my other friend is I'm all for me like to go buy a house with him to the share like a two family house so I take one apartment he takes the other\nAnd it's going to be with a mortgage growing too so I wanted to know what should I Do [laughter]\nMm okay well we tell folks to borrow money around here if you listen to the show very much\nThe shortest path to wells and peace and your finances is to avoid that and on top of that I Would tell you to avoid partnerships as the only ship that won't sale so\nWhat that means is is that if you still want to remain friends with both these guys I Would suggest you say no because at the end of these stories there was a nightmare\nGoing in partners with somebody in debt to go into the restaurant business would you do know squat about is a good way to end up bankrupt and lose your friendship forever the only in partners or somebody to buy a house and then he doesn't pay his half or can't pay his eye out for you don't pay your ever came by your half is ah\nWhen I was a precursor to the ending of our friendship and a foreclosure\nSo no I wouldn't do either one of those and that's my reasoning\nI think you'll have a lot better life have you avoid both of those paths and you can you can develop a career path that does not involve you're going into debt to start a business it's a matter of fact most businesses start without bet\nThey just start small\nWe started this one without the card table my living room we didn't have a big fancy studio we went down to the local radio station drove over there and they let us use their stuff because we worked for free there\nNow is figure out a way to get going and you what we call bootstrap it and it works but you don't have to go get an SBA loan and go deeply in debt to buy a subway franchise in order to be in business that some mythology\nThomas's weathers in Philadelphia Hi Thomas how're you Dave thank you very much for taking my call sure what's up\nI'm I just graduated with a degree an actual real science back in may wow and I'm working at McDonald's making nine dollars an hour why I I've been applying I'm applying and I just I Can't find a job and I don't know what to do\nMm [noise]\nWell I I Would assume that the primary job for that would be an insurance companies correct\nYeah I I've [noise] through the end of my last year of school I\nGot very turned off the actual real science so I've been applying to finance jobs and I can't get anything 'cause everyone should everyone wants you to have experience and I don't have the experience and I I graduated early so I did I did summer classes and it can get internships\nOsama classes mhm what kind what kind of went into a job or you tried into\nFinancial analyst financial\nI'm like I've I've been even doing accounting\nLike account may have little any mhm receivables\nEntry level stuff or you get your foot in the door I'm OK well here's here's one thing I Will tell you and Ken Coleman will tell you this is will go to the Ken Coleman show dot com and download his free PDF on how to put together a resume but resumes in\nUm I'll give you an example uh we have eight hundred people here just under a hundred people work on our team we hired a hundred and fifty to two hundred last year we had Fifteen thousand applications for those honored hires\nYou get lost and that ... and ... there's not that I don't wanna answer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people is just logistically not reasonable\nAnd so what ends up happening is you get lost and the stack of that stuff unless you know someone that works there and you don't have to be best friends with them you just because I got to tell you we don't ever hire somebody because somebody called me and says are ever but we would give them an interview\nAnd pull their pull their resume out of the stack\nYou got to get out of the pile you know and so some of these places are trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that's married a\nKids play soccer where the guy that works over there or something like that where you can find someone that'll put in a little bit of a word for you to at least get the door open\nAnd that'll get you in the door again you're you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact there are very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your hired an almost never happens that'll decent job anyway [noise]\nI mean if they're hiring bodies you can get all or something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview you and learn about trees and that will be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a fire but we will at least talk to them and you know what might be a very short conversation though you don't qualify and fed snow or\nAt least we'll talk to them and gets a resume out of the pile if somebody knows I'm Sorry go download\nAnd listen to the homeless show he'll help you with all this stuff is very very difficult out there but I think you can leave some\n\n\nWhy in the world would you trust some random guy in a Q when getting your mortgage you really think he cares about your longer money goes boy doesn't\nThose companies care about getting you and do whatever home loan program they're pushing that week when it comes to ordering a cheeseburger the meal deal works fine but let's get real people were talking about the largest investment you'll probably ever make so don't be naive and trust an order taker\nWho pressures you into a pre packaged alone\nMy friends are Churchill mortgage I'm helping my listeners for over twenty five years\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years out because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I thought\nYeah 'cause now I mean you make three hundred four hundred five hundred worry make it it's you're going to be unbelievably weapons so you said your how thirty thirty one thirty want oh\nWe'll just fabulous and congratulations thank you I'm so proud of you who was your biggest cheerleader I Know you had to have good tractors that was easy yeah but who is the biggest cheerleader\nOr I Would say my parents ah my mom had followed you for years and also people in my church family as well because they I talk a lot of actually them are encouraging me to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans yeah\nSo I mean you went from being completely crushed by student loan debt to completely own and it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't really have\nAnother planet so I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later I Am a final payment\nYeah you probably know almost two hundred thousand a year for two years ... ... you were on which is pretty incredible what are you making for Fifteen modest taxes which takes a big chunk of it so you weren't living you weren't you weren't splurging on anything now\nAre you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging and just completely under so as you're going lawyer you're hitting this thing when you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah a Fifteen to twenty a month to only given month\nAt what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this is actually going to work how far in war you before the before kind of the switch kind of flip for you\nWell I paid off all the smallest loans or sign a total of twenty different student loans and so I was able to attack the smallest ones first and then once I saw how easy it was to do that\nAnd then I started to have some more hope that I Would be a what a pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I just looked at it and it was like there was no way like there's I'm not going to be able to do this\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking them off the little baby ones when you first started yeah and that yeah that had to give you a lot of emotional boost death and is that snowball really kicked in for you then they did what he was supposed to do that let you know that this is going to work mhm wow\nWow wow wow wow wow All right so what is the big takeaway when someone says oh I'm I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't get out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this I think like most things\nAnd stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never got a debt and I once I used to it and once I took personal responsibility for it\nAnd realized that I'm the one who signed the papers balloons and now I Need to get myself out uh then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money\nAnd they are their income as much less sugar than what mine is but I learned most\nPeople's [laughter] [noise] yeah\nYeah I definitely learned how to live on a budget for my parents and also um they had been in quite a bit of a credit card debt in the past and I always told me you know don't be stupid with credit card to um make sparked or purchases and so I think I learned a lot of those principles from them\nYou know there was a there was a sense that character that came from them that they cause you're able to do this is what I was thinking\nYeah very good very good well I'm proud of you know they are well done very well done what a great great story well we've got a copy of Chris

they pay any attention to those in between twilight states of consciousness too between sleep in the wake\nThat's a good time to catch it means good time to back them loose and dreaming but many people don't realize that that just ... because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that\nSometimes we close our boundary because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and said no more

but not young enough but not rich enough whenever find the right to do the right guy and sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream because we don't think we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see an are waking life these of some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you follow the the simple suggested instead I offer you couldn't get Cho dreams that you can stop dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with it might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nWere then you can dream wide awake world around you will speak the language of signs and symbols and things but as you could pay attention and sometimes you get more alert to the pop ups those pop up waking life that can give you ship is because you feel my gosh that was a hidden hand to work\nThat that helps to turn on the dream club in the night as well\nAs some incredible ways to dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you had had some stories are directly related to that\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again and there's a hilarious story a mysterious realities about a woman doctor for England is complaining of the breakfast table oh Robert why do I keep having the same as the dream when I got to do my medical exams Thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say\nIt's the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because you have dreamed producers who are making a tree movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through to you and trying to get you to understand the situation I'm trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on there trying to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I I did one of the stories I I pick to sort of dream production movie company\nThat is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked how I'll dream produces might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they have to keep on making the same offices\nAnd not getting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that ... come about I mean dreams of not older people did one box we do have dreamed productions where you feel\nAnd you might be quite right when you feel this that there was a production crew behind the scenes that is making a certain kind of dream to you because you need to get a message and another the stories of mysterious reality as I describe a very strange women who sat down next to me in a plane an old reality and mentioned me at a certain point the dead house under the period huh\nHe was a pop musician he'd been shot in the face and a diner in Seattle\nLa the knees a creepy story and he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies for people that they're seeing their dreams that I'm doing the music and the special effects I think back to that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dreams\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might be you the dream a if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you become conscious it might be that some shadow or hidden aspect of yourself maybe if you're a high a self made people cite the wiser and fight the highest though\nIs the director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you\nIs not alien to is not hostile to you and is probably being run by someone with a slightly ... perspective and maybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways the dream shock is awake into doing some course correction is\nVery dramatize and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are parcel Robert in ah I've always used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nRight I mean I think that here's here's where our our current understanding of dreaming and currents physics uh meet up I mean they are counting on the stand by kinda understanding I mean there really is ready to revive some guidance and understanding about dreams of dreaming is traveling for example\nA physics tells the science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information condom field of information that contain everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it\nAccording to our ability to harvest information and do something with it and ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discover the Post's no doorway into this whole on some information field\nAnd depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information might getting we can bring through more and more I mean you could set an intention any night for example to be very simple about this as simple as a practical you can do dream in basements being to set an intention\nTo get guidance on anything that interest you and probably something will come through if you don't think you've got anything they wake\nGet ready to lose a dream on that subject as well because you've got some rest nearby to take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they've come true across history one of my book the secret history of dreaming\nIs full of stone narratives affirm the documentation that suggest that dreaming is actually a secret engine in the history of everything in the history of credit breakthroughs in science and technology in the aughts even in business and economics says no\nSo when you say that if you wake up to what dreaming is it can take you anywhere you are literally correct it really can can take us to the hidden dimensions of reality that super string theory pounds it\nIt can take us into the off the lights the UCs those hands off the job opportunities some living environment a like a bee on death so you can talk to an ancestor beloved loved ones and ...\nAnd others so you know this is the ... the other venture killing guidance and possibility that opens when you become a more conscious ...\nWhat about the ability to chime travel in your dreams\nWhere we do it we do it whether we know do not do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival function of dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on a practical mystic George I think you knew that I won't take away this put in power out everyday life and one of the things I Know from my own life and those I work with is the dream show you the future in a way that is actionable I mean this is very important dream shows\nOpportunities and challenges lie ahead they ... the things we don't yet know about\nThey can save your life they can save the job they can say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today\nIf I did not know for certain shows that I had that I have avoided death on the road predates was dancing fatal accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecast book was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision will be Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to file on her on the other side of a blind spot for example so that's one direction for time travel but time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact\nTo understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of the NEA time altogether we step into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times when you're leading a power life this becomes very interesting when you begin to look at give some lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present mice and how to avoid things went wrong and not another parallel life\nI think it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you last time I'll be guide to that younger self or

getting nervous because I Dreamed sometime ago I have a live contract that says I have to publish a book out on a short of that\nThat's still pretty prolific though good for you good for you and they're ... they're all fascinating works but\nIt is nice dreams are so important I mean I I think people can you make themselves healthy in a dream that you can get a better job in a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them and dreams it's amazing what you can do with dreams isn't it\nAnd you live to some really interesting areas for example in terms of how\nI mean one of the things going on in dream but their body chalk as well as folk joke in other words and dreams we see what's going on inside the body and old fashioned doctors understand the traditional Chinese medicine for example this is from ... to the idea is that a dream\nAt the body might show symptoms that are developing my enabled us to avoid those symptoms but that's one of the functions of framing and the and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health\nI'll dreams which shows the things that help us to get them to stay well and and it's world acting upon those dreams of trying to bring their energy through you mentioned connecting with other people were United telepathy which literally means fellow feeling at a distance or or being in touch with someone else\nIt's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people who are related to each other either by Lovell by family or\nBy common colds or whatever I'm not aware more often that they might be dreaming with ...\nAnd all of each other I mean there is a phenomenal shed dreaming or interactive creamy which we find themselves sharing adventures with friends and other people I mean this was another fascinating phenomena and dream as a matter of fact you discover if you wake up to your dreams remember more look at what's going on\nBut you have what used to be cold and it's been cold again super normal capacity abnormal then don't supernatural but they're beyond the normal and we're talking about things like ... nation until after the ... and and so on and and\nAnd and you are able to see things before they happen to me was he things at a distance but I go to connect with other people and these are natural powers and abilities that along to you and if you become a more active you know you'll find the fewer growing and developing these kids so that they're very helpful in life\nIn terms of creative solutions for things green tool to live with them if you can't find a solution to problem the old ...\nPut the question to your dreams and see what ... and I would add to that that you can do this in everyday life as well because dreaming for me it's not just about what happens when you close your eyes it's what happens when you open your eyes wider so part of this part of part of the fence with all this is\nThe world around you once again we'll speak to like a dream if you pay attention so\nI encourage people many of my story is done on this\nTo notice what goes on in the the main thing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a photo preoccupation on your mind and suddenly the will deliver said incidents are striking\nThat gives you not only a reflection on what's on your mind but sometimes\nA way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is\nPut your questions of the world go down the street or go into the pocket go and your morning commute\nBut that question in your mind and receive the first unusual unexpected thing that enters your field of perception as a message from the use of the surrounds you it is amazing how specifically the world will speak to you and delivering a dream my message when you play that game\nAnd Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape and the and I had it on tape\nAnd I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person on the street reporter\nAnd or what I Would do when I dropped it off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I concentrated on that person every night when I went to bed or he already had my tape I hadn't heard from\nA mature enough after two days of going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nI'm visualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and uh here in us two days later the guy calls me and says hey I liked his tape and I've got something for your come on down it work study\nYes wow you're than the euro ... and you're manifested George I'm not surprised one bit you know Mark Twain staged experiments of this guy he called them mental ... feedback in his day when people said telegrams\nHe'd make a habit of writing a letter or an old fashioned telegram to someone he wanted to be in contact with I'm not mailing it he just ... attention\nSo they almost didn't celebrate that was the response so you're practicing your game that is a joke and it works I mean we know the thought are already thing they're already thoughts and feelings already action and if you're thinking about another person you're probably going to reach them\nUnless they shielded again being reached a menu of reaching into but nine way to do something good we wouldn't want to be open to be reached by just anybody with with the intention but that's a lovely creative and benign example of sending a mental sending medical political the is what Mark Twain\nAnd I you know I subsequently used it a lot by doing the same techniques and it's almost as if they have this inbox that you get on the same path with and you drop your little messages in there and then for some reason they pick it up yeah\nWe'll we'll do a little experiments in my groups by which one of those degrees the bell send an image should not get painting it might be a sculptor it's announced image to the group and people have the gas in the morning after the night of sending walk the walk the image that was being sent\nMy to beat and it's interesting how that works and some people a very good at picking it up and some people a better send those so now the ... this is just a focused example of something that we do automatic they were connected with each other where to burn into weaving field of interaction and it goes on and on of dreams overtime\nRobert you've talked about synchronous city explain how that ties into our dreams\nWell I think it's like this way to make a dreaming once we understand the dreamy might be traveling we get out there we go beyond the cook will develop or re I'm standing in a consensual elusive nations suddenly get into a deep space we have encounters with people who live in a deeper space including the hotter than our ancestors\nTruth synchronous today we often heal the forces and intelligence to live on the other side of those cook in the walls of Audrey understanding\nCome pushing up poking oh tickling to bring us a way to give us a message of some kind\nOf this is the thing about ... the young guys would sit in front and see 'cause it's set up

ancestors are in play\nSo I Am a great proponent and then actually conditions and shapes every day of my life but paying attention to the unusual unexpected things that are going on in the world around you and seeing what the ... looks like\nNot just one message you might get one message you needed at say stop or something like that\nBut you might notice that there's a pat enough connection is you've got it through the day is certain team comes up again and again a certain cymbal comes up again and again and you notice when that is happening with a recurring dream hey slowdown pay attention or what you need to do with this what is the use of those telling you that you need to act upon\nRobert since you've been doing this had to we got any answer on why it works or how it works

crane dot com [noise]\nI'm saying well let's get lots that Robert ... take on some of those rubber what do you think is happening to him well it's\nPossible that you were dreaming of future developments in technology and in other ways that might manifest you sound as if you haven't run into these situations in ordinary on the yet and hopefully you weren't\nAbout it's perfectly possible that you had long range pre cognition and dreams of situations that might develop in life it's also possible\nBut the dreams have a symbolic made not some Luttrell making but the symbolic me if I'm dreaming of of of the situation that seems very serious and talk and threatening going across the Cohen ... seeing this may be this EMT\nOkay maybe that's symbolic is something that lies ahead to me in life which is going to have the emotional flows into the vegetables or something like that maybe my dreams are actually coaching me preparing me for an emotional situation which are not all that full situation which I Need to be ready for dinner but that comes to my mind\nThe upside down cell phone you know I just want to holding that image I realize that might be something larger than most scary than a cell phone but I sort of want to reach into the dream and grab that cell phone let it be a cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end I mean\nThis is the way that I Am about treats I'm so probably what I mean I'd rather liked the idea of the upside down cellphone yeah it's scary but if it's my dream my actually however many years since the dream and sort of want to reach into the dream grab that cell phone\nOr hold it to my ear and say who is that talked to me while you and see what I get it might be that it's the kind of phony what you can talk to someone on the other side of death\nIn our dreams where often people are often talking to the dead on phones all receiving phone calls from ... want to go that direction without dream\nRobert wire dream sometimes convoluted and mired in a confusion in the parables and things like that why isn't it just so obvious\nI think that actually took the dream ... the dream so says many sources of ... to try to communicate as clearly as possible but but not necessarily is not enough to follow all of this\nAh and also we need to remember the dreams are experiences that whatever report we we quote to each other from a dream is only a report it's not the full experience so it might seem convoluted little confusing or not ... but that might be because we've only brought back a few things from the dream and don't know how to put them together which is why\nI find the best way to understand the dream is to try to get your head back inside to try to get back inside the ... take a look at what is really going on when you do that you pretty quick to determine whether it's literally symbolic you can fill in some of the get when you learn the technique of cream reentry of going back inside a dream\nI I and once we understand that I think one of the songs you were playing those something about living a whole life yeah imply implicitly and your dreams I mean once they understand that we're\nHaving tremendous experiences and couldn't live days or weeks in a in a dream in a few minutes to talk time we can begin to grasp that whatever we bring back the dreams of only partial and may be confused we might need to go beyond doubt\nAnd what's going on one is more prevalent to loosen dream free cognitive dreams just normal regular dreams what pops up the most\nWell a lot of people are dying seem yet to understand how to cut them loose a dream is the idea of lists of dreaming has become very popular since ... movie inception and and the idea is talented you couldn't make love to anyone in your dreams and you can be Superman that sets us so there's been a sort of adolescent quality to some of the\n... the fat the loose of dreaming but listen dreaming is actually easier than most people make it for themselves but many trying to memorize ways of waking up thanks to grieving inside of dream because your hands if you can stick a finger three of 'em are kind of stuff as I said earlier the easiest way to become looser treatments to start a looser stay that way\nSo I didn't know how common listed dreaming is amongst the population of the moment\nAt the moment I Do know that probably everybody is having ... previous but only a few people are aware of that yet only a few people look it up to it I think it's it's routine I think that we do in the night where do we know it or

noticing some dream that seemed to have a scene with moving parts square that is moving parts and I would kind of compare this to say like the second half of the Titanic movie where\nA DiCaprio is trying to find his way out of the ship as oil is moving parts and they still has that theme aren't they still wants to stay with us girlfriend and the movie or you know he still has hopes about the relationship so the idea of a dream showing moving parts\nMy second thing just as you're talking now [laughter] I was thinking of\nA I had played a lot of basketball and I never focused on jumping and I noticed\nA couple of times I block shots that word near the top of the back board so I had to be jumping high\nAny good jumping zero [laughter]\nThis was correlated to going to the gym a lot more and I wasn't going to the gym so I could jump higher you know is basically\nThis is [laughter] so I keep having to scream about shopping and I never really thought about shopping when I played a lot of basketball so what's the idea of a dream bringing up the aspects of something that a lot\nYet they focus on while you were doing it and why would a dream to that it's OK maybe like a singer you know always son to a certain type of song or in rock\nAnd springing up but not the type of a second you know\nHer interesting ... I mean I'm thinking if I if I Am a boomer player I end up doing at this stage in my life but here I Am jumping at higher so I used to do in in my dream\nMaybe the dream is preparing me for jump jump in life of a different kind where is the next tide jump I might want to take in my life it might be a new form of activity might be a new form of understanding where am I going to be a slam dunk in another field of activity in life so that we might be making an analogy\nBetween my ... my great prowess on on basketball coat\nWith these jumps at the gym but it lies ahead but the the moving parts and the Titanic and now that she was interesting is not a lot to go on but it by it moving pounce make me think of that you know emotional scene from the movie\nI might wonder again where in my life my being hit by this dream to move on in some sense and I can't think about the Titanic without recalling the there was a great British research a psychic phenomena in the paranormal WTC stead here the famous to them listed his day we went down on the Titanic\nTwenty years before he went down on the Titanic\nHe wrote a story about the record the supposedly unsinkable lineup cold the majestic you know even with the captain of the boat in his story was the name of the captain on the Titanic\nSo they're from the history of the Titanic we have an account of long range pre cognition as embodied the story Rob and simply a dream report I must add that stood up to death dictate that was said to dictated or a marketable account of life on the other side of death called the blue island so the Titanic association\nSaid also to pop moving in my mind that thank you for that\nAnd how do you explain things like Leonardo da Vinci came up with I mean he was a genius ... almost like a time traveler I wouldn't do that in a dream state you think\nYou you feel that in relation to sit and kind of mind into his office and said that you can't explain Tesla the original Tesla except as the time travel and you do feel that great minds are able to draw upon intelligence and understanding from more than ... reality they already do sense\nAble to reach two other mines the poet you ate the Irish poet we ate sue the theme of another my stories and mysterious realities\nHe spoke about the mingling of mine said what he was saying is if you're back on a certain closest study or inquiry or creative breakthrough you will attract the intelligence the intelligence and the the the the the support\nOf our minds reaching too from across time and I mentioned who is joining with you and making you more and giving you ... your older narrowly capable of\nI think all of this field is from time to time whether or not those words would we signed up to ... to us we notice in the moment of high creativity the most are members of voting in one sense or another that we are more than we are ordinarily something you know some creative spirit some intelligence piano old and remind is at work with us\nAt WWW dot capital city Ruben dot com capital city roofing recapitalize Ruben industry well\n[noise]\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center this is W.

were coming through had created a portal in my building and in my apartment\nAnd people who were had just died or coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty that was Battery Park\nSo that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people see they just kept coming caught me I guess you know\nAre you still love that area Joyce\nWe saw that apartment when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida but uh just like so many incredible things have people\nI think most people say well I was just something that just happened but write them down recording your dreams as I'm sure your your next guest has got to tell us\nBut write everything down trying to analyze what you're experiencing I'm the best way to develop your yes pay is to try to remember and to try to record which are experiencing and will really happen that way and open up more on the fact that consciousness you'll be able to help other people as well\nSo that's that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences I had a I don't know if I should if\nYou're ready for me to tell you another one of a one my phenomenal experiences about a\nLot of low yeah sure absolutely OK George thank you [laughter] I had never heard of\n... but uh I had an out and about maybe four years ago I had this out and party experience where I did astro travel which I had really no memory of doing ever before\nI think we all travel and we just forget it but we don't know about it but this was unusual because I went to um a Tibetan well I'm a story and to say this\nLama whose name was ... and you know in Tibet George on the day the baby is born that's the first name he was born on a Tuesday so same Tuesday lob sayings name is rampant and if you go to his website it's a lump saying ramp a dot org\nBut he came to me and I went on this phenomenal trip\nTo Islam history and he had a the ability to answer many of my question is that this\nMan had many walking experiences supposedly he was over many hundreds of years of age he had taken different bodies on the last one more out he took a new body on and he was living as an Englishman\nAnd it's finally carnation on the earth Nineteen eighties so\nI was at Islam is Terry and it was phenomenal and I came back to my body brought me back and I was on was waking up he said to me don't forget my name and I had never heard I couldn't remember it but my husband was there and I said check before I wake up please write this down and\nI spelled it out ... and I misspelled it slightly put in a John at birth didn't belong and then he would blow up things gone but I went to his website and that was blown away because he has written maybe a couple of hundred books that are free anyone go to\nThe ripple effect of\nExtremely cell and just really an amazing amazing man and not only was he a doctor but he was also it just so many different incarnations it makes you realize that we don't really have to die I said to Maine also was walking\nGeorge do you believe that that's possible you can take on a further uh incarnation\nI think as many things are possible ... really

church as a family and we are going to stop stop our sinful ways\nUm that there will be a downside to that somewhere some friend you'll lose some you know something some there's it doesn't matter what you do know how to how good are noble the intentions there's some downsides somebody's gonna be able to point to so if you focus on only the negatives you'll you'll never make any decision no progress no advancement or anything for example\nCar accidents are up slightly slightly skewed me car accidents are up slightly in the states that have legalized\nMarijuana now are those attributable to marijuana or the increased traffic because more people are moving into those states because uh\nWhere do you get it asked his take from a it was on drugs yesterday as a matter of fact\nI mean on drugs

now you're gonna find some study some news article some something that points to some negative aspect of this here's the question you have to ask yourself is\nThe is the is the negative they're talking about outweighing all of the positives that come from very remembering what positive come from legalizing marijuana one of them is\nBig pharma has a mortal stranglehold over people and is addicting people too horrific drugs like bends oh die as a pains in opioids and everything else and you know we have this big war on opioids you know we don't have a war on ...\nWe should we should

you're on LSD\nI have seen my family members do it they'll see things moving around the house that aren't moving they'll sit there and talk ... crazy stuff I mean there's like a whole running joke

splints before bed\nWell if it ... the mind and puts me to sleep\nThe United states and local and state governments been put people in jail for that and if they're ... they made that there but these people need to be compensated for the horrible and the problems that caused all these people they put in jail pot which has been Bal\nBound completely harmless they're doing is on only lack of clown fish do medically beneficial\nYeah they're doing the service of big for most of the big pharma can continue to sell you highly addictive ... highly addictive opioids highly addictive sleep age all these things you don't need if you can just take a little marijuana oil or eat a little marijuana edible and get a good night's sleep and not have pain\nAnd I said the black market went out of

Mike Pompeo will meet today with Mexican officials to try and implement a plan to stop\nThat caravan along the Mexican border we saw more than five hundred federal officers deployed in that\nEffort we'll see what happens last night the president at a rally in Montana thanking the Mexican government for their efforts listen\nI just want to thank the Mexican government because they're stopping it hopefully before it ever gets\nI'm willing to send the military to defend our southern border is that all costs because the illegal immigration onslaught brought\nBy the Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge or to change the laws they like it\nBut here's the thing guys and here's why understanding where I Am right now and that is for hundreds of miles before the Caribbean gets here's the problem this border is already exploding a record number of illegal families crossing more than sixteen thousand last month that\nIs an eighty percent increase since July when you've been history shouldn't reverse their policy on this zero tolerance and get this summer a hundred and seven thousand more than a hundred and seven thousand family members taken into custody and fiscal year twenty Eighteen that shatters the record set in twenty six thing which is just over seven\nAnd they valley sector RG they they are seeing a three hundred percent increase in family units coming since this time last year more than fifty four hundred in just this one station in the last few weeks and countless loads of\nDope the pressure already melting on this border and that's why the president is talking about this being a major issue in the midterms less than a month away guys\nThat was one of the information and that's what I'm going to a break and we'll discuss to ship it to nine to do and we'll be back right after\nWith our money and stop it there and then go back and reinforce the border here and give him some money to stop people from coming up that will put an end to it real fast and everybody will be happy\nOr let's say the or the other update their just happen just sent you a ... which is big he's flying down to Mexico he's there now meeting with President and his counterparts\nDoes the secretary of state's in Mexico city he says that the Mexican government is working in good faith\nTo address this issue thousands of migrants coming north from Central American towards the United states\nHe says the U.S and Mexico or there was a little more work on this they still have work to do to address this issue they also said that he is coordinating with officials from the existing and incoming governments there Mexico's new government takes over December first\nMexico has announced it will return migrants coming through Mexico to their home countries Mexico

welcomes the Mexico United Nations cooperation the secretary arrived in Mexico coming from Panama yesterday\nOkay so this this is what you get paid the big bucks for is to do exactly this is very smart much more ... a very good way of doing this and uh it's a um it's a good political that they're doing on this one\nTwo seven to nine two to eight let me see which way we want to go here Katherine Harris is going to be talking about ... meadows that we bought we talked about on the show yesterday calling for Rosenstein who was on\nTop of rubble hands digging into the Justice Department's conduct before and after the president's election today her again from a former top FBI attorney about whether one of his colleagues sought to undermine President Trump to intelligence corresponded Katherine Harris has that story from Capitol Hill to not\nMiss her bank or did you think the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein was serious about recording the president [noise]\nMr banker will you take our questions\nWhile the FBI's former top lawyer ignored reporters' Republican lawmakers say James Baker did not back away from his October third testimony that he leaves and the attorney general Rod Rosenstein was serious about recording the president in may twenty Seventeen\nLawmakers at Baker was not in the Rosenstein meeting and relied on the accounts from senior FBI officials including then acting at the director Andrew McCabe was fired for lying to federal investigators there was the action\nCase that led bakers believe that this was very serious and that it was moving into an operational phase\nIn a statement Rosenstein said he never authorized the secret recordings and the source in the room said his comments were sarcastic Republicans still want Rosenstein to clear the air with an interview under oath but so far there is no agreement one Republican wins that are either\nIf I was a civil\nInner ear interview posted last night by the wall Street Journal Rosenstein defended the Robert Mueller the special counsel investigation closed people are entitled to be frustrated he said I can accept that\nBut at the end of the day the public will have confidence that the cases we brought were warranted by the evidence and that it was an appropriate use of resources on his own job security quote you serve at the pleasure of the president and there's never been any ambiguity about that in my mind\nJust this apartment official offered a brisk no comments after congressman meadows calling for Rosenstein resignation and the last few minutes we have confirmation that that the attorney general has agreed to a transcribed interview on October twenty fourth will be conducted by the chairman or ranking member of that is ... and oversight committee\nOkay to add to that or ... or is testifying as we speak and she's using spousal privilege to not be able to testify because of her husband Bruce or\n... or ... so that one's going to be curious\nAnd what\nI mean if you got if you have a relationship that is a Justice Department relationship with your spouse outside and you've done something that you're not supposed to do I'm not sure how spousal privilege get you there\nNow because both of privilege and if there's an attorney in order to wants to respond to this but\nI think what it is is that if I'm learning something about my spouse because she is my spouse right you can't testify in other words just because she was not because if I had a business relationship with it so\nIt's like I mean the bulletin boards it's like something he's discussing the butter midnight like you know what I mean I don't mean anything sexual by that I mean it's like it's intimate moments that things you share their spouse you shouldn't have to testify against them\nYou're there's your spouse and the reason there's a there was a kind of a case you study when you're doing financial tax plan and it just goes to\nThat a spouse did before the IRS and said well I Can't talk to you about him about that because of spousal privilege and then they did the same thing for your spouse iris no use on the tax return\nSo you're both on the line and it was not a I was a moment that you both had a business investment interest into each other so they all satellite\nAnd then they would have wanted to do that and the both been involved in

much but um [noise] this is that that's the topic very very interesting to me and I'm\nI'm not at all clear my head that what a port of entry is it ... as it is what's on the U.S border where they process people\nIn other words if you're in the ... there's a port of entry there's there there's ... there's been so all the way around and then there was a board adventure that you can drive through or walk or\nCost um I don't have even hard um but we were definitely rewarding the wrong behavior of the law to be there we catch them inside are stepping across and start to the U.S without doing the proper channels\nThat they're immediately imported and end up to that they need to go to the ... the U.S embassy in their own country to start the process of asking for asylum is what I think ...\nVote both the both of those things would be great but those are the ones that are already slow rage that if you are seeking asylum and you come over the border and you say the true so you can assign um then they most here which are cases\nAll I Know I Know that's the wrong we're rewarding the wrong idea we should have it just the opposite if they if they're here they should\nBe automatically deported if they if they do it properly which they ought to change the law to either be port of entry or your embassy here in our country we're both maybe it's even better or about the embassy in your country then they stand a chance\nBut otherwise that that that ... that we shouldn't reward\nYeah owns ... having worked in a bin ... up a back in their eighties weird we've just totally screwed ourselves over by the way the law was where would they were trying to be compassionate and people took advantage of it and this would be will do to to America\nAt but I'm really really concerned about people being traffic I mean that's the thing you never hear the news I don't know what proportion of these people that are quote bringing\nFamily units bringing children are really trafficking these poor children and I don't think they ought to be deported with your ... that that really bothers me I don't know how to handle that\nWell and one of the things that they're doing now is they're doing DNA testing for the person who says that their parents are asking them up you know who is is this your child who say years we'll know they're doing DNA testing now what they're doing is they're saying well I'm a district cousin because they know they're doing today and I just\nI'm ... [noise] well it it's scary I mean they have to they almost have to separate them to get the children that are probably scared to death to talk to them but they're not don't really belong to those people you know what I mean\nYeah there was a a famous piece of video that happened last spring where\nThe uh the trial was scared of the mom and dad and you can just look at the video and knew that they want their parents knew No Child would act like that and those were really their parents notified overdid it\nRight and you know a lot of times they threaten unless they if you tell us we're going to kill your family\nDo you oh yeah and I'll I'll show a video just recently traffic or he was in the far east he wasn't in in ... in central and South America but this is\nProbably about just as bad he had killed ... four hundred children he did kill them that they tell them that if you ... if you're going to die and he kills them yeah I mean I Am\nAnd that's what they and they may do it on poor families and makes it a little villages and love and the middle east and um\nThey sell them ...\nYeah it was kind of scary isn't it\nAt a lot of times they are telling them they want to marry 'em you know that's one way they always do it young girls if it's awful\nI mean it's every winter it's a billion billion dollar business and nobody talks about how much I don't hear about any of that on the news it's all they talk about his to oh how horrible the bishop pregnant family in it all off what proportion of the family and it's our our family even\nLonger trash can going off you know and they take advantage of all of this awful\nBut you notice the press report says that that's the most disturbing thing to me they're they're reporting there's just so used to or or families that they're going for\nAnd the coach of one of the ... one of the time to drip overstock I mean it just doesn't make any sense I mean they they were clean room and spring which is ... and now they're bringing crime and bow and that's ...\n[laughter] right right well I think it would it would get rid of a lot of the human trafficking if they made them do it in their own country to go to an embassy an image they can probably the they have to have the proper stylistic can research these people\nBut I'm not a whole research all of 'em up the wilds news for they let anybody come in as a quote family unit\nI'm with you put you in Georgia the border patrol\nAnd his first trip overseas as president was this high profile visitor Riyadh lavish theories of advanced in which the kingdom pulled out all the stops for the newly inaugurated later [noise]\nIt was a signal from both countries of the whole relationship punctuated by an agreement to sell the Saudis one hundred ten billion dollars in weapons\nDeal the president says is too important to risk\nIf they don't buy it from us they're going to buy from Russia or they're going to buy it from China or they're going to buy in from other countries\nIt's doubtful the Saudis will move away from Washington\nWhen the dust settles from is the Saudis for corn and want to be closer to stop further away\nNow no us representative will attend this conference next week several top European finance ministers have pulled out I have three of the world's top international banks amid all of this secretary of state Mike Pompeo says keep in mind Saudi Arabia remains quote an important strategic ally\nSo they pulled out of the uh the summit thing and so that's kind of by the way I looked at this place within the summit is just unbelievable the this complex that they were going to be and they have\nThe canals and you walk outside your your room and you have a porch right there in the canal and you bring a boat can pick up their ms ...\nSo let's go to the middle east expert though was on Fox talking about and she she's the ... very attractive lady a crisis with Saudi Arabia Middle East expert talks about it and she's going to lay out some different pieces of that which I thought it was very interesting\nTime for the new showing a degree in with them and and the patients in time in consideration we would like to the independent information that I find ourselves but we remember our relationship with the kingdom is almost a century old\nWe an American president President Roosevelt recognize that the kingdom would district Egypt Klee important even before we knew any oil was present in the kingdom and not about to abandon the kingdom now\nSo they really did I mean they they understood the the geographic significant said that\nThey were little kind of offer known the\nDuring the day or two but we understood where they were and that there would this bridge that you had\nGoing down towards Africa that you had to really pay attention to because all the the one that and they owe them an empire and you had to be careful because of the religious belief that were there so let's continue on with the crisis with Saudi Arabia\nAnd there may be a bone guy\nHeard that from a Mike Pompeo yesterday where he said you know we're going to give them a little more time before the you know so they\nGet as much information and they have been a very important ally of ours as well but it looks like from what we've seen it looks like the crown prince ... ordered ahead on this guy or been somehow involved and there's a story out this morning\nThat apparently or they may blame a top intel officer who is close to him to have him take the fall\nI understand that that they they second scientists look very very negative um I hesitate to make it at any allegations without knowing that we also understand Saudi Arabia is not crown prince Mohammed bin ... protests\nThey think may rule for more than Fifteen Years\nBut the truth and America is one of the exact tremendous influence in the Gulf region and we can't do without the king of the goals of our president and the ... are extremely unified in terms of finding the menace meant ... Iran we know that the pouncing also recognize that the Muslim Brotherhood\nI truly evil and which is how we all the all the while the mother of all ... even though I Would say we have to stand with them and we've landed in this city and it's kind of say nine eleven without any and come through that\nThey ah a Morning Joe today I Wish I had time to pull the rent\nThat he did about the Democrats growing up which is very telling to me but I also do ... talking about there are several members of Congress there was talking about who show that he was a Muslim Brotherhood person and then he also was in bed at at one time with the um\nOsama bin Laden score that was there and so they're kind of saying well he's got dirty hands and some things that are U.S policy\nUm and so they're saying that\nWell you're taking a dead man and you're trying to defame and I think with the point was is that there were just kind of trying to make sure that people who had a whole listing viewpoint that this was not just this angel that was sitting there so now let's continue on with this and talking about the monarch and this is important\nWe've noticed that a number of members of the media are calling in to the question that the president's relationship with the Saudis I think Joe Biden ... a day ago said that a President Trump has a love affair with autocrats I Believe he was talking about the relationship with Assad\nWhy oh why times within performance Biden can account for example in lock the things we live in a world full of Monnett dictators autocratic we deal with him as we we can\nI'm One of the very strong feelings about the crown prince is he\nLooking the economic with ... the kingdom has been in mass exodus as American presence from the Davis and the death of anything but economic were falling off in the beginning of social reforms to the United states should be supporting the king an essay economic with falling for the chemical ...\nAnd that there is an important factor being kind of a history buff [noise]\nYou know it wasn't that long ago you know prior to World War two that that's who you were doing it with your dinner with my nose in Russia in a mine or you know you get a minority in a in a UK but you had a parliament to a city but most of those folks were kings and monitor that were there\nWell and I was making a pointless I Do and you're talking about giving this holistic picture I guess as you say let's say ... or ... or ... called for freedom of the president is last article in the Washington Post put out there\nAnd I just find it ironic that turkey is the country say ... frying foul here with the death 'cause turkey especially in the last few months and years ... has become the most restrictive country in terms of freedom of the press\nLike I guess we like them because they walk up their journalists instead of killing\nIt it's bad under and there could have had um people who go over there for a mission work could talk about it\nAnd they said it is it is not good they they were constantly being followed and whoa sorts of stuff\nKnow you had your first break and or in something we'll get to the story where turkey says something that was not accurate they said that ... had heard the tape and ... said no I haven't heard that tape\nThe no I haven't seen transcript in Turkey just get out now kind of misrepresented that\nAnd that's it just seemed like they were exaggerating from the get go I think he's he's obviously he's dead and somebody killed him for his views but a turkey is trying to play this up as much as I can for their own at that and\nSo now we're going to keep on going with this individual talking about um this looks bad but you know what it is bad\nA lot of people said look there's all this evidence apparently that we've gotten for turkey it looks like the royal family somehow involved Saudi Arabia looks really bad but the president's demeanor and his approach has been okay it looks bad but let's wait until we find out exactly where the chips fall\nIn it's not any ... bad and they did it in bad how as a um we uh\nWe recognize that they've ... has centralized power more than many previous ... we're not going to move ahead without him and the United states is not in the business has selecting adds to the Saudi trained and that's not what we do uh\nBut I think it's high time for the United states to push ... goals in the range and now maybe we can say to Saudi Arabia we want you to stand would they even more than me again they have against Hezbollah and maybe we want to push Saudi Arabia really to see a piece dilution and Israel and Palestine so there are many things we can gain and remember\nThat was like gaining from the humiliation of a kingdom tacky I tell in Iran who's goals I'll sometimes counted because out of the United states but don't forget that\nAnd that's exactly yeah exactly it and we're member of their students to do the the problem in Saudi Arabia their problem is with the person that called in they hit ...\nAnd if that is the ground perenich then that's an easy solution if it is the ... with the kings blessing that could be a big problem but I
