didn't put back into place ... runs ... even if a sweet ... sadly left you a mayonnaise jar full a hundred dollar bills yeah he might she might do it you never know\nThe thing is you can make more money than you can eat the bank people say well now he's he's knocking banks no I'm not I got money in the bank man you should have money in the bank you shouldn't have all your money he had to buy you should not have most of your money in the back if you got some\nYou need to have a lot more maybe maybe in something that makes more money than the bank and safe\nAlso this is this is why I'm going to James browns house oh yeah yeah there was a special on about it and the other day\nAnd uh he I don't know a lot of people do there's not he was in the end of his life he was heavy into PCP who he was smoking the PCP I've heard of it and it makes you paranoid and they said they had spent on and said James buried so much money around this house we don't know we still don't know where it all is\nWell I was thinking about maybe you know might get rich quick schemes to sneak up James Brown house and go in as a loan inspector\nI have to dig some polls desert just to see you know what kind of problems that got involved they oh look a Mason jar full of money that 'cause that's what the problem is well you know funny you say the word paranoid mhm here\nYou know that old saying back in World War two you have nothing to fear but fear itself\nFear is what keeps you from doing what you should be doing fry you put the money in the bank you don't put it somewhere else you don't know about David artists and the other alternatives you think you're thinking between the bank and the stock market\nThere's another alternative that uses the stock market but he's not in completely in the stock market the stock market falls you don't lose a dime you don't lose a painting you just sit there\nAnd then if he tries to recover the next year or two then you could make money again when everybody else is just trying to get their money back mhm okay and this stuff is safe it has\nIt's with the insurance companies they backed up by insurance companies and it's never lost a penny that we know of that I Know of a in this in this kind of scenario if you do it right\nNow if you're sitting there at your house here in the car maybe I don't know maybe you might be laying down about to take a nap and got the radio on I don't know what you hear David talking about all these things and boy I sure as interesting but I still don't really understand exactly what he's talking about well before you not off before you part of the car whatever you're doing\nAnd that to you need to know you can get in touch with David several ways was phone numbers to seven or seven for three warn\nYou can share ah check out his Web site at retire with our news dot com\nDave is on Facebook you can go over there to his Facebook page at health and wealth with David artist\nLike the Facebook page and click on the link to David YouTube channel we've got a bunch of our older programs in comedy stuff on there but this is going to do some good this is going to help you on your quest for financial stability in the future and after all as Chris Wells says\nThe future is where we're going to spend the rest of our lives exactly he did say that in her future is where we're going to spend\nThe rest of our lives and do you think for one minute\nThat the stock market's not going to do some adjusting if not dramatically into the south\nPole range well ... it's a ... what's the word it's a cyclical I mean there's going to say look it's been doing it for years and then there's gonna be a a correction\nBut think of this list two thousand nine is going up for a hundred percent and you know that's great yeah Cain\nHold off that much longer I mean it it it's it's\nLike if you had been with me is two thousand nine and we had gone up say sixty Seventy percent of the more hundred percent to\n... and if the market crashes that sixty or Seventy percent of that four hundred percent ... don't go away but let's say you're in the four hundred percent and it cuts in half are worse\nAnd now years you're going oh my God\nHow am I going to deal with is cutting in half if that was what happened I'm not saying that's what's gonna happen by any means nobody knows what's gonna happen but the good lord but common sense to tell you that if we've gone up four hundred percent\nHow much more we're gonna go exactly the full with something happens Donald Trump's in doing a heck of a good job how alone can one horse carry more and more load\nYou got one horse that's a strong horse it's a smart 'course you keep putting sandbags on my horse on top of one of their own top one somewhere that horse is going to say enough is enough I Can't carry the world on my shoulders man\nDonald Trump cannot carry the stock market for ever nobody can the companies can only do so good to carry the stock the stock market is the is the companies the the corporations of the United states and the world it his business\nHow long can it be if you want to call it ... how long can this continued do you do you not think for one second go read the experts that have predicted this in the past there most of them not all but most of them are saying\nGet ready get ready\nMhm don't be late for that train it's going to leave the station\nAnd you know the boy scouts be prepared\nFor a very simple be primary I'd like to lock the grasshopper and add a little ant was prepared grasshoppers out playing don't be the grasshopper beta and make sure you get things straight and in order for when there was lean times come and I hate to say it they will\nWell everybody has a ... I'm not knocking the people who do the stocks of not not the people who do the ... ... I've done all that and all that\nAnd I can still do some things but the thing is is that I Am and protection mode right now my every body part I'm about everything in my soul says if you have accumulated some ... don't have it out their neck it\nIn the market have something candidate in the in something where the market goes up but if it goes up\nWe're we're we're protected from the crash we've got to get you a T shirt says asked me about naked wealth [laughter]\nAre you asking you about that they'd be stopping you in the mall and then I Will tell you I like that make it will tell them that should be the ... the name of your book when you ride and you don't have wires that are hot in without being insulated but I Know you learn just set something on fire and get her to get her up and everything it's just not good right so we hadn't said enough in his radio show we\nOr the catch and release the let local law enforcement she see how that comes from federal law enforcement and doesn't know the basic provisions of the constitution for federal law enforcement\nAnd what she's really saying there and this is what the Democrats are saying is forget about federal law do not follow the law of the land the rule of law is outdated or we're just going to make it up as we go and that that is a very dangerous new direction or that are\nNo Americans want to move in that direction and so what we got some huge challenges healthcare you know they want the\nBernie Sanders thirty two trillion dollar a socialist healthcare peace and ending Medicare is you know with double tax rates personal and corporate ... put you an automatic recession depressions so that that's the direction that it it's just like you said it forward versus backward\nHere's what I see happening on the left and I would imagine that young people don't like to be told what they can and cannot speak about like issues that they just are not allowed to to address any longer because if you say you want our borders and force then\nHere for a mass shooter [laughter] I mean it's most ridiculous thing I've ever heard but this is what the left is absolutely trying to do they are trying to take your shoes off the table\nThat Trump connects on and one of them that you connected on early on and you were way ahead of the curve on this\nWas the issue of immigration or the sense that we have a sovereign right oh God given right to determine who comes in our country and why they come in and set the terms and set the rules and the last one they want they want is kind of\nTake those issues away in a neutralized tromp on the campaign trail in probably neutralize people like you\n[noise] [noise] yeah and and that won't work immigration you know he's a Seventy to eighty percent issue the Democrats are being told\nNot to mention it right by all the head honcho there's an article in the hill yesterday the Democrats you know just are just sarcastically\nCaving on these issues and just saying no well we don't have we don't have a party platform to run on why starting out there that cynical they know they have not offered a platform on any issues in immigration is I think the issue especially in my district and so yeah you're right that the kids were loading up what Twenty one trillion in debt\nAnd then catch and release you know these are all children of God coming across the border right like the Catholics are good people in there but there are other people that have not been vetted and all that any family that comes in with two kids that's twenty six thousand dollars to go to school for one year\nAnd who's paying that bill right so you run those basic issues by that by the taxpayer and by the kids and say you're paying off is that you know we're putting all of this on your credit card you're going to pay it off\nAnd do we don't do a good enough job communicating to the next generation a ...\nWrote the economy I taught college for Twenty years last the Obama period a high end college graduates couldn't go out and find a decent job\nNow it it's just day and night they big time is just boom and the kids are getting multiple job offers wants to just what's really interesting it's just the job ... ... people are leaving their jobs because they're confident they can go get a better job it's been a long time since that's happened and so\nAre the kids are moving up the the wage chain you know it it it it it's just great news and so we ... we got to share that with everybody\nBut there is a group that is just dug in on the resistance right we're offer a result\nThey want to resist like you said right they want to have enlisted best occasions they want to pitch the president Paige cabin all my opponent won't come down on any of\nThat of course not so what is she in fact I mean you know the question out asking his final final days why why she hiding why why is that why is your challenger\nMitt spanberger hiding on these king issues that they the voters in Virginia and deserve to know the truth about what she really believes about the changing nature of of the state the the economic burdens being laid at the feet of the taxpayers are Virginia\nBut she's answering in these ... or ... to make us every everyone's going to feel good but that's not how the real world works she needs to answer these questions and why she hiding\nI Would keep saying that we're in why she hiding\nRight when one of the things she tired and came out months ago and of course the mainstream press a let her hide but sure where I worked at a uh somebody\nA school she calls it an embassy school the only problem with that there is the U.S government shut it down under Chuck Schumer and congressman Israel because he was a anti Semitic anti American anti woman\nThere was a far right while hobby fundamentalists Saudi training school that produce terrorists\nAnd after the fact she says she's still proud that she worked there like you said if you're proud of the fact that you worked at this school that is they hate school then why didn't you put that on your resume she's hiding everything she tried to her policy platform she's hiding her position on healthcare\nImmigration taxes she won't talk about in public because you know they're losers with the people of the ... district at the porch and yet\nI Want to play in the ... I Want to play by play this is from Joe Lockhart Clinton's old press secretary again words in subjects that they want to take off the table before the midterm vote let's listen\nA still talking about global is um which is a dog whistle for a for a in the semi he's still going after George Soros another dog was over anti Semite Donald Trump doesn't change um he might have moments where he reads the paper in front of him but he will change I mean if if\nIf the largest slaughter of American Jews in American history won't change his attitude and his rhetoric nothing will\nWell I got it it it sounds different from Joe Lockhart but it's someone who was on CNN with Allison ... ah but I don't think that was ... and that's the sense that you can't say the word global list well why not I mean\nThat the lessons use the word global is plenty of times but again they are the ... one day if they want to take the college speech code mentality and force it upon society at large in that way they fix all the debates\nYeah the the left is very good and this goes back decades right they are training manuals they try to take your strength away from you and take away your strongest points right my strongest point is Iran as an outsider I voted that way right my small business score is a hundred percent\nAnd uh I had the support of all the the small business folks across my district et cetera I did around all the county\nOh get around and not being paid off by big farm but because of an Obamacare vote and so\nYou're you're right that talking point is right they're very smart on how to shift the language they do not want to have a policy debate if your policy debate would win at Ninety that they have to ship that off to the politics of personal destruction have a hard time with me 'cause I went to seminary that no I Love everybody\nAnd so they have a hard time shifting the ground that way I mean and so now they're just running crazy falls commercials that you know the biggest thing I Can't believe with a national media it it it's it's just ... the house voted for pre existing conditions right to help people with preexisting condition\nIt passed the house and that's the number one issue the left is running on saying we're against it after that was the biggest bill of the year last year but you can't cut down on dream fake news in unreal\nNow well Dave Brat a is a is a classic independent thinking Virginia and the type of person who the voters of the seventh district badly need representing them and Washington someone who will not be cowed\nBy the threats from the left and who knows how uh how injurious it is to the American people to have\nOutside influences trying to shut down free speech and threaten people and intimidate people away from speaking their mind uh Dave Brat a I Know you're going to win this day if it's seven congressional districts everybody get out there and vote in Virginia\nA and a congressman Dave Brat has been fighting for the American worker and fighting for uh the people in this incredible\nCommonwealth of Virginia now for years and we just wish you the best of luck Dave if we don't talk to you before Tuesday next Tuesday a we'll talk to a ... or a victory party\nGod Bless you for all you do Lorna people want to go check it out is Dave Brat dot com it's a nice red button that can hit send a few bucks or give me over the finish\nLiar I day brat dot com everybody go their help 'em out if it's five dollars twenty five dollars or more we want your help I you're listening to the lower income show stay there the Laura Ingraham show\nOut today on DVD and Blu ray from number one New York times best selling author diminished as soon as it comes his latest film death of a nation with one week before the midterm elections this is the most important film you'll see before you cast your vote\nPunishes back and better than ever with his explosive examination of America today and what could happen if the Democrats take back Congress this film as a wake up call for every American death of a nation on DVD and Blu ray today get your copy now at death of a nation movie dot com that death of a nation movie dot com\nOr your word your identity could be held hostage should be because ransomware does exactly the this is Tom Kelly studio among auditor making every American safer from the effect of R D served as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from room somewhere to back up your computer often\nIf you have questions about identity theft and even if you're struggling with fraud today my id care can help\nSame day as well known for thirty\nMake your home look great for ...

K. doesn't allow it Spain doesn't allow it France doesn't allow it candidate does allow it\nIt's other than the United states the only really advanced economy that allows his bingo automatic citizenship and Trump brings it up and it's uh we'll see where it goes but I think I could just as a matter of common sense setting aside constitutional\nA language which it does not require a what the left claims that it requires\nA it's it's open to debate\nSo fascinating subject are joining us now mark\nKrikorian also get to your calls eight five five forty Laura I'm Mark Krikorian is going to sell some of this forest Mark I'm\nThe president brings this up I yesterday and the media with their\nLove and response are basically saying oh how dare he how dare he dog whistle dog whistle wants\nExpect and quite frankly but uh the president is a I mean I think this is a smart move I haven't seen the executive order hasn't been issued yet but what I assume it is is that he is interpreting\nA clause within the fourteenth amendment in such a way as to not automatically give citizenship to kids born to tourists\nOr foreign students are illegal aliens that phrase\nA it's complicated to get on the radio but it's called subject to the jurisdiction thereof that phrase is ambiguous Supreme Court has never ruled on it there's never been any legislation saying that's what this means so it's perfectly appropriate in fact long overdue\nFor the president to say this is my interpretation what's gonna happen if somebody's going to sue it's going to end up before the Supreme Court and then we'll have a ruling one way or the other about whether the kids born to tourists are\nUm are or illegal aliens are automatically citizens or not and depending on how they rule then whoever doesn't like it can you know try to do something that I have a constitutional amendment or something but it but the only way to get this process even started\nIs for the president to do this to issue an executive order and what it means is that the state department won't issue passports for instance to kids born to Chinese burst tourists could women who um and then somebody will sue way seal you will find one of them they'll sue nobody lawsuit that's this is\nUm you know whenever you think about this issue ... whatever you think the policy should be this is the smart\nWay to keep up the issue so we can move it along in the process of you know public debate because we're all we're doing now is saying well I think that this senator and Eighteen sixty eight meant X and somebody says no this other senator and Eighteen sixty eight meant why when the amendment was passed\nThat is pretty sterile that's not getting us anywhere this really is I think moving the ball forward regardless of what you think of the issue I think this is a smart move on the part of the president\nI completely agree we have to get this thing resolved I mean this Long Beach birth motels a Florida birth mother tells the Chinese and Russians Mexican south Americans is becoming a booming business just in Russia alone\nOr and they ... around on the other restrictions on on what we want from Russian uh investment in the United states by suddenly you have a kid who has a passport and your golden at your gold and a\nKid as as a kid has a passport\nHe can go to a for instance UC Berkeley at um lower rates that's one of the reasons they're people from Korea and turkey who do this as a way of helping their kids dodged the draft once they get older because they can just hop on a plane and go to the United states and then\nThey don't have ... ... it's a retirement plan for some people\nBecause you know you're having a kid at thirty well by the time your kid is an adult and has a job and is working if uh you know you want you can sponsor you for immigration so that when you were finished working retire in the United states I mean there are a bunch of different reasons people do this\nNone of which is in the interest of the United states\nNow it's it's fast saying we're going to stay on this issue and a lot more a Mark Krikorian thank you so much for what you do from the center for Immigration Studies will take a break we're going to highlight one of the key congressional races that as a winnable seat in New Jersey stay there\n\nToday on DVD and Blu ray from number

healthy living is important which so his pain if you have\nA and we're delighted to talk to him J uh this is a tight race and your opponent making Cheryl ... is hoping to keep the corruption machine don't I guess in New Jersey just keep that keep the liberal liberal party rule going\nIn that they're playing certainly I mean anytime you support Bob and ended up for reelection boy that says a lot about where you want to take the country and and what you think of congressional ethics\nTell us what happened ah yeah I Know you and your family or have been targeted because simply the mere fact that you're a Republican and your solid a fiscal conservative running in the state of New Jersey but you've been subjected to threats yourself\n[noise] yeah we did I mean we got we got a letter somebody slashed up our lawn signs stuck in an envelope and then\nUh enclosed with a a a letter suggesting that ah my seven children would be lucky if I were to win and uh it was you know disturbing a law enforcement's been fantastic uh they're on the case of making the kids feel really really safe and secure\nAnd my wife and I look at each other's or what do we do about it but we're going to make sure the kids are safe and then\nSome ... ah you know drop things in the mail and then a hides so we're going to keep pushing forward and it's the only way to deal with it just push back in stand up for yourself so that's what we're doing\nThe district in which you're running a the eleventh is a tough district Trump one by one percent of the media and the last the resistance are geared up their jacked up\nTo try to run the tables and congressional races and run it against the president despite the strong economy the fundamentals of this economy are incredibly strong\nA and despite the fact that consumer confidence optimism small business unemployment all of these numbers are incredible what are you finding out there on the trail and could be a meaty a conclusion about this uh this type of district the wrong\nI've slowly it's wrong because the leftist jacked up so early and you'd always jacked up the taxpayers to be getting screwed in New Jersey for years and they do it and they understand it and the state has gotten more and more on affordable\nWith every democratic governor frankly the Democratic legislature around here Jack it up taxes every chance they get so\nUh that's our message or measures let's continue to grow this economy let's cut taxes are the people know that a Democrat from New Jersey is not going to Congress to cut their tax is just not going to happen it doesn't happen in Trenton it's not going to happen in Washington and\nAnd that's the distinction were drawn and people respond to that because it's their felt experience for decades they've watched Democrats\nTaxes around here and then blame somebody else in Washington it's not going to work we're going to Washington to to grow this economy and its support the president's agenda which is working for the country\nAnd you and your wife I think are both uh lawyers or your your I Know you're a lawyer you just you're going to graduate and back in two thousand ah went to that now that it's a it's an it's an okay schools Harvard law school but not as good as where I went to Virginia thank you very much but a\nMyth yeah they're very much field hockey that's all I can say\nJay you practicing law you have a great life is beautiful family and then you decide to get into this monkey world the politics got in their mind that you want to put yourself through this mess\nWell this is great service by the way my my wife and I were classmates at Harvard law so we are ... ... she's a ... a wonderful wonderful thirty a\nLawyer I dislike link code in existence here in Morris county we're observing my clients\nAre litigating cases go into court arguing the judges and and adversaries are and I serve in the state legislature and it's a part time position and and uh it's a great balance or you know we're going to the kids' baseball games and and all that stuff and and it's it's real good it's a good life\nBut congressman ... and retired uh were announced his retirement in January and the seat is just too important\nTo not get involved Johanna and I decided that uh we we're not going to sit on the sidelines\nA in a year's critical as this and come November six come next Tuesday we're not going to watch the returns come in and not know that we didn't do everything we possibly could for our country to expand opportunity and continue to grow this economy keep us safe\nAbroad and reform those immigration policies you've been talking about so uh we were we went all in because the country's worst than ... people have been asked to make bigger sacrifices and is to keep our country strong and free and so if that's what we have to do this year to help our country and all and that's what we're going to do\nWhen you look at the national\nDebate and a and the Democrats have funneled millions and millions of dollars into voter outreach registration getting people to the polls have you gotten\nRepublicans and they are insane and others to do the same for the Republican side\nThey are and see the honor Sisi the White House they've all been supportive of the president has\nEndorsed bay and a fundraiser for me vice president Pence has helped me twice a Speaker Ryan has been into a rally\nYou're always a would welcome more help 'em but they've been helpful they they know the seat is important and frankly they're spread pretty thin this year so um we get it we're fighting hard and uh we're in a north Jersey district that as winnable\nAnd we plan on delivering a major upset to one of the Democrat's hand picked\nCandidates Sheera that do but a lot of money and against us but uh it's a good district in good people around here who know which way they want to take the country that is lower taxes\nAs well and there's this New Jersey people you hear about New Jersey and and and it's it's always a bunch of the jokes are in in New Jersey a beautiful state\nThere is at all much natural beauty and the state of New Jersey I live just for one year and New Jersey after after college I I Lived in a Princeton knows editing a alumni publication there and so I had a chance to travel the state and I didn't know it at all I Know nothing about New Jersey\nActually fall in love and New Jersey it's a great place but it has been badly served by corrupt leaders corrupt leadership in mostly in the Democratic side of the equation and the fact that\n... mind to Menendez I mean come on and everything in between you got to have some level headed people in the U.S Congress\nYet at the plant we want we want to go down there and serve and help help uh what is a beautiful state you're right um but you know there's nothing wrong with New Jersey\nThe new leadership and better leadership can't fix came out of all the natural resources we have incredibly smart tough hardworking

I'm fifty six percent I'm the one thing though is that I started talking to my friends about what I'm doing\nAnd they are just they're like are you crazy you're a single woman well how could you only have two thousand dollars in anything why are you [noise] you know trying to attack their student loans they're only federal loans than I that\nI've even heard some of my friends say that you know and first comes toward you can move out of the country and not pay your debt or or\nOr your friends multi millionaires\n\nNo [laughter] not grow up what they think about money you're going to take so\nMuch from broke people [laughter] some yeah dumb\nI Know I Know it's I it's crazy that some of the things that the fed like moving out of the country\nAnd ... they're broke\n[noise] yeah but I'm Wondering\nI select saying that's like saying I'm overweight and I'm going to lose weight and I'm actually doing it and all my overweight friends were making fun of my plan\nAnd I know you recommend putting Fifteen Percent into retirement I worked for the local fire department and I have a pension plan do I need to say Fifteen Percent over and above that or count\nAs part of it well what I tell folks is that you need to put Fifteen Percent and most of the time and a pension plan you're not putting in anything\nAnd you don't have any control over what happens with the pension plans you don't choose the investments you don't get to um\nYou know if the ... municipality in your case is poorly run they could break the pension plan it's happened before doesn't happen very much but\nNo I think you need to be voting Fifteen Percent of your income away in Roth IRA raise route four oh one K. is whatever you got to do along those lines\nAnd and that's the thing I Would tell you that the reason is is that what you've got that's money you choose where it invested and if somebody mishandles something at work it doesn't mess up your four one K. it doesn't mess up your Roth IRA you are controlling your destiny are not waiting on someone else\nThe people you work for it affects your life\nThat's a big deal Johns in Pittsburgh hey John welcome to the day Ramsey show how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm great um reason I'm calling is here's my question um my wife is sixty five I'm sixty two versions now into getting on the ... on my feet and saved up mhm\nAnd now we're looking for a new place to live the house was rent right now is just way too big for my wife and I both got bad knees bad backs them up and down the stairs and pain than about all the time okay um my question is\nUm the rentals around this area now are skyrocketing because there's new cracker plant going in so people are coming in from out of state sucking all those ... ... [noise] but I found a couple of houses that I could purchase\nAnd the pay my rent right now is eight Seventy five a month or my payment would drop to about six hundred and thirty dollars come up mhm [noise]\nUm the other part of it is [laughter]\nA when I retired from the post office I rolled my ah through savings plan into an IRA good that I can borrow enough for him right now with Egypt can be able to put ... percent down on the house so I wouldn't have to pay the P. M. i.'s law mhm you know just\nLike you and you're seeing them either I don't you don't want any per se or\nNo you're you're here aren't turning your two broke to buy a house here in ... you're in debt you get your borrowing against your retirement I mean you're straining at every corner to pull this off okay um and besides that you if you're moving from an eight Seventy five rental to six hundred dollar payment you're moving down in the house substantially\nSo we're going to move down and how substantially moved down to a different rental and let me tell you if the rental market is squeezed because of a plant that has come in the buying market is squeezed as well\nSo what you're telling me is not logical you're using this as a rationalization to buy out of order\nI if I were you when you call me and I ask what you should do I would rent something else move out of that rental moved to a cheaper rental that'd be fine\nAh for a short period of time that while you clean up your debt your debt free you build your emergency phoned up three to six months of expenses then you have a good down payment and you can do all of that and a few years if you're careful and watch what you're doing and then make your purchased\nBut ah when you buy a house and you're broke you're asking for trouble I mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bringing his three cousins broke desperate and stupid owning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse\nRather than a blessing\nSteven is in Virginia Beach I ...\nAre you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI don't want to know what would be a martyr if it'd be a right now I have a higher rate and my name and I know you can only put five thousand five hundred ... a year yesterday hypothetically\nAt me and my wife only had ... mouth that amount of money five thousand five hundred it go toward them the best thing would that be smarter to put all of it into my rock hire a as is\nOr should I open up a lot from my in my wife's name and then ... uh five thousand five hundred and put two thousand seven hundred and fifty in each of them and watch them grow that way\nWhat's your household income or a household income and fifty thousand okay Mm\nSo Fifteen Percent of that going in and buy beast of four into retirement is more like a\nTen thousand no it would be more like Seventy five hundred okay um\n[noise]\nAnd so you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some it it doesn't matter uh which one you do mathematically let's say you chose the exact same mutual fund and you put\nThree thousand in more than three thousand in another okay morning not one Roth IRA and your name one Roth IRA and her name or are um\nYou put six thousand in the same mutual fund it's going to grow exactly the same so it really doesn't matter uh\nHe'll I even had like a thousand dollars I can I could open up one would have five hundred in my name and five and unheard of you the exact\nExactly it doesn't it doesn't have you any mathematical advantage whatsoever [noise] the only advantage is just a relational\nIn that if she feels like that you know you're fully funding mirrors and she's not got anything for retirement which is not true because if you ever got divorced or died or anything else she's going to get half of that money even if it is and your name\nOkay as I was just not true but sometimes people just you know like she just wants to them and her name that's okay so you could do half and half if you want you need to get to the point you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement that's baby steps for\nAnd that would be after you were out of debt and after you had your emergency fund them ... which may be why\nYou don't have the money right now\nAnd that's why we put baby step for after getting out of bed\nAfter having emergency if I went to the folks temporarily not to save for retirement till you clear your dad's that way you have the money to put Fifteen Percent away and a Fifteen Percent is more than one Roth IRA for you guys but conceptually if you just even if you did Seventy five hundred thirty seven hundred fifty bucks each\nThat'd be fine or if you didn't fifty five hundred and two thousand and the other name that's fine if they're in the same mutual fund you're going to get the exact same results whether you split it or not doesn't change a thing\nAnd James is with us in Fort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nGood thank you for taking my call sure what's up\nUh my wife and I are planning to home next year and ... had a little trouble deciding or or agreeing on the house with them or to get [noise] okay I'm a I'm leaning towards getting a fixer upper\nThere'll be a cheaper house with lower mortgage payment ... and that gives me the opportunity to learn\nLearn how to do those how repairs myself ...\nShe wants to move on ready house\nMhm occur and it'd be your first home\nThey are sick at all and we had a house in a while ago and then we moved and we've been rent printing or well over a year now you know\nThe other home that you had was at a fixer upper\nIt was not able to live and ready ...\nA bar or we have two kids you know and I don't know hassle rented a house mhm I didn't want anything major just out there some minor cosmetic type of more can you do it for you moved in\nA financial aid I'll think we'd be able or grant and a mortgage\nNo I'm saying oh yeah okay so what you're saying that you use the fixer upper would take a few months may be and you wouldn't have to do that I got you\nI'm a part time real estate agent how I live in a house or two years and then turn around and call it I can tell it tax free\n... or any word at my goal because so much for any wind tall they're they're real estate I just saw how stocks were first residents will be limited to your ...\nGrowth on that anyone for anybody [noise] um\nWrong answer but this is just a question of what you guys want to endure\nWe are homeless topsy turvy because it's being renovated all the time I get home to a valid point on hers you're not going to make as much money on it to your point and so\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches are being recorded every day and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy though I've seen first hand when people are stressed\nAnd freaked out when they become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans find out really quake how unprotected they are in so many ways that's why ...\nSays Anders id theft plant to our benefit package was such a smart move the Sanders plan covers all types of ID theft takes over all the work and even covers your bank account if it gets act\n... yeah then that she's probably All right without the survivor benefit [noise] because that's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that\nInvested ... percent will be forty grand so that that's pretty good you're in\nGood shape and you can probably do it this way um I Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\nYour ear in a way above average shape I'm In good shape is is is way above normal because normal just sucks okay you got to weigh redder than most people but\nLiving on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life for the next forty years is going to get old and you don't really have any income coming in other than that because your investments are big enough to create it and so I\nWould you know how you can do it you can do it but I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\nI'm considered that I thought about it for health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of these men to share programs do you\nSee how this is not driving this for me for what's driving it for me is you don't have much\nMoney right and you got the pension but I understand you know think about what what are\nYou know forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing yeah nothing\nThat's the problem with got here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being able to live and we can figure out how you could live in other words if you had a million dollars a mutual funds this\nBecomes like a no brainer instead you got like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe even a scrape everything together after the failed a rental properties and you know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what my what I'm thinking is and and again you can do whatever you want to I'm just talking it through with you OK I'm not saying you're you're you're you're wrong\nOr your bat or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing is and so I probably would think about what we always called an encore career and say what could you do that would be really fun\nThat you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years and you didn't enjoy doing it start a business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank\nAnd bank all of it and health insurance as part of the day I don't care if you're working for somebody else you start a business but just do something what you're doing out and make you smile anymore so you need to get out of there\n[laughter] you picked up on that huh [laughter] yeah and so you know but I but I mean when you're ... you're young you have a lot of uh a lot of\nService to humanity left inside of you that you could get paid for ideas concepts things you could do I don't know what it is but it's something that just I mean I I'm just a little bit older than you I'm fifty seven and do not plan on work\nIt's not 'cause I Need money I don't need any money I got money coming up my ears but uh I'm working because I have a blast you ought to find something like that\nAnd then you can work in the hunt and fish and work and hunt and fish and farm and you know but but you know I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next eight years and have fun doing it that's what I'm saying that's a that's the only challenge I've got it\nDo more than hunting and fishing that\nNot that that's more by this not you've earned the right to do that and you should get out of the place you're getting outta but what's your encore career you take a bow and you come back onto the stage for the encore that's what the encore careers and a lot of people in like a lot of money on that Richard\nSo and and it's not that money's everything but I I just want you to have a little more bad between you and Murphy\nThen this scenario gives me here and I think there's some magic left inside of you\nThat we all need still that's what I'm saying and it might be you take a year and you do nothing behind treasure and farm\nThen usually at the end of that year I'm going to go to ... and that's okay but but Ninety for for the next four years oh you're going to get tired of fishing [laughter]\nYou know our friendship [laughter] so find something makes you smile again that's all I'm saying\nSo uh I'm gonna send you a

on a pickle\n\nFine and yourself better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nWell the reason I'm calling today it's the talk about bankruptcy so my wife and I combined we have about a hundred and thirty four thousand dollar than that I'm\nA hundred thousand is student loans and the balance of the a credit card debt we recently met with a financial advisor and they suggested that we filed for bankruptcy because they would take a long time to pay off the bat they suggested that\nSaying that it will be better for us to start fresh and I just wanted a second opinion\nWhat is your household income sure\nA combined it for about eighty five\nOkay you have any car debt\n... mhm I'm no we don't our cars are paid off okay what are your car's worth um [noise] I Would say about twenty thousand combined okay All right well\nHere's the facts that the quote unquote financial advisor didn't know um apparently or he wouldn't have given you such stupid but advise student loans are not bankrupt double\n\nHere we've been talking about that during the conversation they never go away but he was just thinking in terms of the amount of credit card that we have\nBob ... really have a lot of demand wait a minute there's more on the suggested your bankrupt was thirty four thousand dollars or the credit card debt with a household income of eighty five thousand that's absurd dude\nThat's what I was thinking\nThat's absurd because the ... the the hundred thousand dollars for a student loan doesn't change anything because it's going to be there regardless if it's not a bankrupt ... so we're dealing with you're going to file bankruptcy I'm thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five no you should pay it off in one year\nAnd a year yeah one year live on safety\nPay it off in one year take six extra jobs sell so much stuff you can't breeze no eating out no vacations and you're a hundred percent debt free in one year\nWhat are your car's worth\nEach um\nHer a new or ... or the owners of five hours are working are hers is worth what Thirteen thousand mine is about forever\nMhm okay well\nYou can do what you want to do or if I woke up in your shoes I have to tell you I've worked with families that were in dire straits over the years that were forced into bankruptcy you're not one of those\nIf you choose to file bankruptcy just cause you to dead young lazy to address the situation let's even say you did it over two years it's only Seventeen five a year\nAnd your debt free other than your student loans and I'm not talking about the student loans will be gone in one year I'm Talking about the credit card data began in one year\nSo how fast in normal people that call the Dave Ramsey show that work our plan pay off a hundred and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five about four years probably\nAbout four years yeah\nThat's the normal routine for people around here that would be student loans and everything and um you know I I Would not move down in car initially\nOut of your wife's car into a into a six thousand dollar or five thousand dollar car initially I might end up doing that as we go along we'll see how it goes what do you do for a living sir\nI'm operations manager\nI'm okay and what does she do for a living\nThrough the pastor okay All right cool\nUm does she ever do any outside speaking for money\nI'm no matter where they're about a gun or does she do speaking Miami's does she speak on Sunday mornings yes he does I think they're just under okay All right\nUm and I wonder if if you know she might fail do some ... occasionally for somebody that was ill or on sabbatical or something in that congregation pay or a little bit or\nMaybe she works in an evangelist outrage and they pay or a little bit first baking skills or maybe dot dot dot you do something I don't know I mean if you add ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation\nOf income and you guys tightened down your budget and nothing I mean nothing where you have no life because we're going to clean this mess up you know you can clean up the whole thing and for years maybe three\nBut four for sure uh any clear up those student loans really really really fast as a part of that equation I'm\nSorry though that credit card debt as a part of that equation really really fast but you've got to cut them up you've got to quit using them and you gotta stop living the way you been living 'cause it's not working agreed\nOn despair does that make sense yes I'm like you know\nThe Bible says that no discipline seems pleasant at the time but it yields harvest of righteousness you guys make good money so I Know you're not stupid people\nNot dumb ... they're not dumb he just been doing some dumb things which makes you just like most of it was added a lot of

I mean it's a house that everyone would love to live and it's you know I'm not going to be able to see the sun to come up with the Atlantic every morning but I can live without that\nYeah and ... and again it doesn't have to be permanent and it's not like oh it's a great house so we're just going to relax I that's the thing I don't want to do here I don't want to just accept defeat\nI don't mind moving down you know pulling back to get back behind the wall and but now we're going to fight again we're back behind the wall you know we we can you know we're not taking fire were not you know we've got we're back undercover again okay with brick treat enough to get undercover in the battle but we're not gonna as we're not going to surrender\nTo the to that we want to take that ground back again someday\nBut for today are for the next two years or whatever it takes to turn it around absolutely I'd make this move definitely make that move it all sounds very logical to me good question I ride Derek with us in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Derek welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThey know in his honor to talk to you then have you too sir how can I help\nYou or your total moneymaker her book or just changed our lives they got it as a wedding gift and it was the best wedding gifts we implemented it and pay off twenty thirty thousand dollars a day ... months and then ... free sense so it's been awesome God\nI'm by question to you need your help with this because sometimes I feel like I'm controlled by the year and over stinking when do you quit your day job which is good to go fulltime entrepreneur\nDo you have the full time job or do you have the entrepreneur gig running\n[noise] yeah that's what my wife does she sells the clothing for that little row um and she's doing very good at it and so I work for a local government\nAnd that time is to leave that retirement benefits should security\nYou would believe it was her the mechanics thing\nTo sell women's clothing [noise] ...\n... are you already involved in the business\nYes she's been selling it for a year and a half um cheese cheese killing it she she makes in one week would I make and gross and among as a mechanic mhm\nSo I Would be going fulltime helping her with English ing and shipping in the back office stuff while she sells all the dresses and scourge\n... and ... and and what do you make a make fifty two thousand a year\nYou can hire somebody cheaper and fifty two thousand dollars a year to work in the back all for shipping stuff would that be the the best route to go is less pretend OK you walk away from fifty in order to ruin job you could have hired somebody for twenty to do\nThat come ... short\nWell she she grows says she's gross two hundred ten thousand so far this year\nI don't care what she groceries okay unless you're going to add\nMore to her business in savings okay or in revenue than what you are making now then it's not making sense\nOkay 'cause grossing two hundred and ten is fine as long as your expenses aren't three hundred and then you know yeah she's got costs of goods sold out of that that's not profit we're talking about there yeah ... is is around a hundred thousand out of that she's going to have taxable income of a hundred K. and she needs somebody to do are shipping\nShe needs a lot of help she's ... we're working two full time jobs they were working from eight AM to an eleven twelve sometimes\nMhm okay\nSo the question then becomes what are you going to add\nNot can you quit okay so it's just a business perspective because the other thing that scares me here is if if this thing or\nOut on you then you're both out of work if you quit yes if it flamed out on you if the fad passes on this particular clothing line five years from today is is things do operate in this multi level deal right\nAh well I guess you'd call multi level\nMarketing and I would call me oh it's on network marketing thing your recruiting people\nKnow that's that's the misnomer a that's a misconception of ... by wholesale\nShow retail just like a discount tire store buys Michelin inter Cooper Tires I don't like All right you don't recruit people\nValue can but yeah you can also\nNo I I Would hire somebody to do the shipping\nAnd then when it gets so big and you're making so much money\nYour by you win the money and you weren't ... then that's fine\nLet me tell you a story about two families litter very much alike and a lot of ways both families of two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting

Ramsey show\nCash his king and paid off mortgage has taken the place of the medium double you as the status symbol of choice on Dave Ramsey your host to jump in and we'll talk about your life your money it is a free call AAA eight to\nFive five two to five Brandon starch this hour in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Brandon how are you\nBetter than I deserve but a little confused\nOh how can I\nWell my wife and I were debt free except for our house uh-huh and we've got a one and a half year old little boy yea and we want we want to plan approved college but before he goes to college is most likely for are going to sort of a two year mission right and I know that probably doesn't\nWe've got a chunk of money right now about seven thousand dollars that were willing to put somewhere but we're trying to decide whether we should put it down on a mortgage which one way or the other will be paid off before he goes yeah by a couple of\nGood ah or should that be something [noise] um who could build up that the future mission in college fund\nGotcha okay and your debt free except your home\nIn addition to the seven thousand dollars do you have an emergency fund a rainy day fund of three to six months of expenses\nWe'd do you how much is in that\nAbout\nGood okay well you're out what we call baby step for five and six baby step ones with thousands saved too is that free but tiles\nThree is a fully funded emergency fund\nBaby step for is putting Fifteen Percent of your household income into retirement which you should just start doing that as a part of your savings you're investing plan right now maybe step five is kids college and beyond that six is pay extra on the house as you can\nAs fast as you can so what I Would do with this on it is I Would ever market for school and mission trip\n'cause you guys are obviously LDS right we are you OK\nCool so what what I'm going to do is say out of the seven thousand I'm probably going to drop five thousand of it into a five twenty nine for my one and a half year old\nInto a good grow stock mutual fund that's all for college has to be used for college take the other two thousand and just settled in a mutual fund and your name\nNo big deal just regular mutual fund and your name and you just on the file when you drop the paperwork into a file right mission trip on the file\nBut it's just earmarked for that it's in your name your controlling the money\nAnd if everything goes as planned and he's going to do is to your mission trip and ... then that two thousand will grow into enough to help him do that the other five thousand you'll add to it periodically throughout his life so that there's enough in there for him to go to college when he comes back from mission trip\nPaycheck to paycheck\nAnd um it's not a hundred percent completed yet we had to borrow money on it uh to kinda get things rolling a little bit but um we got an offer to do a care taking position and the guy a the\nA four hundred dollars a month to take care of his vacation home I'm In the same town we live um [noise] do we sell our home or do we keep it and continue making painted on it\nIt's not completed\nWell it where the point it means a paint and flooring and you're living in it no no um well we were living in a mobile home\nUm but then we got that offered to live in this house basically for free and he pays a live here and take care of\nI got the car okay so that's so you've never lived in this other house no okay she'll be able to sell it and the condition that Sam yeah lucky they can't get financing on it right so you're going to take a whipping a\n... want to take money wise to finish it\nUm\nWell I've never had a professional answer on that but probably about eight thousand ten thousand dollar yeah and what is your household income um well my husband he worked forty hours a week or ... household income\n[laughter]\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year okay so your husband is the only one working well we have a business um that doesn't mean that I N running it don't make money\nHis income is about twenty seven thousand in the business makes about Fifteen thousand nearly\nOkay [noise] and then [noise]\nDoing the care taking 'cause in order to be made in about forty eight hundred cash but we get housing for free\nYeah I got up or until you get into if he decides he doesn't want you to care take anymore and then you don't have housing for free anymore and that's all right so I mean you walk into more on fire you\nPretty much a change my mind and then you you have a housing issue again right so um you have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring as it is\nUm [noise] well we had a appraisal and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand it's mark completed so probably a hundred and fifty hundred and forty five\nWell no not if it's not completed it won't know um because ... it's a further discounts on the cost it takes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer cannot bothers out okay because they don't have any money and they're trying to get\nAnd so that limits your in but they didn't limit your selling pool to investors and they're going to discount that a lot deeper than that if you get a hundred out of there should be flying I'm thinking so um [noise] how much will be borrowed against it so far\nUh [noise] about how the south we owe thirty thousand but there are some property attached to it all together in a hundred thousand\nYou owe a hundred thousand and against the house and the property which would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if you sold the property is well\nYes okay All right\nYeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars in an additional loan and get this house finished and let's get it so as soon as possible\nAnd under\n... and ... yeah\nYeah we all have you know you should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm\nNot a ton which are going to get a little money out of it so\nYou know it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that Ryan yeah\nYou've got way too many hours in this house and and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here right you'll get a little bit but it's not it is it's not worked out very good so you know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you guys need look at your incomes\nBecause your household income as you I'm very very low income and ah so I I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime but\nYeah I Would get that house finished up I'm saving scratching glowing painting and\nYou know if you borrow three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's let's try and get his sold as fast as possible now if the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land without selling the house in order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first\nCelebrate so an acre also corner use that money to finish the house then get the household and that way there's no more debt involved Olivia is one of those in Lexington high Olivia how're you\nDoing how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise] and I had a question and I had a significant amount of debt and I'm going to pay that off like [noise]\nI'm about an op ed in recovery for an addiction and an idea that it's going to therapy so [noise] and I think I'm planning she could budget and [noise]\nAnd I pet therapy at the end it spreads like we're not going to get paid and sound kinda\nAdequate that I'm not really sure way to put it in the budget or how big of a priority to make it how long have you been clean I'm Glad they're\nGood for you well known what is it\n[noise] um actually addiction and an eating disorder [noise]\nOkay All right well no I'm not going to put therapy\nOn hold right now this is something you need you need some accounts were to walk with you is your finish this life transformation and that that is essential to you having a life would you agree with that statement yeah now\nWhat I Would do is is number one it's not a permanent situation\nUm the therapies not permanent is not going to be there the rest of your life fifty years from now you're not gonna still be going to the therapist okay I Hope I'm and then uh otherwise therapist is not very good [laughter] but ah at some point you'll you'll pull back from that\nAnd the second thing will happen is is that as you continue to address your income injure outgo\nFeeling you're going to feel more energized to make more income and so if this month you don't pay any extra ... ... there'll be good\nIf next month the same thing happens okay\nBut by this time next year we ought to be making more money right let's do something most kick her life in gear and let's start to clean up the mess to look for today Seventy five whole days you been clean\n[laughter] that's a great start right but it's not like you told me you've been clean for two years\nBy the time you're going for two years we ought to be different having a different conversation about the money would that make sense to you [noise] so let's get you handled and then let's see oh your money\nAnd as you go and it's not going to be suddenly like a switch flips undergo OK I'm OK not getting the money no smog all or nothing it's coming gradual it'll be incremental you'll feel better you you know when you're\nNinety Days or years four months you ought to feel different than you feel right now and you ought to be able to do more than make Moran is save more and more and you know you're you'll have more focus on the money 'cause you'll be more handled and\nHave to spend less severe emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting through this is that right [laughter]\nOkay I Want you to finish turning the corner you turn the corner what you're finished turned the corner and let's let's gone out and then\nAs you make incremental progress move\nMoney from your new in common you're increased income\nThe ... foot for today we want to take care of Olivia you need to be taken care of and you're doing a good job yourself out of this or whatever and the\nShow\n\n\n\nHow often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money ... how often or you're stressed about bills and afraid your paycheck will last the whole month you shouldn't have to live like that you should feel powerless over your money and you don't have to you can take control of your money\nWas the financial ... University of membership you learn to manage your daily finances pay off debts spin and save wisely and invest for your future if you follow this course\nAnd do to stop we teach it works every single time in fact the average person pays off fifty three hundred dollars in debt and saved twenty seven hundred dollars in the first Ninety Days but this is so much more than a ...\nAnd we're just getting to the part where we're ah we're working on wheels and so because we have this special needs a issue we we involved or attorney and getting our wheels together good and during that conversation we uh um\nUh we've been discussing a special needs ... world I'd have to play in planning for our baby's future yeah your animal\nOr a originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of function the same way that the other boys have a college fund and babies got five [noise]\nUm the uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special condition who special rules because of the of course\nAh you know his his speeches are boring it's too early to know what is it ... fully what his needs are we've been blessed that he's\nHe's healthy developing well you know there's this guy to limit for him just like anyone [laughter] um and we don't have to ah [noise]\nAh you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations [laughter]\nBut uh but now as far as I'm getting into it and we haven't find anything quite yet but it's coming down to the wire one of the things that I'm uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investigating money or find the truth I I lose control of that to the track the that we've named didn't while while I trust the ... the inability to go with their wishes that makes me uncomfortable\nYou know you don't you don't need a special needs trust unless both of your die right the\nSpecial needs trust does not need to be funded proud of your death okay so that it it sounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay\nIt's not ... I wouldn't even have it formed accept upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as he was alive as long as one of us alive to manage your ass that's one of the things you're going to do is care for this child\nWho out of those assets now that the when the trust is needed is if both of you die it gives the trustee ... the the the the direction on how to handle the assets and disperse them to take care of this child's needs\nAnd um and what that needs to be is a a a big hairy term life insurance policy that ... that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs trust or a portion of the policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of the policy in the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust\nIn the event that by both of you die kind of of things were the primary beneficiary is your wife okay but then past that the secondary beneficiary is some portion would go while you've got minor children into a family trust to take care of the minor children your oldest two until they get them through college the other\nPetra lay care for this other child throughout life not\nJust through college and so it's a larger amount needed to do that and then what happens is let's say we fast forward Twenty years\nAnd this child is Twenty years old and you've got a million and a half dollars and mutual funds okay when your other children are grown and gone\nOr close Twenty years from now right dreamed a dream that law yeah we're kicking them out so they're going [laughter] that's the legacy by [laughter] but it's out of that than\nWhat we've got is we've got some portion of my million and a half dollars in my example is going to be part in the special needs trust in the event both you and your wife or to pass the rest of it would go to your ... more traditional airs directly\nHer but you know we put a million dollars in a ... and the the youngest child ... special needs trust at Twenty years old because he's going to need care and that's a thousand dollars a year it'll produce that'll take care of him and may be one of his brothers is the trustee\nBy them you know would you would you go ahead like we're doing right now would you form the trust of the legal ... now and we put unfunded or would not let it they could make it a clause in in the well why not why would I Would just\nMake it a clause in the will to be formed upon both of your ... okay because you don't need it now you don't need to be filing tax returns for the next twenty five years on this thing\nYou don't need is or is that all the time you don't need to go to all the legal expense to form the trust so let me give you another example okay special needs as a as a special conditional\nVersion of just taking care of minor children right then the differences that might be perpetual okay but you know my children grew up\nSo my need for a trust to cover my minor children\nIn a in a live in both of our best expires at\nThat the need for that expired and\nI Would have done it for nothing in this case is only ... you're going to need a ...\nBut I wouldn't be doing it until you die mess with\nDo whatever you want that's that's how we view thankful to God\n\n\nI

break\nAbout the difference between on the national level the Democrats and Republicans and what does amaze me as Trump wins this election sixteen and the and the Democrats don't learn from it at all they are drifting farther and farther left\nNominating socialist\nTo run on the platform in nova and run for the general election in November ... some amazing to me that they and and overplay their hand with Kavanaugh and now yeah silently supporting this caravan this coming up here and you know it's\nLike we played that clip from Harry Reid earlier where he was he was in Nineteen Ninety three saying no sane country would allow birthright citizenship or John jobs are gifts longtime political activists or I've been to different people so far the ticks me to tell you hello I'll do that during the break 'em that but uh you got a lot of friends out there John power lines with the enemy to step of your question Jay\nNo I just ... what are your thoughts on him I ride them\nI Know you're right and I just did a little article and spoke to hit today are on the platform comparisons and I talk about the Democrats are not in that context although they do embrace socialism\nIn the primaries it seems like the Democrats a campaign as far as they can do the laugh the Republicans' campaign as far as I can do the right and of course in the general election they typically try to do the center left or center right kind of a composition but the Democrat Party at the national level has\nNo real platform no nothing definitive like him but it's just total up obstruction it's anti Trump up every day our job today is how can we trip the prized enough and you know this I'm\nLike you say the caravan thing the ... they used to be against illegal immigration but now that the the the growth of their party depends on\nUm restoring ... voting rights sure of that ... their growth of their party depends on trying to get him mates to vote in prison you know making it where they can vote in prison in some areas I think they can\nAnd also getting illegal immigrants across the line not even us citizens getting them on entitlements getting them registered to vote and voting is just the most absurd thing up saying in terms of a strategy\nFor growth and well ... ... and people are turned off by the platform I mean the ... the Democrat even at the state level because Walt Maddox was out there today saying or I saw the article today I guess you'd say the last couple of days\nWe need early voting in Alabama well yeah I mean if you're a Democrat of course you need early voting because early voting was instituted by Democrats because there are people historically don't go to the polls on election day\nAnd the only way they can be competitive in a lot of these states is early voting and that's it and and and historically Democrats have outperformed Republicans in early voting\nOr so of course a liberal like Walt Maddox would want to come in and Institute early voting in Alabama [noise] um but it's not just that this whole fight for Fifteen Fifteen dollar minimum wage which is just job killing everywhere it's ever happened is just destroyed low income jobs it hurts minorities in the working class the most\nUm it hurts the young ... the most and so why would you make that your position in Alabama well they well Democrats ... which is different than no you're not you're actually like the national\nAs you note typically and historically the Democrats have really a gone after the labor unions and that's a good self with alarming because if you could raise the minimum wage is going to help them raise the right wages or their rank and file\nThe problem with that strategy is now the rank and file likes this president has cut and regular licenses doing job creation who's\nHelping the economy and not hurting the economy and I think a lot of the rank and file and labor unions\nAre are going to believe I think we'll get most of the labor union support and twenty

the world war two documentary\nAnd I think Trump went there with the messages that I'm gonna bring jobs back and we'll bring jobs back I just don't understand why local Democrats are local Republicans are pointing to their democratic counterparts and saying this guy's just a national liberal Democrat like all the rest of you know\nJames on time told me he says you can trust the people but you got

think that people have four or five dead they're crazy and radical Elmo they'll kill him with a bomb that were too many children do is just crazy thoughts out there and I don't know how the people come up a but it's made in the late in the mainstream America\nDo you use it as soon as being a little while ago talking about the mental health of the people and and this is how I kind of look at it

they were talking about having the states do it in\nAnd go in and go wherever to sell insurance across state lines and things like that\nAnd then nothing happened they they don't even talk about it they they never even attempted they try to basically get rid of the Obamacare than the famous John McCain boat but they lost demand because Obamacare was terrible and they actually but\nSince they're so therefore that's where I have\nAnd it it's crazy is absolutely crazy the or the Republicans just dropped the ball on that and I don't know why they did it I don't I don't get it at all that was that was such an important issue that it actually in the state of Alabama\nThey were that was a main driving issue that they were using push state jobs are out there and people talking about we talked about on this show an awful lot\nBut they they seem to just kind of have dropped it and the Democrats are certainly seen as being someone who is more health care oriented and you get into this Medicaid for all of this kind of show up but uh or expansion of Medicaid\nBut they really do say this year and when we look back at the forensics of some of these races\nThat may be something that we're going to go back and say well the reason that that particular person did not win was because there was not a health care which it in their campaign that they were talking about\nSo let me let me keep going here with a Nancy quarters and talking about Florida and look at the health care and important other issues\nThat clinic is located in Florida is twenty six district represented by

I wouldn't have been better\nIf you were feeling placing comics or what would have happened to\nHear your district to them I\nWould be part of a health services are\nPresident Trump is campaigning for Republicans here in Florida Today he's been trying to change the conversation to immigration an issue where Republicans the gal that said happy at\nFour o'clock central and we'll all be here or prime time election night special really looking forward to this starting at nine eight central right here\nI Am going to have fun watching the election I we're tourists but as somebody who's about to go with Medicare\nIs that you know you look at the longevity Medicare and you could have a problem within seven years in Medicare if they don't do something in here\nAnd the Democrats are quick to say well they're going to cut Medicare well what they're trying to say Medicare and use it because I Am doing this research on how to you know buy supplements which supplements to buy a ruining kinda tutored myself in this whole thing\nBy the way everybody else who's to say get\nA section of and um\nWhen you really look at it you don't study kind of the information actually section gee for the money differential is better you just have a hundred and eighty three dollar out of pocket expense and once you've made that that everything's\nPaid for in your premiums are cheaper there but that does kind of disturbed me being a cancer survivor and then be independent about Medicare and only have an outlet to Medicare 'cause there's none of the other choices but\nThe what what is happening is listed they cover Medicare the more you're supplement goes up\nAnd so that's why F is going to do is we're going to start going higher and actually going to do away with that because the last year you can get it if I read it correctly but these are you know when you started messing with somebody's health insurance particularly\nVery jarring I'm Out there and particularly being a cancer survivor\nSo the Republicans need to get that get ahead of this issue in the show talking about it and again I think it was one of those things that when we go back and look we may find some way is that where the person was in a Republican district because of the lack of a coherent\nA healthcare story that they did they could tell or at least say that they were doing something with it\nBut immigration is she picked up with that is what is in Florida you got to bury you have an aging population and you have a high Medicaid population so you have to insert suspect you may have Medicare recipients a whole bunch of them that are there and then you have a paper that her own\nMedicaid and their equivalent of our uh health insurance for kids like ... which one of the way that is one of the best\nPrograms in the country is what we do here in Alabama people criticize about a lot of those kids first is not one of them they do a great job with it to seven to nine two to eight I'm let's get bored taper down into the uh the midterm uh analysis here and\nThis was an analysis that was on Fox I thought was interesting\nOne way to the mid term elections in an see below sea sounds confident\nThat they're going to wind\nUp until today I went to shed the election were held today we went down saying is well even when\n\nYou want to say that on on Hillary's fireworks bars when\nWe on the ground like why should I get excited maybe she's got secret polls that we're not we don't have access to\nA guy who remember the exact same people who two years ago said Hillary Clinton was going to be president or the people were saying the Democrats are gonna win out today so please take this with a grain of salt they talked about cold I think we know how these work by now are they ask a certain number of people who they're going to vote for\nBut then they filter that down based off of likely voters so who they think\nWill vote but they're just guessing I read an article this morning in the air softer about why millennials aren't voting and one of the number one reason why millennials don't vote it's\nBecause they don't know where to buy stamps Brian spend our to buy stamps white male and they don't want to mail in ballot so I have a hard time hearing this argument that Democrat enthusiasm high when buying a stamp is heard all that's too high to collide\nThat actually it was an article that talked about the war\nAnd ... you know or the post office and that would be kind of ... percent right but then where's that those who Google [laughter]\nThere's only one of them are show will be back after this brief break [noise]\nYou're listening to the ... show\nOn the news talk Ninety three point one W.

Congress and through trying to get to work to do something like what he's talking about the reason that the ... I got this off of\nSome power wash them off the last ... dire the anchor baby is being planned it for someone to make a long term plan to arrive in the United states legally\nAh when I was Twenty one years old ... ... what are her when they're Twenty one like in starts on street people come in to the United states legal but not correct that is good that is correct so it it yeah it you've got the the you know I should do it\nThan that I or baby is is your ticket to get into the United states at a time down the road or in that state and they stopped that needs to be done and it just it just doesn't work\nWell and not not to mention all the benefits that you hear about being a U.S citizen I mean think about it you you know you're going to get free health care if you um you know if you're on Medicaid for example\nAnd you were you can't if you're you're not supposed to if you're um an illegal alien here because we know what happens there or you know so\nYou know as soon as the benefits of things like food stamps section eight how saying things like that\nAbsolutely I mean it's something that will take it all in one on another subject and I'd like I'd like to help me campaign and all this they asked they said copper trot out about two divisions east and west division\nOne of the\nTeams in the east division is ... and you know they're not in a state or a mosque gas you were made to the south Asian accomplished like off sixty five that the body and you could take over\nYou're in the west the only question is banned the bill and it's about ten miles west of interstate sixty five and you can put them in Asia and that would bounce mountain everybody would actually pretty Big East or west and that will open up the possibility for\nYou know if the ... things happen there's an Auburn, Alabama ...\nSomehow ended up at a championship game\nOf the national championship would that be knocks it would be nice to me it makes it a whole lot of students but it it goes I don't think about all started not been called on the map and I looked out there well this this crazy or say sixty five is almost exactly I'm hanging up ... school\nOne spot do the other it just does not make it a little dirty the white and plus to get above you got the article wherever you anyway we'll just go to Bob but not all the other out but\nIt would ah it sure gave us a little bit more\nUh I don't want to use control but it would give us a little bit more hope or having both of Alabama the national championship later oh\nHere just stop somebody might not like that particular option\nWell you know there's only two states docket like all that good ... on up would be a tendency because a band built and they've been going up you know better than the starting a complex lipid measure\nAnd Mississippi with Mississippi and old miss a Mississippi State no missed been starting to Beijing mhm but I just thought maybe they could\nFigure out side they were to be more to do it that way\nBut they had to give me your mental neighbors or your to input okay September ... you got to worry about your own appreciate you just don't enjoy doing one they're more show will be back when it for that [noise]\nYou're not going to that's not going to ... you know it it doesn't matter because Feinstein is on the ticket and she's going to win is a Democrat states but Missouri is going to be a whole different story and then how excited today in Indiana that pushes they're doing in Indiana towards the clothes out\nI think that's going to be the thing that's going to cook Donnelly and the fact that he keeps saying to work over forty three percent and income but now you ban we get it over forty three percent and there is a libertarian this on the ballot an independent libertarian ... which doesn't she showing six percent of the boat\nBut I think when it's all said and done and you can add up to vote the issue probably be more like at the three or four percent I don't think she'll clear the six percent number [noise] so now he's gonna be talking about polls and uh taking the Senate\nIn terms of momentum and trends where they had also we saw function we saw something over the course of September with the Kavanaugh hearings and even into early October or that there was some momentum on the Republican side\nThat's probably one of the Democrats ability to flip some of these a deep breath districts are the same time we think we've seen it level law not whether it's turn the other way and gone against Republicans\nWe don't know yet ah I'd say we're still kind of flat lining where Republicans have improved their chances are but but not dramatically it out or the Senate seems secure\nSenate looks much better than it did a month and a half ago Republicans are probably in a position to hold steady or even pick up a couple seats Shawn this does X factor of people just are not wanting to tell people that are supporting President Trump\nOr the Republican Party because of the some of the backlash we've seen you know that's something we didn't say to some extent and twenty sixteen obviously the polls are a little bit of a pro democratic clean that year\nThat could happen this year a pollsters are are trying to fix that what they're they're waiting and math that I won't bore your uh watches to tears with we're hoping that they figured it out\nIt um\nI don't think they have figured it out but I'm looking at ah some of these polls have come out and they gave you the tabs up but it's a technical term\nOf what percentage they ah they have that Republican or Democrat independent and I think it has to be done by state there's no doubt about that but I think they're basically wrong from looking at past history of some of these I think that's going to be the thing that's why\nThey missed a profile of Florida in the twenty sixth St Louis and they fixed it I don't think they've ah Florida's been of all the time and they they basically don't calculate the pan\nHandle the way it should be and they get way too much weight to Democrats and they think Democrats are ruining the roost in there just aren't\nSo is now getting into some of the issues and this is interested in the negative tone and the media and I think this will be a\nIn the election the president in his unleashing a torrent of exaggerations Kenny Republicans are adopting Trump signature combative style\nAbad nine days for the Republicans to have the president and this kind of a pickle\nFull a new study by the media Research Center looking at the network news casts from September first through October twenty six found that mid term coverage of the Republicans has been eighty eight percent negative compared to just fifty three percent negative coverage for the Democrats here\nTo weigh in on that day that ... is senior editor at the federal left an author I have a new book called first freedom what's the reason for that eighty eight percent negative\nI think it's a reflection of the Trump era and uh the media's ability and ... active way of becoming a part of the Democratic party ...\nMore than I Know about some of my own family members so um that kind of glowing coverage is just now they they feel more open and able to do it because of their reaction to Donald Trump bright behaving you say that oftentimes skewed coverage has essentially the opposite effect\nI think so I think most voters now view the media through the prism of a of a part of them because they realize that most of the mainstream media is is just an activist wing of the Democratic party so ah they react negatively towards that sort of coverage rather than positively I think that happens quite often\nAnyways certainly enough there was a poll that just came out that sixty four percent of the public feel that the media is biased towards the Democrats that's an amazing number\nThen when you take out of the Democratic side of that and you ask Republicans do you think that the media is biased it's up in the eighty ... eighty percent right\nI mean those absolute incredible but the problem is when you say media and do you mean oh made you do you mean certain types of media\nAnd when I look at it a question like that as being as\nBecause if you say if you look at the media is Fox then you don't think that President if you look at the media is ABC NBC and CBS you do so in the polling anything that could have asked the question a lot better but issues and responsibilities in reporting by the media again what\nDo you think as far as one of the biggest concern for Democrats and Republicans we've heard healthcare for Democrats immigration for Republicans\nBy I think immigration is a bigger deal than than Republicans and Democrats realize so when you're talking about the caravan are just talking about the fourteenth amendment\nOr Democrats seem very sure of the mainstream media seems very sure that that's something that's going to work in their favor but I'm I'm not sure that people are as open about that in polling as they really feel I think that that's an issue they should be worried about an\nObviously healthcare is an issue for Democrats but I think the overall and biggest issue for them is always Donald Trump yeah ah so according to Marcy I'm looking at the big screen once again Democrats coverage is thirty five percent more positive than Republicans and Republicans coverage is thirty five percent more negative\nIs why is that why is the coverage in more than ... you know because they feel comfortable campaigning for people like fate or I mean they talk about for instance voter suppression or things of that nature which are negatively reflect Republicans wearing that doesn't even exist at all\nWhether they do it's a it's very very skewed to seven to nine to two a\nReminder about first time ... job with the British to know we're going to name him for the joined put the pressure market give ... give ... marketing than any color

always cover involvement in the\nList goes to say about Jonathan Turley here I'm Talking about the fourteenth amendment\nThere has been a long standing debate so yeah you can have a good faith argument on both sides and still be a good person not a dog whistle arguments for anything else because people now are not using it to the original tension in many cases they're using it as a strategy to become citizens common here\nHave a kid make that kid in American citizen just for that reason that's not the reason this this uh this amendment was written yeah I don't understand\nAll the hyperbole and anger about this this has been a long\nStanding debate there's good faith arguments on both sides the natural reading of this amendment which seemed to support unlimited birthright citizenship but the history\nThe tax some of the draft ers tend to go the other way and courts view clauses like this is having meaning they don't trust is dispensed them so the question is why was this clause put in what was it referencing\nAnd you couldn't make certainly make a good faith argument that it limits\nBirth rates birthright citizenship the United states is something of an outlier there's only about thirty countries have recognized unlimited birthright citizenship fry or that doesn't mean that you can use an executive order you know I testified against President Obama using executive orders and I think it was wrong that I think it's wrong now\nBut I think Lindsey Graham's proposals legislation or could have a stronger case to make in court poet labels Jonathan Turley thanks so much\nAnd we were saying yesterday and we broke the story about Lindsey Graham the out there and people just and it's funny how\nLindsey Graham is so loved on CBS and this kind of stuff when he was being critical of 'em don't show up I've used it we're not saying Lindsey Graham on NBC\nAnd he used to do MSNBC stuff too but you know where to be found nowhere to be found now he did do I make the press segment a while back but that's you know we just wanted after a that a McCain had passed away [noise]\nSo let me pick up pick back up with a couple of other things one lives to this story quick story about China into office who are charged with stealing us aviation technology\nAnd the foreign third time since September of Chinese intelligence officers are accused of stealing information from the American corporation\nPen Chinese intelligence officer crackers and company insiders face espionage charges on that night until yesterday kids of conspiring to steal commercial jet engine technology for more than a dozen company kept the game is in Washington let the details of this important investigation this\nLatest indictment it adds to the growing tension between the U.S in China in the middle of this fear straight or federal prosecutors say the Chinese officers tried to steal coveted information on turbo saying engine technology and while they were working to develop a similar engine for their commercial plane that was Thirteen companies\nAs targets of the operation with office is located in France the United kingdom at age ... here in the U.S hackers allegedly several tactics including\nInjecting malware and in the company's computer systems in a statement a U.S attorney accused China of trying to steal the information for commercial gain saying that China I Would use the information to build their own engines instead of buying American\nOkay so instead of buying an American you steal it and then you just replicated and then you've got an F thirty five\nAnd this is what the Trump has been talking about this forever is talking about the Chinese are not on his folks to stealing stuff they um they take advantage of being in he won't something to be so he wants to to get center of that\nSo I'm Glad that they do these guys and I hope that the Trump is able to make a really good point with that I notice that they didn't include anything about Trump and things that Trump it said in the past about this subject\n[noise] so what's a some kind of move into a another area here and that is um let me go back to a Trump plans to sign the order and the birth a birthright citizenship\n\n[noise] the president plans to sign an executive order that were removed the right to citizenship for babies of non citizens and an authorized immigrants born on us soil and this was broken into about thirty minutes ago it is in a conversation with X CEOs on HBO\nAnd we're the only country in the world\nA person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us is ridiculous and it has to end some have you talked about ... council\nWhere in the process in the process that will happen\nIn order to John ... are actually goes on and the president of the United states joining us right now\nAre Cubans to really are Bloomberg cheap Washington correspondent Kevin you and I are now Noah Feldman are wonderful professor of law a Bloomberg opinion but it takes us back to drugs God of Eighteen fifty southern the battle over slavery those of us that saw the movie Daniel Day Lewis with Lincoln and all that saw that\nDuring his visit to Pittsburgh Tuesday Afternoon\nMany of them were demanding that the president could damn white nationalism and tone down divisive rhetoric [noise]\nOne man was arrested after refusing to move into barricaded street\nOutside the synagogue Mr Trump but the first lady laid roses and ceremonial stones to honor each of the victims or they were joined by a bunker Trump's son in law Jared Kushner for both of whom are observant Jew\nSo they're going to emphasize the or the demonstrators there but I I like the fact that they added in the family members that are Jewish and their nose at night who could touch I was kind of surprised that they did that just go to the second part of this\nPresident and visited the University of Pittsburgh Medical center Presbyterian to meet with for law enforcement officers injured and Saturday shootout\nShe expresses thanks for their service SRO over their injuries and really wanted to hear some of their stories about the events\n\nBefore the president arrived mortar said goodbye to for the victims including below brothers Cecil and David Rosenthal and Daniel Stein the Seventy one year old had just become a grandfather\nDr Jerry Rabinowitz was also buried his family says the sixty six year old ran toward the gunfire to help others roots that learn new it for almost forty years\nIt he would be the kind of person who would [noise]\nWould do whatever he could to help in a situation like\nWonderful person here at the synagogue yesterday the president was asked if he had anything to save and he said quote sad sad\nI Hope we've learned a lot\nOf all the posters being held up around here there was one that I Love and I know you'll love it said quote hate cannot weaken\nThat was a good line taken a week in a city has to do that was a very good one [noise]\nTrey Gowdy was was ... bones so we can say we've got somebody wants to stay within the subject matter here\nBy the way\nThey do because most quickly market guys I'm heading down there right after the show say how things are going to\nGo ahead please try again and\nStart with what were we left off with with with Jonathan Swan who covers the White House and talking about that that sort of battle that goes on and the ... the fingers that are pointed over what happened at the synagogue this weekend\nUm but he felt that the responsibility lies more on the president than it does on the press because he is quote the most powerful person in the world to agree with that [noise]\nAll I certainly agree is most powerful person in the world he has a unique opportunity um I have never been good moral changing people's behavior um I I I Need to be good at engaging in self reflection\nAnd if every one of my fellow citizens or look in the mirror and say what can I Do to improve our country how can I be less of this is how can I be more intentional in my efforts to unify this country I Can't change President Trump's behavior I Can't change the headlines of political or the Washington Post\nI what I Would love to see the president to when it goes to Pittsburgh\nIs to is to use the jars the lives of those last that towards unified are just like in Charleston woman when the item on fellow south Carolinians lost their lives simply the calls are black\nGet to know the people who lost their lives that would be a unifying for my fellow citizens but but look politicizing tragedies hours after they happen of it is just one of how incredibly the visible we are\nGoing to do anything that is exactly right if they would you do you use it as the the victims in this where you get to know who they are\nThere's what they did and toasted you remember we found out about the lady who was the stronger and the pasture and because of the story behind it and all of that is what really makes you it is not\nThat they used to live and work who is who the level where there were two and I you know Trey Trey Gowdy really knows how to hit it right and the squeeze of things to stay with him and he's going to be turned to an just talking about understanding each other his was good\nIt has a picture of each treated 'em what sort of like your dream of how you wish things could be ... explain what you meant here\nWell bill novels or in a picture was us attorney under President Obama a space to the left of Chairman Mao politically uh we've been friends for ten years old friends until we die Tulsi Gabbard is one of the kindest nicest most decent people I've ever met\nShe happens to be a progressive from Hawaii or were you wouldn't put a progressive Hindu from Hawaii with a three part Calvinist Republican from South Carolina\nOn but we have been intentional and our desire to have a friendship and and\nI think part of what plagues our country now is we have a tendency to surround ourselves with people who just ratify what we already believe I mean if you want to understand how President Obama was elected twice you got to ask somebody who voted for it and the same with Donald Trump the media\nCannot fathom how his prize the United states ask someone who voted for it they will tell you why here's the president of the United states but of all you do is surround yourself with a philosophy department approached it they didn't know there are no Trump supporters there\nSo go as some people in rural America who felt ... and ... and\nAnd uncertainly that led to his election but of all we do is talk to people that just ratify what we already believe I'm making granted erections\nAnd let me go to a Charles Charles working with ...\nSorry damn right your stuff and they\nWere good Charles how 'bout you\nPretty good luck on the discussion about the

I mean everything is going in his direction but if you don't get the the the base out to vote if you don't get them mobilized and to the polls is not going to knock on account for much\nAnd um and that's what he's trying to do I think once the elections are over whatever the outcome of things are going to settle down on that political front he's going to sort of dial down I think the rhetoric a little bit and then all eyes are going to be focused again on this on this trade huge\nI Would even take it a step further and tell you this if the if the trade issue with China was already done and there were do we\nDo concerns do worries no fears you know we signed a deal or and everybody's happy and it's all about politics I Would suggest you are but the market right now would probably be at you know a ten ten percent higher than it's all time high\nThat's what I Believe I truly to because the date has just been too strong yarn exhibit phenomenal they've been great I mean look at the numbers today that came out with wages and salaries I mean they were up three point one percent I mean that's a huge number\nHuge number the consumer has a lot of spending power and that's another reason why GM went up so much today think of this what they said was we sold fewer cars and trucks\nBut we sold them for a lot more money per vehicle than we have in the past and the reason is because the consumer has a lot of of of purchasing power right now uh they have a willingness to to pay up there and so that I think more than anything\nIt doesn't just send a signal in terms of automobiles but it sends a signal across the spectrum in terms of discretionary income that the consumer has a bail to him or her to go out and spend money in this economy\nAnd ... and ... Mary's up nicely with ... with what else were saying and that is that consumers are healthier today than they've been in almost Fifteen Years\nI just saw the number of today in a in terms of the increase in wages best in in a decade they have that's that's good stuff that's very believable\nIt's it's just incredible and I asked I think and and the first thing I did that when I looked at the bond market you know I looked at the ten year bond you'll see what was going on there and sure enough that ten year bond you'll resent you hire but so was the market\nSo what does that tell you the market is beginning to adjust\nThe market's getting confirmation it's seeing numbers that are continuing to say\nYes this economy is growing yes interest rate should probably continue to go I touch hire a but the consumer is out there and they are healthy and they're still spending money and they're willing to absorb higher prices for those goods or services because they've got better\nSpent and that's what you want to see and and I think that's what putting a foreign market right here and that's also why say politics aside you take this trade deal with China off the table we are the efficiently higher than where we are right now\nSo it off and that's a quote around that if if if Trump is able to work at deal with China you let's say over the next few months or so and we've got the long run way of ... uh I think first stock prices and equity prices\nAre to make up any sort of lost ground that's happened in this month and and that's why I've been saying all throughout October when I call in\nThis is about the fear that this has nothing to do with something that has already happened or that there's some bogeyman out there that nobody is aware of this manic if that's not what this is about it's about I fear of a slow down\nBecause of a trade war that's going to get worse and because of the interest rates that are going to hire a and I think we want a long way in answering some of those questions that day and it yesterday so let's just you know less just relax and work through this\nAnd continue and continue to see these great numbers that come in and be thankful that we have a very healthy consumer out there uh and I think ah I think two thousand I think it'd be a great year\nEnd by the way that specific number I was looking for earlier wages and salaries jump by three point one percent highest level in a decade that was in the third quarter\nOne quarter that's pretty good growth uh it just think that you could accomplish color bred to three eight seven zero zero nine for ask them what you could do with three percent of your income if you set it aside and various ways and let time pass and get some very interesting answers on the whole world the bus abilities\nBut it ain't going to happen until your column and three and seven zero zero nine for scheduled employment come managerial about your money meet the incredible team of people that support brand at McDonalds Hagen and get yourself started on the road to financial wellness and a future that you are preparing for three eight seven zero zero nine four Brent thanks\nI appreciate it and a happy Halloween I Hope you have tons of trick or treaters\nWere going to the bottom hours so [laughter]\nThat sounds good buddies now I look forward to talking to mark daycare already\nIn this material or for general information only are not intended to provide specific advice or recommendations for any individual all performance referenced this historical when there's no guarantee your future results all into Caesar and managed to may not be invested into directly\nThe opinions expressed in this material do not necessarily reflect the views of L.

think that was just her hair if you noticed that when she put the tape measure it out and it goes down about twenty five feet\n... like just straight down you don't hear band or anything like that it's obvious there's some kind of supernatural element going on right there [noise]\nBut uh it's uh do you mean when I think about the whole thing coming up and attacking here I see it as representing

his shares I Love it thank you for saying scares going way is like\nI just I have to look at number one the quality of these two movies like as movies whether or not they're scary whatever I think it's just a better world the movie\n... I think is the way it shot but just what it is in first movie the permanent but cemeteries fascinating like wanting things that have died to come back and not accepting a\nBut it you know they when they come back they want to kill you write that mean bad things happen if you don't accept death and you learned after church but knew right right but I Hope it doesn't break your Halloween loving heart I Know what you're going to reopen its own I'm putting it over I Know you do this to me every week it's fine no [laughter]\nOh somebody's going to find a loser man I Am in school\nI think it's a very it's a tough situation it's too it's too great films and I'm a pet cemetery just it is a personal thing for me because it was like one of the first movie I ever saw well like everything I remember sneaking to watch the mini series of it so if you know\nIt has been put into the finals don't don't do know that brings us to the ... horror Nineteen Seventy nine\n... The Exorcist\nAlready know how can they go on this one okay well again so that was her first made me laugh okay fine why that is such a preference just lose All right this is your call it I think you're right how do you do miss aids\nOkay go ahead first one I'm going to choose The Exorcist that drink is I don't want to say it's a no brainer but it's um to me that's oh God\nHow horrible to their guns in over it or in a way yeah you're you're trapped she's trapped inside her own body she knows a little bit of what's going on or whatever but she possessed by the devil\nAnd it's got that so frightening um\nBut with ... horror that is\nYeah both of 'em are true story is based on true stories except for I Believe in The Exorcist it was a boy from the ... like will you please book or whatever but [noise] anyway um\nShe she cannot control being\nPossessed by the devil to the point I guess you could say but\nThat family could have left when things started getting hanky right Gillette says could've left um so that's how I feel about that I mean the exercise as much as just the better you know I I'm\nA Lutheran that you know learning about\nThat growing up I watched it when I was in sixth grade it scared the crap out of me my sister told me I was going to hell no [laughter] not yeah\nWhich just oh my goodness they're watching the exercise is my uncle James is watching it with me but he fell asleep before some of the really intense parts happened so there wasn't a whole cover your ears arise part and I'm sitting there and I'm watching it scared you the most things that I cannot say on the air\nOh so there's that and then\nElizabeth walks three on the phone she is like Thirteen or something we had a separate line put in for all her phone calls and uh she's walking through on the cordless phone is like for you please watches me uncle James Fell asleep [noise] she was like no\nI didn't want to go to hell and [laughter]\nAnd later that night I'm trying to get that

so how is she going to sneak her friends in\nOh we'll just make them in the ... after ... finally falling asleep after watching the flipping ... right so I wake up and like gasping for air because I just see these ...\nBlack shadows crawling like for me and whispers and stuff I don't know what's going on I'm trying to wake up I guess prayer Elizabeth clients are hand down on my mouth and she's like scream out but [laughter]\nUm I was like well\nIt was it was so funny that well\nYou're a loving\nThe Exorcist when your love it was if\nI have is what is now I was twelve she was Fifteen ... check I saw trials because that's what I'm Sorry you well you know we didn't have a based on The Exorcist shows themselves yeah The Exorcist or what say\nThe ... yeah we watched a them to build the other night and\nLike you I mean it's a it's a well done movie I liked the movie sure but\nThe Exorcist is just\nIt's it's like like she said goes back to the whole God and same thing in the
