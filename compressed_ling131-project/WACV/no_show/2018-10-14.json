Johnson drop the bomb shell\nThe first woman says those stupid elf in white people they're going to know how it feels they deserve this wait until later according to Johnson and report\nThe second woman who's the rambunctious one says yo like shooting fish in a barrel are you getting this baby I love you she said according to Johnson and the TSA the women were live streaming the occasion\nPolice had never followed up with the women described by the TSA employ now these were purportedly of Arab descent women not black women very important they were Arab women\nWhat is going on here what really happened in Las Vegas we still don't know but I tell you something I hate to say this but I'm Glad it happened and the reason I say it's ... I'm Glad it happened 'cause we're beginning this should show you what we're dealing with here\nThe stories change so many times they lied to just the media has both face lied to us\nShould that be setting off alarm bells in your head something's wrong here we're not getting the straight story no we're not getting straight story we're not going to get this straight story there's things they don't want us to know and this is one of them very important and why because your perception is reality is very important\nThat I ran across this article in and I've I've always believed this but I was glad to finally see it and that is your attention creates the future our attention is the most powerful instrument we possess that's what everybody wants it think about that\nThis is one of the matrix I hate that term the matrix does its best to distracted ring a bell over here over here very clever\nMaybe turn the matrix off and consciously choose what you would like to see or hear if you're not a sitting duck for their brain wash her while\nThey and you were undermining one of the world's or one of the most powerful tools you have the um distorted attention the ability to focus while they tell you that multitasking is a great skill on disagree\nAttention as I use it here centering demanding a specific direction and only that direction without any distractions practice focusing\nThat saying that is crazy they evacuated thirty three of them to Wright Patterson Ohio but they would not comment on the status of the remaining twenty two air force officials have not disclosed whereabouts the remaining twenty two other than to say a number of aircraft left at the base 'cause of maintenance for safety reasons and there's images here that show one of them in someone's backyard [laughter]\nSo that's not good a video of photos and video from the wreckage of the base showed the distinctive contours of twenty two square tail fans and angle vertical stable louder submitted a jumble of rubble and the basis largest building hangar fast you know\nAs I talk about on here so many times I Know for a fact they control the weather\nThey manipulate it they can steer it they can control it is it possible that our enemies well actually the people who are doing this are the enemies of America to be honest with you and did they steer this thing specifically for this to destroy some of our military stuff that makes you wonder\nYeah you gotta wonder like mind was that was what is that I'm twenty two and three point yeah three hundred thirty nine million times twenty two\nAs three point three billion times too that's six point seven billion ... billion dollars you know seven that'd be seven billion dollars in\nGone gone\nNow they have twenty twos were notoriously finicky and as New York time puts it not always flight worthy the air force reported earlier this year that just forty nine percent of the appointees were mission ready at any given time the lowest rate of any fight here in the air force\nI still love the Tomcat they're fourteen that's my favorite of all the modern planes and the Fifteen to of course I'm but I'm a World War two got paid thirty eight lightning spy fighter plane of all time [noise] uh runs circles around I must say no\nChance won't have for you because they're you liked the course they weren't in fact ... they were heady bought it from scratch bitter from scratch they were heavy they had tons of armor and it took a lot and not one out of Scott how are you coming in for you what the weird for you yeah well I'm a little bottles those two yeah\nThe the day that those are the carrier stack them when they fold the wings up yeah yeah that was that was the um\nAlmost had to kind of like a ... a that was the kind of like a ... yeah when they came out with a huge right with the Hubble ... yeah that way they could see all around them yeah they could just tear those uh ... uh\nYeah but the pay thirty eight was the highest scoring plane of the war [noise]\nLove it um I don't know whether it was looking in the ... to ... over a course there was a lemon one well I'm not talking about that until the number of total number of kills okay\nEight state just destroyed all those guns in the nose to the pilots they said the second they hit the the buttons to fire the the ... the zeroes just putting the just gone just rip them to shreds 'cause the Japanese didn't put in the armor and their planes\nWhich is crazy\nI'm a student of I'm a student of World War two I cannot help here like occurred under the especially the aircraft yeah me too I don't really know why just to [noise] um\n[noise] biggest bubble in history of mankind Ron Paul says us stock market will soon plunged by fifty percent\nNow Ron Paul's not just your average guy he's pretty sharp cat he really is\nNow the recent jumping treasury bond yields indicates that the U.S is barreling towards a potential recession and market meltdown at an increasingly fast pace\nAgain this is going to go back to taking of the physical money 'cause they want everything to be an electronic that way they can track every time you spend this is about control this is about total control folks\nAnd you know I was talking to Jason [laughter] always bring up Jason at bomb Howard's Wednesday night\nAnd he mentioned the him and his buddies were sitting around talking about something and when he picked his phone up and he went into a search engine what they had been talking about that's all the ads were about\nSo just for funds these they said okay well let's let's talk about maybe baby toys so they set the phone and started talking about baby toys when they pick the phone up guess what all the ads were about baby toys your phone's listening to you and it's script ing stuff to sell you stuff\nThat's crazy that's where we are right now and that's what the um don't have a cable TV you know\nThey have full K. right I don't know what's happening\nOh well um [noise]\nThese are these ... like a habit or um\nLike the early days right yeah I remember we went from this there's plasma now we're daily ... which somewhere to much Jews anyway these are\nI I've I've got a forgery you know and and my you've probably got one too\nI have no idea [laughter] I think I bought one of the last ... TV she could get well when I'm On it's been a while okay we're hitting bottom on them\nYou might not have won but anyway I'm I bought one aboard a um I think it was like five hundred on TV I got it for like two to South America while out of business so I went and bought it I don't blame me but anyway you have to connect to the Internet you know Ford worked like a shared a and and that's how that's how I can uh can pick up on that\nYeah Yup yup my I don't have my I Do not have my connected to the Internet now I have a couple of the ... the little DVR the DVD players that are Internet ready\nBut I don't have an looked up to the and I just don't I don't want my TV hooked on the Internet\n'cause I can only imagine they're going to know all my habits well I don't really watch that much t._v. other than that for one you know the the little short main woman watches TV I really don't watch that much t._v.\nIt's just nothing really worthwhile and [noise] I think I mentioned last week a TV show in the sixties called the invaders have you ever heard of that yes I Am I've got to complete set\n'cause a subscriber amount on YouTube said you you need to see these and it's creepy because it's the same pattern we're seeing now about\nHiding all the evidence and the so called authorities pretending they didn't see what they saw they don't know what they know it's it it all plays out to the script and that TV show with the sixties\nAnd uh it's wild never seen anything like it so unreal and it brings back really bad memories or when you when you know things and you try to tell people they don't they don't believe in it it's pretty wild\nBut anyway Rand Paul is is saying that uh yeah we're we're headed towards something really bad in the mainstream media is doing this to they're trying to tell us is going to be bigger than the great depression and what is going on I think it's all being done on purpose I really do\nAnyway do what you have to do just be ready for this stuff when it happens we to be honest with you we all really need to get up to speed on what our grandparents\nHow to do and that's kind of been at the last uh it's not a skill we have any more because we really don't have smartphones we can order stuff now we don't have to learn how to do this like our own butter you know Turner own butter or all this stuff milk the cow\nOr stuff like that I got to tell you it's it's going to be something we're having here singing I'm afraid we're headed towards bad stuff\nBecause that that whole lifestyle that were that we had been done we we were we were we were living you know since um since the United states was founded you know back in the day ... um is\nIt was uh have you done and we went on purpose you know so you can put you in a position you're in now so you have to depend on on the time comes\nIn and it's it's like ... instead of being the ones that are that they're tasks to protect us they seem to be the ones behind all this case in point I was reading this in a Jerry basically newsletter\nI get that believe it or not um\nThe people who make the granola bars one hundred percent organic granola bars\nThey ... they were tested and found to have I think forty nine ... in a glass of the now the EPA says they can have thirty P. P. M. a glass of ... which is beyond me gossip to known carcinogens why are they allowing it in our foods that's that's a question but\nSo what do you think happened to the maker of these one hundred percent natural or one hundred percent organic granola bars that had forty nine P. P. M. what do you think happened to them\nThe EPA said all they have to change that can't had they can't have a hundred percent organic on the label that was the only thing they do that's all they did they didn't find them they didn't say you can't have glass of ... no no no they just said you can't advertise it a hundred percent organic if your guy glass but and\nThat's our APA I've heard horror stories of people who are a guy was washing his tractor off with a pressure washer car pools up two guys in suits or what you doing I'm washing my tractor where's the runoff going well I don't know\nFinding\nI've heard of them are going after people who collect rainwater that's illegal it's crazy stuff and the EPA they carry side arms now why is it ...\nThis whole thing is out of control this government is out of control and it's got to be reined in at somewhere in time all of you know I'm going to get um [noise] yes it may have it already famous post offices all of them are good and you know if if your\nGod Forbid if you're a celebrity and you happen to speak out about any of this stuff you're that considering that job\nUm it it's unreal to me that Taylor Swift that's come out finally they tried to get her during the election to come out and say who she preferred she wouldn't but now the twenty eight year old who dropped out of high school or the G.

I think a general matter should have gone up I think he already has a team put together and as soon as the rats break at a Trump is going to get him to word and he's going to send the troops out\nAnd around out those characters and arrest them and take them somewhere I don't know ... mile or somewhere a whole bunch of college hotel you but I I I'll leave from Trump will lose [noise] a general matter or on the on on the on the on the right to it\nI Hope you're right a ... that's my opinion I pay those who all have\nA law that two things that I\nThink and believe in uh\nUh yeah so I don't know what's really going to have on but a\nA branch that much about that you know that I just I just I just believe it and I know a powerful uprising and like a general can be [laughter]\nI Know how powerful prayers or two\nAnd a lot of people praying for that uh-huh a actually\nA lot a lot of people a praying or social things are to happen yeah sure and uh so uh I don't\nAs you say are those who served as I can talk for hours and hours of that but [laughter]\nOh guess want one real quick to known on my a little machine or satellite shot here Yes sir [noise]\nThe main one that has the or most of them is how the ... the green and blue lights on on the one big one ... and a whole bunch of ... on it right and about a week ago is usually in the uh issues in the south east part of this guy\nKnow southwest father's casket ... weeks ago it shifted a hundred degrees who went away no off\nI ... my name is though there are more southern than eight or ... are are made you name it was a whatever your ... I Can't mention own the FCC regulated airway\nMy wife tells me [laughter]\nOn on a K fair enough so\nBut now I had a question post man how you doing tonight [noise] good how are you doing I'm doing well\nThis is go off topic but it's something that I've been thinking about for some reason today a in a in the account of the birth of Jesus\nWe hear about the mad yeah or the wise men from the eighth they came and all of the store\nAnd famously am and I know you're beginning to slash builds up and all that kind of stuff where do you think that the wise men came from and why were they even searching out the quote unquote must stop it's a good question\nWell [noise]\nReason why I think they were they were searching searching out the messiah\nBecause of the uh the prophecies you know from all the all the uh the proposition that came before him like a you know I was a a germ are I mean only ones that are that are ... you know he was John ... yeah yeah and um\nAnd most of the times\nI've sent his own program before um see as as Bob\nSo it's ... below okay the\nPath of the stars [noise]\nArrows a coming of kings here on earth and I'm gay\nAnd a lot of people don't understand that but this this is what this is what we supposed to know and and they tell us this uh this is a is an astrology and ... but it's not because uh I'm kind of God tells us in the or in genesis you know to uh to to to wants to pass a\nStars sun the moon and stars or for a A R for signs and uh and that's what the what the job was looking for\nAnd they were looking for ah for for certain for certain planetary ...\nThey were looking for a a a world of planetary Lyme is you know in in conjunction with a with which is the uh the star constellation\nAnd they were looking for a for a ... patients when I was like oh come on patients um that means or you're a planet that will ... will that will cover up of star or something like that\nAnd uh and and it makes a difference you know when I went out on a planet is in the I don't know if you've ever heard that before but uh I mean it makes a difference when I went out on a planet in our solar system is in a superior or inferior conjunction or or Perry here you're or whatever it makes a difference\nAnd are they take all under consideration now the the guidelines for all this\nI don't even ... I I have never seen it on line or anything there's many structures that go along with this and um and most most I guarantee you mostly the at least know most of the uh the the ... no no the ah the mainstream I'm a astronomers they know what\nBut ordinary people you know is is forbidden in other words\nBut since I've been I've been watching them\nSince I've been watching this on I've been doing it since I was a sound elementary school and um I don't know everything about him but I can I can read certain things\nIn it out I'll tell you this I Want you to think about this in in like do some studying or meditating on it if you read the book what I Would say is the account of the re creation of the earth the six day\nCreation yeah ... that's a good way to put it when when it when it talks about that God plays the light and those guys in order to just learn the times in this season's\nPass deeper than just\nThe earth spins around one there's one day fall own yup yup it is is different than that it is very much deeper than that absolutely and where I go to and maybe I'm wrong and I don't know if you've ever even contemplated there\nYou know Abraham he was the chosen one item was chosen ...\nAt the time of apple we don't get that when we just read the Bible or it let me go back to the Bible here just a second but April was chosen at the time of babble and then you know he was was there a\nAnd then they change their names ... Hammond Sarah and and then\nAfter everything that issue meal and odd that\nYou know April ham married again and had other children in the ... them to the east and those in my opinion the mad job with those that Abraham translated they must tied to them and said hey they looking for\nWhen it talks about babble if you look at the the real the wording of they\nWere building a tower up into the Hamptons mhm that's what they were trying to do in my opinion and from what I've read about it and it could be wrong but they were trying to figure out just fine and the times and all this stuff\nThings to can join right there with Avraham wow it is it's really fascinating\nYes it is more contemplate it\nYou know it it is I mean think about this the the the evil is the evil that\nRuling ever been on this planet and he was the first getting out some flood was a was was ... you know sort of a sudden Kush going really great grandson of a a Kurdish um no I'm Sorry not ... it's a um gosh what's the name of\nThat is Christian I don't know I think it is\nBut anyway thank you I think I think you're right yeah\nI'm thinking if somebody yeah and um and yeah he was a time Abraham was born right there near ... power since he was trying to find out where in the world is is this are they do that I'm supposed to get rid of you know because he'd come in my my my uh my strong with those\nThat told me that somebody has to be being born in you know he's he's this and he's that and and I need to get rid of him he couldn't find them new white confined comes in his own house you know he was on on on the ground his his right hand man was his right hand man soon it was terrible\nAnd he had no idea and said\nGo ahead go ahead and talk\nAnd in that time that cyber ham got away you know but the thing was um but yeah those real problem with someone who's on his ancestor some of them that came from um ... Afghanistan came from um from Iraq\nAnd now if I go on Saudi Arabia and it came from and um and there were the ones that were um that were that were tasked with ... with a we're following following we are uh the signs in that were there were peering into happens at the time about that they bring forth to\nThe brain that will bring forth um aside\nAnd they and that's one thing I don't think is crazy about uh signs in seasons and stores and all that some people do that\nBut it was I I really do vehemently believe that God put things in place that they knew that absolutely but you you you also have to think about this\nThere was no promise water we all were jammed piles and piles or people that do not have a cabinet was God graft okay yeah All right that's right we are brought into it therefore we're not looking for that\n... ... ... ... ... out I'll get any\nGyms house would not be looking for a messiah Ryan the purest sense of the word they're not looking for a savior they're just looking for something so what what it calls the papal from the east to even they calming looking for a messiah\nIf they had not been told and if you look over I think it's in jail isn't John I Know it is\nWhen ... says I have shape in all ... yeah that's right but he\nAnd I wonder if that were if those were not they just think that the vapor Hamza all spring after steroid that\nNot just something to think about yeah I mean it's it's really fascinating yet is to let your mind go wild on that so yeah there's a\nThere's a lot of things like that and one in particular\nA was a was ... was\nSo and you know you you also wonder you know why he didn't get the uh get is an ...\nBowl that yes that get real complicated oppose money yeah it it it it does do a lot but I'm the I'm I'm odd they love the eight ball I hated God they have that out of his own mouth I'm I'm a very complicated\nI'm doing some Research Center right now you don't want to believe it is\nWhat they\nAre if you look at the land that Esau was given his land was given it was in southern Judy from southern Judea only way to a a tune from ...

hundred bucks and bought her an incredibly beautiful wig oh wow\nBut there was a block there that she just could not accepted and chose rather to do in my mind that it was more convenient and more

astronomical and a lot of women they can't afford reconstruction and so they get free prosthetics and bras because of this event\nAnd that goes to their non for profit so when you can have reconstruction you can't afford it it's expensive and a lot of insurance will not cover it because it's not completely necessary [noise]\nBut it ... your feminine and he just gets hurt it's a lot it's ugly\nIt is so sad that with all the advances that have been made we just had a [noise] a guest on the other day who is part of an organization is trying to wipe polio off the face of the earth

is the minority and went into a feta state\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course are ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself\nBy nor will be technology it's been around for a long time and it helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on this journey where would you and I know that there is a pattern that you take the bus you know it it's kind of a formula right\nWell there's a yeah so the relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis\nUm there's different progression center used but it's basically a meditative type of program that's guided often guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences\nDuring even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have pets life regressions mhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up\nTo her inner self people experience different kinds of ah let's just say I open mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life for ... a regression type flashes are quite common\nAnd there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self\nIn to open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nKnow what types of questions could you ask yourself and then you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggested that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal\nAnd you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery cause information can be\nTransmitted many different ways it's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways\nTo the way that you receive information but uh people have all kinds of profound experiences and they awakened to their their true self and the answer is within them\nMhm yeah so the implication that personal growth and the spiritual awakening that are\nHappening in these can really be transformational and I like it because you guide your house and then I mean in a way your experience you William have died in in the direction that\nI Would have my own personal experience now my friend mine I freeze has been a guest on the show before she said that she has in the past encountered shows that need help and I think that's fascinating counts a little bit the\nCure a we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just mean ... to ...\nUh that's but that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen I that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact\nAnd um provide guidance let's say to people that and there are people that have died but they are law store for instance someone that may have died um quickly and they're just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI Know that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and I'm\nAt ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um [noise]\nAnd to let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMm mhm so to assist in crossing over have you ever done this after ... a tragic incident national tragic incident wearing masks so we don't want\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact ah during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way I imagine you're having coffee one morning in your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that were assisted in those um\nPeople that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its its functions in different names and in different cultures\nInstitute we we presented in I think I'm more or let's just say I'm very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can\n... that goes for all the training here that it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that's um understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nYeah which is great because really allowed to have their own experience and all that I Want to find out a little bit more about what other cultures\nBreak William thank you so much and

of body exploration and self and do this out of body experts\nIt sounds fun regulated type and out of body exploration thing and it sounds so well done it's very loud and something that William Bowman has led for almost Twenty years and they really don't think you can do\nOn your own where you live what are the culture has this existed in history\nOr Lisa from the very beginning of time I'm Out of body experiences are probably the quintessential I'm\nA way that throughout history people had profound experiences I mean look at the biblical like the revelations begins with I was in the spirit and if you look back through all the biblical text all the transformational type of experiences people\nTheir their consciousness was projected or extended let's say beyond their physical limits\nAnd that is in itself a form of out of body exploration it's just that was in two thousand years ago wasn't called but I don't think it goes all the way back to ancient Hindu Buddhist text\n'em to every culture and religion known to man if you start to read it objectively you'll see there's comments about this uh I was in the spirit or I was beyond my physical body let's put it that way and there they had this profound experience\nKaren and out of body and validate life after life\nWell it gives you that infinite number one it's a shocker for many people just to be aware of the fact that oh my God I continue its a verification that you continue beyond your body\nAnd that's that's a ... in itself a big life change or for people it's a weakening because then they realize oh my God there's I continue there's other things that are that are going on beyond the single experience\nAnd it really opens people's minds to the potential what they are think about it there's um seven and a half billion people on the planet and people don't have a clue where they're going to death they don't know where they come from before they were born\nAnd they don't know really what they are they they assume they're human being because they were they found themselves in the human body ... but in actuality consciousness\nUh can take on any for\nI I Know from having out of body experiences encountering are all kinds of life forms including by the way animals many people contact a love love pets six cetera during their out of body experiences and the pets are having out of body experience\nAny new ones that have come sooner already\nKnow or even the ones that are alive I write about this and my first book\nWhere my my dog McGregor would would follow me out of body and I also had a cat that would do that I mean this this is er just real events that are happening the fascinating people all over the world I mean we're a multi dimensional ... that's what we are\nAnd are biological body you know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time\nAnd then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration is that it's multi dimensional and that death is in our Lucian really young to know that it's been said but once you ...\nWith loved ones that were passed and you're doing this face to face this is life changing you no longer need a psychic the actors the intermediary you you you were empowered to discover the answers for yourself\nAnd really to find out what kind of journey or we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know when I shared this with you but I just interviewed Raymond Moody on my guy a show and you know the ... the grandfather and coined the term a life after death and um he had\nExpressed to me after Fifteen Years of doing this is that\nHe doesn't know for sure that that yeah life after death exists because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard thousands and thousands of reports of people who have experienced\nAs a life after life the phenomenon he still doesn't as a scientist as a low Jason ... is not know for sure this is\nExactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need\nBooks study research will never give you the kind of verification you can read a thousand books you could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic\nAnd it's not going to give you the inside and the verification you'll get from one out of body experience\nBecause suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards\nI mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\nBig and to get away from this big green and confusion and division I mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being your continuing your ... and beyond this temporary stage of development\nIt puts everything into a whole different perspective and I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist have been saying this for a long time\nBut you know we're more than our bodies and that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our revolution\nYeah and I meant to say that rain and he coined the term near death experience sorry I didn't mean life uh afterlife but\nThat's his website you know what I did my own Google Search on I just typed in near death experience in over twenty five million searches come up on Google were not the only ones that are interested in is this is becoming more and more of a\nA phenomenon a popular topic people are interested in what beyond disorder they always have been you know sort of play so much as the er anymore but\nI Want to ask you because you had an experience like as if you were sick and you had this experience for you you were that can you use this out of body experience to help you in some way can you tell us about that\nWell in two thousand eleven I discovered I had a serious a stage for cancer of the lymph nodes and tonsils and I it was a shock was come on very quickly out a large\nLymph nodes into anyway there was a serious issue and I had to get immediate\nHad to make quick decisions on this because it was a you know it spreads I ... broken and kept solution so I I went through traditional because it was so quick and so fast I did a traditional medicine\nBut um during my recovery I was having some really profound out of body experiences\nAnd in a sequence of events which I did not self initiate by the way these are just spontaneous out of body experiences which I was having why was recovering from cancer ...\nUh I had a cease healing experiences and it's difficult to explain this but\nIn one of them I found myself in this this white cue it was like a twelve meter pure square cube was segmented balls I write about this and adventures in the

I'm a belief system that of course is nothing but fear\nFear is a controlling mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population out and it still used today actively unfortunate way to control um ... you know societies\nOr we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be a feared\nAnd that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when when you have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal and it sounds a little grandiose split in you know that you know my God\nI'm more than my body I Am a mortal I'm I'm not some um week pathetic\nBeing that needs to be manipulated or told what to think ah you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be\nAnd that's amazing shift in

make that way but truly they are insignificant when you compare and two how vast our\nOur universe really is I'm Talking about I think beyond our body yeah\nIt was what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's\nJust the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that and you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance\nYou realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game at foot here you know the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer on of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his his era ... news that we\nHad the ridicule and you realize it's you know there's so much of a court and stuff that we need to know about ourselves\nThe greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self\n... that's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it suddenly awoke one day a new what we were\nAnd where we come from and

it going overreach where does your question my friend\nI'm curious as there's any relevance reporting on ... and a memory loss\nOr questioned questioned me not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\n... a little bit of both the uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself but not\nInterfering with your like everyday memory of needing to recall of certain things that you use all the time so to speak like war and stuff like that and drive in things like that\nOh I Would say definitely not a I can speak for myself I think my memory is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years or so I I well like I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory loss and ... and I'm a she's when you have a brain trauma that not so much the out of body technique it doesn't serve their brain memory patterns that All right\nNo I've not seen any correlation for them to um I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that live out of body experiences or have an incredibly productive and lives in their late years like Robert my road did and others that are written many books\nI'm In their later years let's say [noise]\nSo if anything I think there's the opposite I think ah you open up potentially um certain pathways that enhance your ability to ah remember and to function\nSometimes the have you ever experienced is Jamie an added ...\n... [noise] one of the Senate them than I can relate\nTo the same things and I'm just trying to figure myself out so to speak and um yeah ... make myself poll or whatnot with my function so\nGreat now that's great thank you so much for your phone call I appreciate it yeah that's\nOne of the techniques at William talks about is discovering yourself through out of body travel and I do like the fact that it doesn't end isn't associated with the TV I any type of trauma or brain injury we want to avoid those they\nThey are not sign no\nNo uh unfortunately a lot of people do it so should the two ... and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do a for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese or an element of near death\nBy the two were actually even though ... obese are part of the near death experience there also\nImportant distinction to make\nIt interesting and I couldn't even New Jersey I kind of line for days how I write\nHey Lisa the call is ... from inside the studio\nAnd casting [laughter] right [laughter] [laughter]\nHey this is where it might get a little weird but I was he a lawyer I was growing up in a place called ... town Pennsylvania we moved there when I was about to when I started getting visitation\nThat would they visit patients they gave me um I first saw a ... day I'd count for the school\nOr an fell down in this case load by hand those days where there is so those are two girls and their mouths but in terms of scaling it happened at the age of ... it would be one I saw the night before and the Dow but all they gave me a chance for our body\nI was younger I didn't know what it was how you liar own\nFascinating is very cool so you can be deeply college in his room\nIf they can um there are multiple um experiences and reports of people that have a let's just say knowledge of events\nAre not only in the past but in the future or what we would perceive as the future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time as we know we look at time is linear but yet those of us who have out of body experience is quickly realize\nThat for instance you can live a life in five minutes\nIt's ... it's there was no time as we perceive it ... in non physical reality\nAnd it's a whole and all that that's why it's important to learn about the the dynamics of our true home are true reality which is non physical cause it everything functions in a little different than it does here [noise]\nUh and that's why it's important to begin to read or leads to learn about\nHow non physical reality functions\nA fascinating can you ask in a long thinks you call a day and I appreciate and William can you ask in going into and out of body experience and media destiny question or\nHow does he get something out that really going into the future more than he can bring out your parents\nYou can you can ask anything a matter of fact that's one of the things I Try to\nUm teach people is to be open to asking if you have a question as to get the universe is willing to provide the answers your higher self or your higher mind whenever you perceive it\nWarns to assist you if you're open to that assistance and there's no limit to what can be it let's just say obtained um there's literally no limit ... have you have to ask\nYeah that's great I should go to our a wild card line to berry in St Louis Hi Danny how are you\nHighly surprised when I call I had a question your guest um years ago while we were of a town I did I ever really close to the past ... or we were out of town and I'm\n... and I just didn't let on my lap view him to be in a casket so I didn't go law and I was upset about that and I had this dream and that was\nIt's back for a ... a mall very familiar with but when I made the term I mean it was my dad he was standing who right there and it wasn't fuzzy or not but it was my dad ... and I said to him I just said dad and he he held those I end up\nAnd he said you need to settle down and it's okay and uh I I wanted to talk to him but he was actually fading out and I was I even said to him I said I don't really pleased to leave and he was gone and I woke up\nAfter I woke up I stress and everything was all gone and I guess my question is why this dream of that 'cause I was stressed out about it and it was in my imagination or does

physical ... kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up\nTo her inner self people experience different kinds of ah let's just say ... opening and mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common and\nThere's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self\nIn to open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nSay what types of questions could you ask yourself and then you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal\nAnd you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery cause information can be\nTransmitted many different ways it's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's\nReceive information but uh people have all kinds of

that may have died um quickly and they were just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI Know that that type of thing does happen quite a bit\nAnd I'm a ... that the Monroe Institute we offer

not through the trauma that to an actual workshop\nOut of body exploration thing and it sounds so well done it's very loud and something that William boom in his land for almost Twenty years and then really nothing you can do\nOn your own where you live what their cultures has this existed in history\nOr Lisa from the very beginning of time I'm Out of body experiences are probably the quintessential I'm\nA way that throughout history people's had profound experiences I mean look at a biblical like revelations begins with I was in the spirit if you look back through all the biblical text all the transformational type of experiences people\nTheir their consciousness was projected or extended let's say beyond their physical limits\nAnd that is in itself a form of out of body exploration it's just that was in two thousand years ago wasn't called but I don't think it goes all the way back to ancient Hindu the Buddhist text\n'em to every culture and religion known to man if you start to read it objectively you'll see there's comments about this uh I was in the spirit or I was beyond my physical body let's put it that way and there they had this profound experience\nKaren and added Bonnie and validate life after life\nWell it gives you that inside number one it's a shocker for many people just to be aware of the fact that oh my God I continue its a verification that you continue beyond your body\nAnd that's that's a ... in itself a big life change or for people it's a wake in it because then they realize oh my God there's I continue there's other things that are that are going on beyond the single experience\nAnd it really opens people's minds to the potential what they are I think about it there's um seven and a half billion people on the planet and people don't have a clue where they're going to death they don't know where they come from before they were born\nAnd they don't know really what they are they they assume they're human being because they were they found themselves in the human body\nMhm but in actuality consciousness uh can take on any for\nI I Know from having out of body experiences encountering are all kinds of life forms including

we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time\nAnd then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration is that it's multi dimensional\nAnd that death is in her Lucian really I'm no no that's been said but once you encounter and experience and communicate with ...\nThis is life changing you no longer need a psychic to act as the intermediary you you you were empowered to discover the answers for yourself and really to find out what kind of journey or we all on\n'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know when I shared this with you but I just interviewed Raymond Moody on my guy a show and you know the ... the grandfather and coined the term a life after death and\nUm she had\nExpressed to me after Fifteen Years of doing this\nThat he\nDoesn't know for sure that that yeah life after death exists because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard\nThousands and thousands of reports of people who have experienced as a life after life just phenomenal and he still doesn't as a scientist as a load Jason ... is not know for sure\nThis is exactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need\nBooks study research will never give you the kind of verification you can read a thousand books you could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic\nAnd it's not going to give you the inside and the verification you'll get from one out of body experience\nBecause suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards\nI mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\nBig and to get away from this big green and confusion in division I mean once you realize that you're you're not just a

children's out of body experience\nI have received thousands of letters from over the decades from parents who share their experiences with about their children\nUnfortunately I'm In our society sometimes he's or misinterpreted and you know they they end up taking their child to a psychologist or psychiatrist because it's out of there\nOut of the norm for our family to deal with so they end up giving the child Ritalin or something else to calm them down or whatever uh it's unfortunate because there it's just natural\nYou know ... or ... you know what's funny is that Ninety over Ninety percent of Americans believe that there is an afterlife\nThat we are non physical spiritual being and in other words if we are as most people believe then why would we be locked into a biological machine for our entire life Web when that's not what we are\nWe we have a natural ability to explore beyond their physical limits the Buddhist sub known this forever that's why they train young

the out of body experience um in other words\nLoved to dissolve that fear and you do it fully conscious not just in a dream\nBut imagine it works in a dream to but imagine how much more powerful that would be if you're fully absolutely conscious and you do the same technique where you are literally dissipate in dissolving fears are blocks\nThat's the great block for self knowledge has fear right it's like it's a great block then all of us confront and one way or another it's it's an invisible barks at everybody create surround themselves [noise] and that's important I find that\nOut of body exploration gives us an ability to\nConfront and dissipate and dissolve\nThose fears that end up uh let's just say looming in our our ability to express ourselves fully in this life\nAlthough the eighty six percent to respond and supported no fear nose hairs tearing out of money that they had a very peaceful saying\nYes according to this survey\nHaiti that's very high\nIt yes it was it was

make them that way they truly they are insignificant when you compare and two\nHow vast our our universe really is I'm Talking about I think beyond our body yeah yeah\nIt was what's so important is for us to have her own transformation or experiences I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know butter you just look at it like it it's\nJust the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that and you know it and that's makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance a political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game that foot here you know the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer on of anyone else any belief system government religion and you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful [noise]\n[noise] yes and I think more of a thing to understand that and get out of the

long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself\nBut not\nInterfering with your like everyday memory of needing to recall of certain things that you use all the time so to speak like war and stuff like that and drive in things like that\nOh I Would say definitely not a I can speak for myself I think my memory is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years\nOr so I I well like I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory loss and ... and I'm a she's when you have a brain trauma but not so much the out of body techniques that doesn't his served their brain memory patterns that All right\nNo I've not seen any correlation for them to um I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that live out of body experiences\nOr have an incredibly productive and lives in their late years like Robert my road did and others that are written many books I'm In their later years let's say [noise]\nSo if anything I

thank you so much for your phone call I appreciate it yeah that's\nOne of the techniques at William talks about is discovering yourself through out of body travel and I do like the fact that it doesn't end isn't associated with the TV I any type of trauma\nOr brain injury we want to avoid those they they are not sign no no\nUh unfortunately a lot of people do associate the two ... and it's

just say knowledge of events\nAre not only in the past but in the future or what we would perceive as a future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time as we know we look at time is linear but yet those of us who have out of body experience is quickly realize\nThat for instance you can live a life in five minutes\nIt's ... it's there was no time as we perceive it ... in non physical reality\nAnd it's a whole and all that that's why it's important to learn about the the dynamics of our true home are true reality which is non physical 'cause everything functions in a little different than it does here [noise]\nUh and that's why it's important to begin to read or least learn about\nHow non physical reality functions\nAnd fascinating can you ask in a long and thanks for your call Dave I appreciate it and we can you asked in going into and out of body experience and media destiny question or\nSomething that really going into the future more than\nHe giving out your parents\nYou can you can ask anything a matter of fact that's one of the things I tried to\nUm teach people is to be open to asking if you have a question as to get the

on my lap view him to be in a casket so I didn't go law and I was upset about that and I had this dream\nAnd that was the least about the time and that was chase\nReally if but when I made the term I mean it was my dad he was standing who write better and it wasn't fuzzy or not but it was my dad ... and I said to him I just said dad and he he held those I end up\nAnd he said you need to settle down it's okay and uh I I wanted to talk to him but he was actually fading out and I was I even said to him I said dad don't leave pleased to leave and he was gone and I woke up\nAround for a walk I stress and everything was all gone and I guess my question is\nLike this dream of that 'cause I was stressed out about it and it was in my imagination or does he think that maybe that was my dad actually contacted me from the ... you know life after death round settled down because it actually work\nYeah I think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report the kind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream logic experience\nUh the universe is a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continue on and yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual passing\nThe the the chance of contact is incredibly high\nAnd often will perceive it and a dream like environment because we're more open when our ego mind is when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to experience is but yeah I think that was a valid\nAbsolutely valid or contact ... uh I knew I had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know he's had some form of contact\nAnd that we're kind of regard with a loved one\nHe sounds very healing and they\nSaid well it is very healing I I think that's a wonderful

I adopted him when I say I I Want to adopt a family do you get to know kind of what the family's needs or these sort\nOf yes when they apply for assistance there's actually a description of the family the family members their ages there genders and their wish lists ... so you could actually be more specific say out always adopt a child who loves a Spiderman\nFor the last four years I've dropped the adoptive families single father with a young boy he won't Spiderman items so you you do get to know a little bit about them you can choose either delivered items to us\nAnd we will actually get the items to the family or you can deliver directly to the family\nThat's the choice of the the adopter so this is almost like a supplemental to Santa is you know I'm getting a than help out the the big guy with the ...\nAnd this is amazing I really do encourage folks I Know it's early in the year but with the reason we're talking this early this year is because\nI Want people to take up that calling to adopt a family kind of get to know that family kind of what their needs are and that allows you to do it on a really personal basis I mean some people like Neal\nBrightened ... nothing wrong with that ... also they were not starting checks away absolutely no we'll turn them away but\nWhen you can realize exactly where that money is going or exactly were your gifts are going to uh it really personalize it and makes you realize here's who I Am actually\nHelp right we've even had families adopt a famous Christmas and actually do it so early they can plan for Thanksgiving feast oh wow delivered the family as well OK kind of taking in everything to do with the holiday because it all strings together ... families days get interest is it'll all of a blur one\nBig holiday season and and again you're you're finding these families through a sort of toys for Todd's but\nYou mentioned different churches in the area they are essentially families that are in their congregation or families they meet during their outrage\nRight to the families that they assess throughout the year that they know they're in need we provide the applications we collect all the applications clear it through our database\nAnd make sure that they're not applying more than one place for it so that the most people are adopted and there's the duplication that some if one family tries to go here there and everywhere\nThen they're they're not allowed into the\nRight program I understand I understand well we don't want people to slip through the cracks too so people teaming up together again because you can go to a hands on river region doubt or all the information there you can look up the Christmas clearing house there's also all sorts of other things going on with hands on average Dutch or all the time and for maybe for folks who are\nIn a church right now maybe they're starting up a nonprofit they just haven't thought about this is a bigger way that\nA hands on a river region is really a

hands I'll give a region dot org and I encourage folks I'm just an Internet guy maybe ... hands on river region dot org rule Leslie Barker thank you so much for joining us Joey everyday\nAnd applied for Montgomery Birmingham I've always wanted to be a police officer Montgomery I'm pretty much blessed me would give me a job as a police officer and\nUm it doesn't take long for a police officer to get adjusted and found out what the nature so in Ninety four Ninety five a stone accident in ... Wilson\nTurn it down every time I ... a bit ... from W is a pay a news so she actually started the ball rolling she acts one time and they said yes right we're started ... program and\nThat started to roll a thing everything up and fall is getting a board members bonding funding and they asked me would be a liaison to the program and promotes that started\nUm prompts off his back in Ninety six\nOh I I have to know what made you always want to be a police officer so I was like you knew early ...\nWell my mom says about seven eight years old I Would always run toward the body to run toward the um the incident that's going on and I would always be\nIn the news about seeing a black and white core but might think I'm associated with just TV [noise] so you know TV shows where you had well yet more of a black and white issue where it was more you out a good or bad\nThere was no in between around when you watch TV you really can't tell to get jobs and the bad guy\nAnd the way they're portrayed and police officers now science thing you can't really tell to good police officer from the bad police officers watch majority of the mainstream in television shows but\nBack in those days it took me to see 'em shows like ... votes or chips are always wanted to put on the uniform and do it\nOn a big theme ... right now my life and in on this show we also talked a lot of artists and artist sensitive stuff at a big thing in my life is the art we create wind up\nReally much ah influencing everybody's life ... sounds like that's a a big deal in your case and that's a spectacular it's a virtue innate folks like yourself out there running towards the fight is a good guy as Susan what about you how did you get involved with all the\nWell I have a degree in communications and I was actually working at W. S. S. I. as a news producer um along with Beth and ah when they just had a volunteer board of directors with crime stoppers but it really wasn't getting anywhere because\nThe volunteer board of directors all had other fulltime jobs so they really wanted to hire someone full time and I'm being a producer\nAnd I'm a new round the house and you know you push everything you get it all together and all that kinda stuff and so that's where the qualifications they were looking for when they hire someone\nUm so I started in September of two thousand\nAnd I'm really just um you know worked hard and got fundraisers going and got some other grant money coming in and I'm pretty much held down the foreign till I neither one day Tony would join and to really take it off\nNow I Want to remind folks the hotline number the tip line number what number to call\nIt's two one five stop but there are other ways uh that's how we get most of our to answer the phone but there's also you can text to tip to us um [noise] you can go on line to our website two one five stop dot com and submitted chat via our Web\nUm there is an app called ... that she can um\nUpload download and I'm submitted to that way so there are several ways and everything that we do any tip that comes in through a social media or through our website is totally encrypted there is no way that it can be traced back some people still do not have to worry about their identity being revealed\nAnd also to add um I'll tip lines twenty four seven are monitored holidays are you going to six days a year about ... person so even when we started off as we have a sort of followed a call center that does nothing but as ... I'm twenty four seven\nThat the one tip line numbers two one five stop two one five seven eight\nAnd with the local area code now I Want to move away from the the practical well actually it's still remains on the practical but on some other ways we can help out law enforcement you mentioned\nThat this was brought in to the police chief at the time what is the exact arrangement with crime stoppers are the police department and the only non profit technically yes we are nonprofit\nWe have no connection with the police department except for when they give us cases or video evidence the broadcast and community we're sort of a middleman between community or the media and the police department or law enforcement agencies\nOkay because I Am real big on a\nDeveloping I guess in a way you could put it it'd be non traditional police services or community services are we brought up a second ago cases of domestic violence these sorts of things I've talked to the folks the famous sun shines a center and the way they cooperate or was a police department and\nUh what other solutions are what other things do you think we could provide for meals vantage point I don't mean to put you on the spot but you know what can we provide to the police department that would help make their job's easier but also Mexican made it a little more vocal what third\nTuesday to monitor you one example third Tuesday or the month a we have a host a retail last mentioned meeting a with all the last one mentioned managers in a liberal region um when they come we share information\nUm shoplifting deaf trends a fraud just this which was yesterday just yesterday we identified two people one is going to be adopted property first a subject and another is going to be multiple um the\n... and ... if they can combine all the things that he told them they would probably be in attendance tens of thousands so that tells the city absolutely nothing\nAlone no law enforcement and ball to support it we do have law enforcement at the table that pretty much gather information but it's just the last one mentioned managers communicating between themselves we would love to do the same thing with neighborhood associations neighborhood watch programs where we um\nWe went up to ... be a practical doesn't have a traditional cropper mentioned unit but they're starting one and pretty much happened ... bill um assist them in starting a proper mentioned you know because that's you know what I was a cropper mentioned also McGovern city police department so I'm giving them free advice as far as\nHow to conduct the neighborhood watch meeting how to start up a neighborhood watch program how to communicate with your neighborhood associations neighborhood watch programs also we actually if you have a neighborhood watch or neighborhood association what you're not formal\nMore the police department did not know that you exist we Tom ... the Montgomery give that two one five stopped called a ... a two one five stop number a call\nOr during the daytime hours so we can get your information so we can send your information to law enforcement so there'll be a more able to come to your meetings and to pretty much introduce themselves and tell you what's going on your community and how you can help them\nThat was one point down it's going to make to I'm not only to restart my camera area that we serve I Want to talk to 'em and more county ... county um and we also had another initiative that we're working on that I that I feel really good about and that is a gang intervention prevention initiative [noise]\nAh well we're working with law enforcement and all of our and the region area along with the department of corrections in the U.S department of justice and the U.S attorney's office no district of Alabama a where we're trying to get everybody to network has you know crime has no borders gangs have no borders I mean they go\nAnd they go that's what we're seeing as a trend in video ... video of a people using stolen credit cards and things like that\nAnd that's what's so good about crime stoppers as we were like I\nCan do it or like in the middle man for it to bring all these agencies together and let the network\nAnd that's one thing that I really love about crime stop hers is that we are a community program and we get the community to come together you know if we all get together and then we can do a lot more than just single all by ourselves you know we have a lot of power if we get everybody to the table\nI Love you and I love the idea of local participatory government that everybody feels like they're involved it's not some things that are they're being kind of course\nNot you know we're not going to reinvent the wheel you know there are a lot of things out there that work less really pulled from those things and work together as\nA law enforcement agencies have so much going on so many cases that they're working oh it's almost impossible for them to reach across the\nAisle to another law enforcement agency and say hey this is what I'm working on and you have anything like that they do it on some cases but you think about the things that affect us most like the average shoplifting people don't understand when someone's shoplift from a store that goes into their budget\nOf stores budget so they have to account for that I mean Parsons go up if shoplifters just keep shoplifting at a certain store front\nProperty go when a value of the er so not um goes up that hurts me that her ... hurts the economy as well especially when you have a business as a ... a force for theft\n... and closed down shop and leave and that's the last thing that we won't\nEspecially some of these big box stores and you have a huge base property that is not easy to read utilized\nA humane society and the department of agriculture and all sorts of places trying to get the animals some help and that's when I realized horses themselves have a really hard time getting help in the state and so I got the runaround nobody really wanted to do anything and\nSo I thought about contacting a horse rescued they should know what to do\nAnd I couldn't find one [laughter]\nSo my idea was well how about starting one [laughter]\nThere you go ahead and taking the initiative to actually write and do it yourself and um I Want to go back very quickly how did you wind up coming here and the Alabama and what brought you from Germany and all the way over here\nIt was my husband [laughter] no my husband was stationed in Germany and then um we moved over here and he retired he was military okay until now we're here\nOkay well um we're glad to have you heard all about saying we are at especially because I I Know you had to be daunting it had to be it doesn't just go from there is no horse rescue around here I Can't find anybody to help to all of a sudden I have one up and running\nBut did you have you ever done anything like this before starting an organization running or not they would I had no idea so you have to learn from square\nOr act I I had to do research on how to get the five oh one C. three to become a\nAn interesting party for donors I had to learn on how to take care of horses that are in dire need because all I knew at the time was you know I had a horse myself how to take care of a healthy horse but I did not know how to take care of the courses so I had to learn pretty quick\nAnd then I realized also that a lot of people\nNot people by law enforcement and general didn't really know\nHow to assess horses in horse cases what are they looking for all this good stuff so I ended up going to many different classes and got certified\nBy an equine cruelty investigations okay so I I actually have a certification from the University of Colorado Colorado State university and now I'm a certified equine cruelty investigator I have the title but I'm not employed by anybody\nOkay um we're talking to Monica ... founder of dusty trail horse risk you know\nHad had you worked in other fields before and you decided to leave this these other areas and jump into this like it it seems like this was truly an event in your life you'd always loved animals as you said um but it seemed like it truly was of into the lives of woke you up and said this is what I have to do\nI'm a person when I see a problem I Can't walk away and turned a blind eye if I see a stray dog on the road I Will not keep driving if I see an animal that's injured or hurt I Will try to find the owner fight you know find a solution to the problem\nUm like with stray dogs I'd rather have an animal put to sleep and starve to death that's my take on it\nAnd it was just shocking to me\nThat nobody else cared enough or so it seemed that time and so I really don't have any other background it just was the problem was there and we needed to solve it\nOn a vote that's why I Love the fact you have the Edmund Burke quote on your brochure it it's not that people are out there trying to um heard horses I'm sure there's some sick people out there but it's not as though folks are it's a ...\nAn odd so I'm Glad that you are ... you've created this place I'd I've studied a little bit of non profit law and I've I've gotten to know a good few folks and nonprofits are here in in the area and it is a\nQuite the task of it it was not easy to learn all that but that is for no more so I Would love to go into a little bit of exactly uh some of the missions we say horse rescue ... sort of things are involved in rescuing these animal\nIt starts out with the initial report 'em I Will take Montgomery County as an example\nThe Montgomery humane society will get a call about a horse that is emaciated in a field and they will look at it and if they confirmed that it is a bad case they will call me and say\nCome on out there let's take a look and see what we can do so that's when I meet with them and we'll take a look at the animal\nAnd my goal is to be able to educate an owner to improve the situation for the horse and keep the horse that's the goal we don't need any horses I don't want anybody source I'm happy if they can stay where they are\nIf the horse is either being abused or there's no honor to be found\nOr whatever the circumstance that it's so bad already that we have to seize it then um it comes to the rescue than we have to pick it up and that's where the first turtles starts truck and trailer NFL horses on the ground and can't get up anymore we need the\nStraps and and had sat around to all the items that we use to pick up the horse we need the manpower pick up that animal put it in the trailer bring it to the rescue and then we have to get a veterinarian out and that's where it starts\nGoing out and managing their unique problems with the vets have to deal with each it's you know I just kind of like people's health we'll ever\nAnd on and many different causes for certain types of appearances so you've got to figure out is today health problem that we can fix is it really a health problem\nThat you can fix it said something to owner dead is it something that the horse had genetically is it just just quote unquote starvation that we can fix how long has it been that way how old is the animal there's a lot of stuff that goes into it\nOn a ... there's one specific example you're showing me off air of first I Want to let everybody know that you can reach Monica and her staff a dusty trails horse rescue all one word shrink together dot org dusty trails horse rescue dot org and on Facebook and on Facebook\nUm when will also be making sure to get that up on our website it'll be water broadcasting dot com our viewpoint page um where folks can reach you um there was a book you were showing me all fair and the initial story um what was his name he knew he was on miracle miracle\nAnd Merkel you go to report that a horse had\nDied correct the report that initial report was there is a dead horse in the field and that it had been there and when the lady drove by she saw the horse lift his head well her head and she called us saying oh my God\nEverybody thought that was his dad that horses alive please do something that's how we got in touch with the humane society because it was in our county and we all raised out there and when we got there the horse was on the ground she looked dead\nAnd I started whistling at the horse and she picked up her head and tilted our head backwards and had that blood curling scream\nI've never had that before or since then and uh we you know got permission to get on the property and we got there and they called the vet already\nAnd uh we managed to pick her up with that assistance put her on the trailer\nBrought her home it was a very long road to recovery or and um we weren't supposed to Neymar because the veterinarians didn't think she was going to make it and my rule of thumb is nobody dies without a name\nEverybody will have one so we named her miracle because that's what it took\nAnd it took many months for her to recover she had opposite says firmly in on one side that were you among us we had to\nLance ... says and trade her and pick her up because every time she laid down she couldn't get back up on our own say every time it took more people to pick her back up a few hours later she laid back down than we had to flip are because she can lay on one side for too long\nThat's worth all horses we call them down or horses because they can't get up\nAnd so it it she made it and she's now adopted in the happy as\nAn so how long does a process ... you've founder or how long did you just shoot the way they land there for two days that we know for sure but ruling has said that was for my goodness how does or something like this how does that happen is a truly somebody purchased or owner and neglected or\nIn this specific case the person just didn't care just the thought\nThat he was only two years old at the time she had one horseshoe on so we know\nShe had been reading a few weeks prior ... and she was ... and she was completely emaciated skin and bones on top of that is why she couldn't get up and ready because she was so skinny muscle mass what's gone she just didn't have the strength anymore\nAnd so slowly over time and and the process of months I'm Guy and\nWhen when horses like this come in which is the extreme case we feed them every two or three hours twenty four hours a day seven days a week through the night [noise] um we have to do that no matter what the weather is\nIt's it's dedication it really is if if you don't love what you do you're not going to be able to do this kind of rehabilitation and\nWhat is it like for you to say I know I Can't fathom necessarily 'cause I didn't live but I you mentioned that scream that has to be on wrenching um\nWell [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] Fox\nNews I'm Karen McHugh just

Nineteen Ninety spent the next ten months in the tropics\nIn fact I got out and went into explored the and the job scenario out outside the army you wanted to hang out with those civilian people there was a number of reasons for that but we'll get into that later but the I think it was it was a good step for\nThe gods must love civilians who may so many of these right okay we're talking about warriors\nAs we discussed last week with autumn there's lawyers at every level of society and and as you pointed out a couple of times\nWho has to be committed and focused as if you're gonna be a warrior we're gonna talk mostly military and again don't want to put down the other wars certainly as I've said a hundred times on the show people in law enforcement or not our brothers in arms but there certainly are first cousins and valor\nThey put their lives on the line every day for people that don't even know\nMany of them don't even like him so please don't take that as an exclusive but we're talking about people in uniform right everybody puts on the uniform better be prepared to become a warrior is that a fair statement you know\nAny of that isn't exactly what I was thinking as funny you should say that because to be a warrior you need to train to be a warrior I think inside a lot of us think of ourselves as warriors\nBut the men and women that are going into battle they need to train every single day as closely as they can to replicate combat conditions because you never really know how you're going to react so the closer you can get to replicate those conditions and training day in and day out to be a warrior\nAnd to know your enemy no the order of battle the more that you know the more you trust the people around you the better you're going to fight and I think that is true in any scenario in life whether you're in business or whether you're in sports\nBut especially when you're a warrior you have to train and you got to know your equipment you got to know your friends and you gotta know the enemy preparation is what you said and that is one of the keys to being a warrior I think\nWell and in business you are not going to be competing for a contract and you want it and I don't\nThat's competition but it's not like a shot right nonetheless it's no less the same thing for and the people who joined the military may be they never deployed maybe there and the guard reserves are never activated\nBut they still have decided for whatever reason usually a multitude of reasons to put their lives available can be sent to combat you might be a medic or you might be a mechanic or you might be a\nFinance clerk or you might be an infantryman or you might be anywhere but\nIn the military you ask me what you want to take what you get and my dad's best friend who served in World War two as a replacement guy in Europe said you come in and you're a\nMechanic and suddenly we need fifty two type grabbers you're now a tank driver [laughter] that might be how you were trained but here's what we need to the arms of limits for that yeah for sure and so therefore if you put the uniform on you better be ready to be a warrior regardless of what you're currently assigned as\nAnd that's I think a key issue this is going to give them the front lines of freedom and we're discussing the nature of lawyers with matinees\nThen there are those who suddenly find themselves in a combat zone whether it's in a combat role or not I suspect that would appear motivation\nHope so yeah I mean in in that and that's a that's a bad place to be it's a bad place to be in a combat zone but a non combat essentially non combat personnel and find yourself in a convoy that gets attacked I think unfortunately\nMany people don't feel they're ever going to be in close combat situation but if your deployed to a combat theater of operations you\nNeed to sort of get your mind wrapped around that warrior spirit and say can be attacked at any time perhaps even by civilians for whatever reason so you always have to be on top of your game and that again preparation and I think the mindset of being a combat or your that's the biggest thing\nSort of a model or something that says everybody's inevitable\nAre your primary thing is you're also an infinite that attitude would carry then there are those who\nConduct combat artillery fighter pilots those kind of people who attacked the enemy but don't do it personally mhm and then there are the people the close combat people the infantry armor special ops type people who potentially go face to face with the enemy those are sort of different levels\nBut all of them need that warrior mindset and all of them sort of need to be prepared to be anywhere in that spectrum right\nYeah I Love the or the marine mindset is that they train everybody to be a fighter and then after that okay you can go and be an electrician or a cooker because they need everything but all those and all that says they all know how to fight\nVery similar to the Israelis everybody has to be good script into the army men and women so they teach everybody how to be in uniform Adam you soldier and how to fight and protect the country and then you can go back to civilian life and be an accountant or a sales person or an inventor or whatever that everybody has a taste of what it's like to serve\nAnd to be in the military and to protect the country to important\nYeah it's really important person is more likely to motivate you to do that if you have seen your school will get attacked by a rocket or something like that here in the United states given the the warriors spirits a warrior attitude is something that everybody in our military needs it's something that needs to be appreciated understood\nAnd even replicated by we citizens because none of us protect we want to be victims either\nSo that's something that is transferable to the civilian world\nThough not in the aggressive sense right\nYeah I think it's important for civilians to recognize the level of commitment and the level and the intensity and sometimes violence that the military has\nBut they need to also understand that we are just people just like they are we're not different kinds of people we're just dedicated ourselves to a life of protecting the country and to do that you have to be willing not only to sacrifice physically but also to be prepared to be very violent\nAnd that takes a toll on people you see all the P. T. S. D. coming back from the latest wars in Afghanistan and Iraq\nAnd I think there are people in our society they think that we love the violence and we're out there just to kill people and stuff that the farthest thing from the truth I mean we come back damage from what we have to go through and what we have to do and I think it's so important to realize that war especially close combat takes a toll on everyone that's involved we talked about the difference between men and women last week\nI think one of the key things about men for better or for worse is that we were able to sort of compartmentalize things yes and in the middle of a battle your body gets shot you do not have time to grieve not even a second you know the guy that picked him off got his crosshairs right on you so what are you going to do to get out of this position and make things right\nAnd you know it might be weeks or even months later for that comes back into your mind and all of a sudden you find yourself grieving so there's there's an intense emotional toll that it takes on a person to be in combat but that whole has got to be later it can't be in the moment and that's all part\nOf the nature of the warrior right there is a lot more to discuss about this and folks on because they haven't met back on regularly as we pursue the definition of the idea of a warrior Matt thank you for taking time to

going to get locked up I've got a a as a retirement program that little I did a little chastising a little earlier before the break a\nMedical workers are being done wrong in this city because they should be able to take money out when you're fifty nine and a half or even though they're still employed if anyone is listening to this is a management person you can change that all you got this tale investment company to change that or get that you know what out ... and lives will be another when they will do it for you\nAnd I want to say right now I Know for a fact\nThat uh and you do too I'm sure in in the medical field right you know nurses or hard they sure do now when they went on that TV show what was that the view mhm I just want to put my foot through the television talking about nurses didn't work hard and they\nOr you know just a bunch of prima donnas now I Know that these are not been in the hospital is and I know you know nurse comes in their spends ten minutes for me I'm not one not only one on that floor and she's got to look after\nAnd you know\nI'm a ...\nThese people deserve the respect of course their male nurses to right they're out there and there were there taking care of folks and then not getting the appreciation and they they don't need this problem that you just mentioned\nWell it's not just nurses you got the laboratory people ... who who should have a lot more respect in you know they're they're kind of like the unknowns you got the X ray and the radiological paypal or you've got to physical therapy people you've got all the you got all these different aspects\nYou you've got the transportation people you got the pharmacy\nYou know everybody works as a as a you know as a unit that showed a hospital or machine right\nAh but the fact is when you when when a when a hospital\nPuts together a retirement plan and they get snow covered and I'm going to use the word snuck it by the investment uh people\nInto a allowing a contract to sign that they can't take the money out when they're fifty nine and a half and even though they're stealing board ... is something wrong with it because a lot of people break down and they want to start working part time or they want to work\nOr somewhere else and keep that job a little bit you know but the fact that they if they work in just one day a month\nThat investment company says you can't have your money and you're like sixty five sixty six seven years oh almost and you can't get any money\nThen you have to quit your job so you can get your money that's something wrong with that picture of you know a lot of people when they get to that and a half they deserve they said well we're just doing it so that they cause they might spend their money I get that patriot but what if you're fifty nine and a half and you've got a quite a bit of money and then you want to take some of it out and put it\nWhere it's safer for example because maybe they don't have a safe mode that you could go into and then you're kinda stuck in a\nMode that you don't want to be and they need to put some more liquidity and these things so these four O. one K. is are getting that way ...\nWell three bays and four fifty seven\nUh those those plans haven't gotten to where the four oh one case have got brought one K. is they're still not where they need to be ... but the full ... have more protection mechanism a lot of them will allow you to take out a what they call a just a withdrawal\nAnd usually they put in there like fifty nine and a half is usually the the primary age but they can put in their forty five\nOr they could put thirty five mhm it's all in the plan documents okay\nIn the in the more liberal it is I see people all the time and trying to borrow their own money out of a for all three bay paying interest they're restricted they don't get their money okay some people would not say if I get it I get the pitcher mhm but when you're fifty nine and a half and you can get your money I think he went too far with it way too far\nSo how can you tap your retirement savings without getting hit with a penalty by the government that's another story but we're going to talk about a centrally ah that's called a Seventy two tea\nYou say what is a Seventy to take as many as ... Seventy to the distribution oh are you know\nLet's say you did have a four O. one K. they would allow you to take some money out before you were fifty nine and a half okay and if you worry then you're you're dealing with a good company okay maybe you can be forty five\nSo you say look I'm going to continue to work\nBut I Need to get a hold of some of that money because I've got children to send the college I got this got that and ah maybe they set up a program for the for the the nice thing with Trump maybe they didn't and we're going to get more into that\nSo the Seventy two tea will let you take a distribution of payments\nOver a certain period of time I think it's five years do hope that at a certain amount you can't turn it off you can but if you do then all of them the money gets the penalty okay so if you had a hundred thousand dollars maybe you could take out five thousand dollars or ten thousand or whatever the number would be\nGulf Coast is not really prepared to handle storms this size or this is not like it's a you know in Miami and South Florida the built to handle stuff like this are the Gulf Coast is really I mean they do category for storms these are brutal these are real storms\nAnd um they're going to get a real storm surge and real when that uh the last several hours and it's a it's brutal I mean if you're if you're listening by ap and and uh in in South Alabama southeast Alabama\nOr or south of ... he's been at the Florida Panhandle by all means do the normal stuff you can do fill your bad sides up with water immediately playing them out real well so you're not\nDrink and garbage and and you know foot odor and all that but clean your when your bad says out real well and then go ahead and fill them all the way up to the brim you'll need that water in the days ahead as powers cut in your water no longer flows you'll need it to go to the bathroom\nYou can flush our toilets that water in an emergency you can drink that water if you didn't plan ahead and buy\nBottled water or at least keep you alive for a few days or hopefully has some canned food beans and meats and other things on hand ah 'cause you're gonna need um you're gonna need and they'll go ahead and cut power probably in advance of this storm hitting 'em in the next I Would guess hour or two just so that as power lines fall on houses they're not\nA frying houses and starting fires\nSo [noise] uh it's gonna be weird it's gotta be weird and in North Florida and he will inevitably or not much you can do about it from here right now\nAnd inevitably your church group all want to go down there this weekend and and help [noise]\nMake sure the local officials are inviting you and make sure the local officials are inviting you in because until they get power restored until they get the roads cleared until they get the major debris fields out of the way a and law enforcement professionals in there to make sure people aren't coming in from out of town to loot\nUm they're not going to want you they're not gonna want you and and in fact you're going to cause more harm and loss of life and and damage then they're not going [noise]\nUm [noise] there will are inevitably be frauds that that pop up in in a fundraising as a result of this you'll see go fund me accounts that are fraudulent that are just not true or you will see a\nShady characters taking up money presumably for this group for that group\nOr do you do diligence these are the times when you when you honestly donate to big organizations I Know the red cross is taking a beating over the years for the c._e._o. salary and some of the some of the donations they made and political positions they've taken but the reality is they do a pretty good job on the ground in the immediate aftermath of storms\nOr Catholic social services always does a fine job after storms or one of the premier organizations\nAre and I'm sure there are others I'm not advocating for any one over another but this is a a this is a real storm this is a real storm I'm always wanted to ... storm um\nThis looks set to make landfall with at least a hundred and forty mile an hour winds if it doesn't we could substantially the next couple of hours but you could do\nWhat you could do a but it doesn't appear like it's going to and so if you detect a serious or somber tone from your home we'll talk show host today that is why that is why this is a real storm it is going to cause a loss of life there are people who cannot evacuate for reasons of poverty or um\nOr ill health or or just flat foolishness I just saw a video on Fox News of someone's surfing in the in the ways that certainly probably not where I Would be a if I was stuck\nSafety from the storm surge and the wind um obviously the\nUh the rest of the destruction I mean look you walk outside of to her and you never I mean do they want to go to Tuscaloosa after the tornado where the tornado hit areas or have you ever been to one of these cities after a or a category three or four or five hurricane hits it's bizarre I'm\nEvery everything's wiped off the map everything's gone um\nYou know all the all the major landmarks you use to navigate are gone uh buildings are completely missing particularly things like convenience stores and uh you know build buildings that traditionally are not going to fight and restructure structured well to to handle that kind of a storm some of your nicer housing developments may withstand uh\nWith with nothing more than last ruse and poked out windows or best really a best case scenario if you if you get through this thing with a missing roof and some and some window damage\nYou better catch yourself lucky\nOr if you if you walk away from this if if you're down in the heart of this so even as much as fifty sixty Seventy miles inland they'll they'll have some severe tree damage in power line damage but in addition of probably some small structure damage so this is this is the real story\nUm that's why I opened with trying to reason with hurricane season by Jimmy Buffett in addition to being a great song it's just not great bumper music because it's a little slow or put on a day like today with a somber sort of opening um\nIt it it works it works so we will keep an eye on that its category for hurricane right now it'll continue to make its way into does not look to impact in any way whatsoever our listening area\nOr by traditional terrestrial radio standards but when you consider the number of people that we can see you on your IP address is ... a listing on the ads on the website and other things [noise] and plus people tell us you know hey I'm listening for mobile wisdom from doping or whatever\nIf you guys are listening right now from those areas mobiles you'll be fine a Gulf shores does a Gulf shores in the U.S gives me Orange Beach will be five\nOr adult is going to get some when you're probably not going to have catastrophic loss of life or or mass destruction failure but you'll you'll have some way and then there'll be some roof damage and the power lines down and and and some trees down and things like that and in the wire grass so a\nGood luck and Godspeed you're going to need it our number two seven to nine two to eight if you want to get into seven to nine two to eight when we get back we'll look\nPast the storm at some of the news going on I got some thoughts on Nikki Haley ah now that we know a little more [noise] that's I mean there's a runoff election is not just in Montgomery but the key municipal run off elections around the state [noise] and uh [noise]\nWell fallout from the uh I baby late fall out from the James Baker testimony is is that we can do that and more to say I've been to die to join the number again Barry

your working at a radio station ... always kind of keep your eye out for potential talent\nI'm In and my goodness we have a boatload of it here in the river region but uh I have listen now to talk radio for years I mean\nGas twenty plus years I mean I was I was listening to talk radio when I was younger uh certainly by the time I went to college or listen to it on a regular basis even in Auburn which had terrible talk radio terrible talk radio I mean all they had were national shows and in a couple of quirky little\nOut of quirky little shows didn't have any substantive shows\nAnd local shows but uh but look I I I listened to listen and I've listened a I'd lived in multiple states South Florida and listen to talk radio down there and listen to talk radio in Pennsylvania Indiana when I Lived there ... ... ... ... especially for our market size but ... the best talk radio callers and listening audience\nThat I've ever run across part of that uh that really needs to the credit needs

the news and I forget the people holding a Boulder debt to seven to nine two to eight or we're obviously a updating you on what's going on hurricane Michael is still appears to be an hour or more off the coast of Florida\nUm it's it's a it's it's substantial though it's substantial right now the the windows they have right now Appalachian coal uh getting up in the mid sixties now sixty three miles an hour or\nThe other areas of Florida the vacation areas you're probably familiar with Panama City in and those are in a forty five mile an hour range still not enough to do damage to the structures down there a mobile home it looks to me mobile homes I think will be total losses at dinner in the past this destined thirty nine miles an hour at school just thirty six I mean these are punished or but\nUm it looks to me like it's going farther east\nThen maybe it was initially tracked which I think would be good for the state of Alabama obviously you don't want to steer a hurricane into\nHelpless people in other areas of the country I mean you know somebody's going to get hit by this thing I'm always I'm always amused by people who pray a hurricane doesn't hit them\nYou you need to pray there again we can ... you don't just bring it moves off your property because that just means you know hit somebody else's property\nOr let's not let's not pray that got harms other people

but man people\nPatients trip uh who's this\nCooper Cooper when I'm In ... are great guys were okay and I'm hoping he can chew up a little bit okay I keep hearing that are on the national media that we're all spread out\nThe White House the house of representatives house represented and I'm going to lose depressed\nWell but it's the same thing but you know the drumbeat that college educated suburban women are going to burn out on Monday percent Democrat\nOkay that's not going to have I Can't believe that no it's not going to happen um [noise] All right let's you know dirty little secret here [noise]\nThe media doesn't like you and the media doesn't want to hear about that yeah I'm I'm positive about you you are white redneck in Alabama nobody on any national television show gives a damn about you or me or anybody else in this area [noise] um\n[noise] here's what they're discounting here here's what I think the massive discounting is [noise] uh yes it's not we're probably not going to pick up seats in the house and we may even lose some seats in some of these border areas that wouldn't be unheard of but I think the redistricting efforts in twenty ten were so overwhelmingly partisan\nAnd that's fine the Democrats do when they're in charge we might as well do were in charge you know why are we the only ones that ever tried to be fair [noise]\nUm but the the Democrats do it when they're in charge and and twenty ten\nFrom the redistricting effort in state legislatures all over the country [noise] were for the first time led by a majority of Republicans and it's led to the fact that in multiple consecutive elections Democrats have actually gotten more votes than Republicans\nYet we have maintained massive leads\nThe house of representatives massive majorities in the in the United States House of representatives and the reason for that is because we drew the line we drew the line\nWe stack them impact them they say we stacked in packed liberals in the same districts\nSo I I wouldn't worry about it being the total obliteration I mean look look they they spent fifty million dollars on jak Ossoff over in Atlanta I couldn't get him over the edge of a guy in Montana body slammed a reporter the day before the election and he won\nAnd they'll do anything they can you know these polls I I've been in the polling business now for several years are both commissioning polls and then even doing some of the interpretation and uh and and questioned drawing up myself over the years um\nThere's really like a I mean you can do it with a straight face and honesty and and not be called at the national media you can really move a poll about four or five points it that's what I that's kind of the outer limits of what you're able to do with the math\nSo you get your Raul numbers back assuming you've got to balance and you've had all your demos you get your all numbers back and then you begin to make up a set of assumptions that sound polling with thanks for your call ... ... you began to make a set of assumptions about\nWhat the electorate is going to look like and and past performance is the best indicator of future performance\nOr that's just that's that's that's\nWhat they say on all the financial stuff because it's reality I mean you want to know if somebody's a\nGoing to be a a relapse drug addict well did they clean up and stay

the catering manager about um about a firing up some catering over there at MIT temp H kitchen ... twenty seven minutes after ten o'clock [noise]\nI'm All right I'm gonna I'm gonna switch away for just a moment I don't know where ... ... ... like I don't know where it got so sidetracked on at a polling discussion moments ago a Chuck Grassley made an interesting comment yesterday\nA cocaine Mitch Mitch McConnell\n[noise] uh has basically been a hero one of the the as jak pointed out yesterday one of the heroes of this um\nSupreme Court fight cocaine Mitch could've folded and said hey I'm we're not going to we're not going to push this Kevin all through but a lot of allegations he could he said you know we were worried about keeping women in the ... the mentor I think he sensed that women knew this was garbage\nI think he sensed it anyway he pushed forward and now we have Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh yesterday on the court in a robe sitting on the far right hand side as you face the court or listening to oral arguments and I think petitioning that they're going to read argue a couple of the cases that were hurt the first week\nYou know the liberals tried to hold them out so they wouldn't be able to hear those cases I think they're going to re hear some of those cases believe it or not [noise]\nUm but you guys remember why we got Neil Gorsuch in the first place Justice Antonin Scalia died about nine months before the election there six months before the election whenever it was two months before the elections\nOr in twenty sixteen and cocaine Mitch said we're not going to have a a we're not going to have a hearing we're not going to hold a hearing on nominee Merrick Garland\n\nBrock Obama nominee Merrick Garland he said no not when there's an election we're not going to hold a hearing and Chuck Grassley said we're not going to hold a hearing in the in the committee the Judiciary Committee than we know hearing unmarried Garland and cocaine mentioned Chuck Grassley got their way\nWell\nTo be fair one of the reporters asked what if Donald Trump is up for election and twenty twenty now cooking Mitch could've said and and Chuck Grassley could've said well there's different because he's an incumbent and he's running again for reelection\nAnd so that's a different scenario than a lame duck Obama while there is an election going on that's a totally different scenario that's how I Would have answered it a cocaine Mitch duck the question\nBut Chuck Grassley took the bait and said listen I had a farm rule no nominees in an election year and I mean it\nOr retires I Am not going to hold a hearing in twenty twenty and the Judiciary Committee\nAnd at first I heard that and I thought what the hell's gotten into Chuck Grassley he saw it as a rock normally Chuck Grassley is one of the great United States centers and he proved himself ... er during the hearings on break Kevin think and it came to the same thing Mitch McConnell did the same thing he said hey\nWe're gonna push 'em through you know whatever it's like he was on something like okay no sound on his father in law's boat you know he he was he had some fortitude and some some energy [noise]\nWell there's a little back story did this in all likelihood Chuck Grassley will not be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and twenty twenty [noise] chairman Grassley is looking to move over to a different committee\nAnd twenty twenty the chair different committed then I can let the same person care to to massive committees like this [noise] um [noise] and so the odds are he will not be there\nAnd twenty twenty he's looking ahead to the Finance Committee next year and if that happens the Judiciary Committee unless he gets off of the Judiciary Committee likely will fall to you guys want to know who likely will be the one shepherding through the next guy\n\nHe'll he'll appreciate it you'll be happy you wouldn't have been happy a month ago\nWhich will be happy now because a month ago I don't and I still don't know that I trust this guy but he did prove himself at least once I don't have a history he kind of history of being a ... like it's not just like obviously but it is his friend Lindsey Graham\nWho is the heir apparent the successor of parents have Chuck Grassley on the Judiciary Committee and I can't see if Lindsey Graham thinks he might care that committee I cannot see him getting off that committee [noise]\nSo I think if if all holds true Lindsey Graham will be the one gambling through and you're twenty twenty of somebody passes away retires now it's not likely nice it's it's a it's a low likelihood that scenario happens\nTwenty twenty is a a few years off of course the notorious RPG Darth Vader Ginsburg she is\nA threat to die and he met it I mean and and every day that goes by she's more likely to die or did you see the picture of her at the swearing in for Brett Kavanaugh\nTo begin with what's what the gloves is this something people do I I'm not saying this is this something elderly women do they wear gloves in public I think elderly women all the time church the store you know\nI never see them and gloves what the hell's with the gloves she ... she hiding something as she's slumped over like Stephen Hawking\nWho by the way is dead\nAnd died of a horrific painful a lifelong debilitating\nAnd that's what she looks like\nAnd I don't think she has that lifelong debilitating illness and say you wouldn't wish that on your worst enemy is terrible but that's what she looks like he's all slumped over in her chair and fact\nI I'm guessing the artist ... to deter a favor because he's sort of cartoons Brett Kavanaugh a little bit they need to look into the artist is that the Supreme Court but the one of these news organizations had an artist or the news or or or the Supreme Court itself had an artist and you know they don't allow cameras in the courtroom so to get a visual\nFeeling of the courtroom and this happens all over the country a lot of lot of places like that but to get a feeling of what's going on in the courtroom what it looks like they'll have an artist a chalk hardest get in there and and sketch out real quickly uh\nDidn't want it to look like chaos was was taking place didn't want to damage anyway so they like Kavanaugh get through they let him get seated they let him get sworn in they let him get on the bench boom now let's announce it and and there are a lot of media people who are are upset you can tell in their reporting [noise]\nAnd that they were upset here's how the Washington Post that the two are obviously eager to downplay the idea that this was hasty but if it wasn't that might make the timing even odd or if this was planned it was apparently one of the best kept secrets and a very leaky White House the news reportedly blindsided\nThose in the foreign policy establishment the White House and even members of Haley's on staff Haley's exodus do at the end of the year which may still be around for as many as twelve more weeks but see in the White House chose to announce has announced his four weeks before the twenty Eighteen election\nThey're they're trying to figure out how this happened in trying to wink and nod oh I got another story about the Washington Post I Want to give you a little bit\nBut they're trying to link and not that there's more to this then it wasn't what Nikki Haley and Donald Trump said in the oval office it wasn't on the up and up that there's bad blood they're trying to end is when the reality is I don't think there was\nI think Nikki Haley was the right person for that posted the right time and now she's ready to move on\nWhether or not that was the agreement from the beginning or she's just come to that realization that's fine but once she comes to that realization is seen Donald Trump talk about it and he needs to now go out and interview other people into FBI background checks on other people and and so forth and so on it's going to leak out that she's leaving and so even though it's four weeks before election\nIt was the time to announce it but they did it on their own terms they did on her and her and I don't think there's anything more to it than that I Know even people in the conservative writers at all there's got to be more ...\nThere is I Know she's an establishment list but you know what that's who you needed to I Know the person he's looking at the replays there is a Goldman Sachs woman ... I did that\nBut you know what it is a globalized institution as long as remember of it you gotta kinda play by those when she got to kind of play by those rules I mean you're you're you're dealing necessarily with globalism at the un I don't like it any more than you to keep our friend rooster cupboards\nBut the but this reality\nReality\nSo anyway or number two seven to nine two to eight if you want to get into seven to nine to two here's this hey there had to I thought it was Kim Williams in Alabama homeowner Terry\nI'm doing great how can you take a call I could only take your calls

James Baker goes saying all those things yeah those are opinion things those are things that can never be proven\nIncorrect those that they can't that's not a perjury trap you can't go in and and and start saying well your opinion was wrong that's perjury he's saying in his opinion those were legitimate threats from Rosenstein that was a legitimate plan to try to undermine and take out the front of the United states\nAs bad as what his position was that changed bakers position now keep in mind James Baker is on the hook\nWith people like Andrew McCabe and James Comey and Bruce or invaders stroke and Lisa ... all under investigation change maker may very well be under that same investigation he may very well be headed to prison with James Comey and Andrew McCabe and Peter stroke and Lisa Page and Bruce or in LA or\nAnd John Carlin and Mary McCord in my court and the genes I became more I mean this this is this small group that put this thing together\nThey'll be lucky if the only thing they get his prison they'll be lucky\nIf you if you attempt a coup in most countries and get caught he don't go to prison you go to the gallows\nOriented lined up and shot and killed after the verdict comes down\nIf there's a verdict at all [noise]\nSo it's that's what they're facing and that's the New York times or using as an outlet when you read stories in the New York times or you hear\nTestimony from one of these people in this small group understand their motive why are they trying to throw Rod Rosenstein under the bus I've taken a lot of backlash from you people including my own mother tax me every time I bring it up and did it again this morning\nOf humor\nEvery time I bring it up that Rod Rosenstein is a bad guy and to get off this idea that he's at worst a gray hat and at best a white hat because he's very well may be a black cat ... I'll I'll give you that'll give you that possibility there's a possibility he's a black and he's a bad actor I'll give you that\nI'm not seeing evidence of it I don't see the evidence of it\nThey only they only rhetoric I say about it is coming from people who have nothing to lose and everything to gain by throwing Rod Rosenstein under the bus\nAnd I go back to that\nThe key piece of evidence he's still employed so is his boss Jeff Sessions who want it in there to begin with\nAnd so I'm not getting off my theory that this is all a show\nI'm not you know getting off my theory that somehow Rod Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions have pulled off one of the greatest psychological operations ever unleashed on the United states I'm not getting off of that yet\nI'm not getting off the fact is sleeping Jennifer pointed humor the the ... the U.S attorney from Utah to follow the department of justice inspector general Horwitz\nAnd make sure that these people were prosecuted as he was uncovering wrongdoing I'm not getting off of that theory it and I'm not getting off the theory that Jeff Sessions is doing his job sleep a labor doing his job behind closed doors not talking about it\nAnd trying to make sure there's no leaks these are things I'm unwilling to compromise on why because the only things that make sense if Rod Rosenstein is a bad guy wise became against him why are they planning stories of your time while they have James Baker going up they're throwing them under the bus\nJames Baker is not a good guy there's like there's not one of us he's got to be not America Toronto American why is he why is he doing that\nAnd again why is the New York times reporting bad things about Rosenstein\nBecause if frozen signs of bad actor who does that alleviate pressure from\nMcCain\nMcCain McCain out of all these people as the most likely to go to prison\nOut of all of the people are calling me out of McCain out of right Becky banker page stroke\nOr either or either or nearly or or Bruce or Sally Yates\nMy core ten out of all these people frankly priest that\nBill priest it but I Do all these people Andrew McCabe is the most likely to do time in prison [noise]\nBecause he is already had a criminal referral from the department of justice inspector general to the Federal Bureau of investigation or the Federal Bureau of matters as it was under\nBronco bombing Loretta Lynch\nHe's the most likely to go to prison and if that's the case he has the greatest incentive to work with the New York times with a Rod Rosenstein on the bus and one of the New York times incentive\n\nYou can get in touch with people and have them lead them a stray and imagine if you're the FBI setting them up on the other side holy mackerel that's like the [noise] and that's what was going on before Rod Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions were sworn into office\nThat was being led by Andrew McCabe and James Comey that was being land out of\nWing of the FBI\nThat's what was happening Andrew McCabe and James Comey the director and the deputy director the FBI were leading this operation\nAnd Jeff Sessions was just a senator from Alabama who was a surrogate going around talking on behalf of the Trump Administration from dimetapp and Rod Rosenstein was just a career professional plodding along\nIt wasn't in on a small group I've given you the name several times a day of the people who were really in on a small group FBI special agents Lisa pay a painter stroke and if an FBI lawyer Lisa Page\nThe OJ official Bruce or in his wife Nelly ... James Baker the chief of staff\nYou got a lot of these people that were the head of these divisions Mary McCord and James car or a John Carlin\nYou have a lot of these people who were in on it [noise] on the FBI side and a few on the D. O. J. side to the national security division\nAnd I'm just going to say for the sake of argument that Rod Rosenstein was not in on it ahead of time [noise]\nSo let's make a demarcation point January twenty two thousand Seventeen noon if Donald Trump takes office\nAnd a lot of those people are still in place while Donald Trump is president United States Jeff Sessions won't be sworn in for\nA few more weeks a couple of months actually baby a month but that I have um\nRod Rosenstein will be sworn until after that so you have the enemy who was working to defeat choose working to monitor you now running free inside the very departments you're about to take over\nJeff Sessions gets sworn in Rod Rosenstein gets sworn in and out their job is to figure out\nHow did they wrest control of the department of justice away from these people meanwhile there are very legitimate operations going on drug dealers terrorism\nThings that go on at the FBI and the department of justice investigate and you can't just stop everything fire everybody well you could have been some days I feel like they should but see but but what I understand they're thinking you come in as February twenty Seventeen President Trump's New York shut down the FBI is your first official act of office [noise] that might raise a few eyebrows\nEspecially when it when things are under investigation but you have to figure out how do we continue the operations that are legitimate and investigate the operations that are illegitimate\nWell as the other side knows you're investigating them they change their behaviors so one way you could do that is to sort of go along with that it's happening anyway\nBy virtue of your position you're going to have to sign some documents from time to time\nOne way to go along with it to continue to investigate it is to go along with that design those documents if you don't sign if someone is in a moment you refused to sign it in your tip everybody off the ... year on the other side and they start changing their behavior and they start going after you keep your mind is a pretty fancy and powerful tools in our intelligence community\n[noise]\nYou don't necessarily want them after you remembered Chuck Schumer is warning they got six ways from Sunday you get back at you\nSee this is not the people you want to piss off until you got full control over the organization\nI think that's what Rod Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions found themselves when they got into office I really did [noise]\nI don't buy the Patsy argument necessarily I I think that's the word that's where I go to great ... that's the worst case scenario is that Rod Rosenstein of twenty plus year veteran of the department of justice rising to the absolute pinnacle of as a part of his position there's only one physician\nAhead of him [noise] Rod Rosenstein\nI don't think is an idiot I think he's probably quite brilliant\nAnd I don't think he walked into a situation where he's just a dumb idiot you know there will pass a bill to the to do [laughter] I don't think the Trump people think that I think they're putting out that message through their friendly channels to try to get people off the case but I don't think Rod Rosenstein Japan see at all\nNor do I think he was a willing participant in the effort to undermine the Trump Administration he wasn't there\nUntil after January twenty until Trump was an officer the two phases of this there's an early phase and the light face the early phase Rosenstein wasn't even there that was candidate Trump they were going\nAfter and then eventually president elect Trump Rosenstein is not there is not in a small group it gets in the small group by virtue of his appointment to the be all the bosses basically\nFrom the the OJ side and the the OJ runs that the ... runs the FBI I mean that's something people lose track of their cross the street which are you going to Washington DC ones on the right inside ones on the left hand side of the avenue running right down the middle of it\nBut if you put yourself in Rosenstein ascension shoes he wants to investigate this because you're loyal to the Trump Administration you want to ferret out corruption inside the department of justice and the FBI but you just got there\nAnd there's this whole snazzy operation that you don't even know how deep it went and who all was involved and you don't know who up there you can trust you got to investigate this how do you do it you do it from the inside you do it from the inside you say things like\nYou know guys we are taped this guy take them out [noise]\nThat's what we ought to do to get his cabinet officials to invoke twenty fishermen take 'em out sessions on boy he'll do that but we can get Ben Carson he said some nasty things about Carson along the way Rick Perry that that we could I bet we could pull these guys alone\nBritish she's one of us [noise]\nAnd you figure out who's on your team and who's not\nI Can't think of a better way to to you don't go into these organizations with a wrecking ball started knocking down walls doesn't work that way the world doesn't work that way\nAnd if you did it he would be found out they would fill up and play them up investigations go nowhere Trump would be in office eight years and then and then life goes on in the right back to the same shenanigans and they're still there for the twenty twenty campaign doing what they were doing they have access to all the same database is\nYou know the Pfizer want wasn't what gave them access to the Trump Administration they already had access that's what people don't understand that's what gets lost in the federal government has access to spy on all your electronic communications every step of the way every day anytime they want\nThe only thing stopping them from doing it is they don't know who you are and they don't give a damn about you your two smaller potatoes otherwise they could sit there and turn the camera on your phone and why don't you take a dump\nOtherwise they can watch what you're watching on your computers at home and what your streaming on Netflix\nAnd what channels you watch it on TV what emails you're receiving in from home or you corresponding with by text and phone that I mean the only thing stopping them as they don't know who you are and they don't care about the three hundred thirty million other people and presumably some of those resources are going to try to head off crimes\nBut they can spy on the Trump Administration to conspire in the Trump campaign anytime they want it to the only thing stopping them what was that it was illegal and you think people who are trying to enact a coup give a damn about legality the fires of warning wasn't what gave them access to the Trump campaign it's what made their access legal that they already had to the Trump campaign\nThey were already looking at all that information and McCabe knows it\nAnd Coney knows it and James Baker knows it and Lisa Page does it and Peter stroke knows it and they all know it that's the only thing that kept them from bringing out publicly they had to had to find them once a legitimate\nAnd think Bruce or in Delhi or who concocted their steamed accomplished would they accomplish anything they gave a damn about legality\nNo there was a time when liberals would be on my side in this argument there was a time when honest liberals in this country would listen to what I'm saying and say yes that's too much power for the federal government's secret organization that has no\nNo civilian oversight no congressional oversight because all they have to do is play national security and Congress can't even asking what they're working on\n[laughter] that's too much power nobody should be able to watch my cameras in my computer's\nNobody should be able to read my text messages and listen to my phone calls not only listen to all this stuff story at all in a central database and access at anytime they want it to that too much power from one federal government that's too much power for any federal agency liberals would have agreed with me you know when three years ago before the election of Donald J truck\nBut they hate him so badly\nSpent all pretenses of objectivity go out the window when Donald Trump's name comes up\nAll\nGoodness meals to go grab and go proteins housemates sauces you'll be the hero at your

at Halloween that time the the L Word out and collect\nAll also be talking\nAbout some news the trailer park and the home and send them around the featuring skyscraper but first if you want to get in touch with me you can email me back guys that that guy at the movie dot com really male voice mail at some point zero two oh five six four five six seven four zero two oh five six or five six even find me on the Internet at\nThat guy that the movie dot com or dot com slash back I at the movies you want to reach out to me on Twitter I'm at ... dot com slash Kevin car\n... this is what's happening in your world\nOnly a couple of pieces of news that I really wanted to focus on this week in the first one is about James Gunn now of course if you remember earlier this year he was on ceremony asleep fired by Disney as the director of guardians of the galaxy three even though he'd already worked on a script and they were in pre production and\nIt was because of these tweets and they were offensive tweets but they were twin city stand out as as a you know there were bad taste jokes but they were jokes they were not real tweaks of real things he did and it was kind of a hit these because this was\nPicked up by like a conservative blogger who was I think he was angry at the fact that James Gunn was very\nCritical of President Trump and his policies and and that's his own right to do that but this guy them kind of created this outrage out of nowhere and had people say oh how are you oh you know making the desired this guy because he drunk you know moving for kids talking raccoon in a tree and isn't this terrible at your wedding this person make jokes about pedophilia and rape and\nYou're going to keep him on the project and people overreacted people went after\nHim and then just the major fired him which I thought was a huge mistake by Disney mainly because this was behavior that took place almost ten years ago before he was even affiliated with Disney he has not done it since it's not something he was doing like this weekend it was something he had done in the past\nAnd he has grown as a director and he had apologized or to me and actually brought it up back\nWhen he was hired for guardians of the galaxy one what five six years ago\nBut because we live in an outrage culture where everybody wants to knee jerk and get offended at everything people are weaponize outrage is that's not a good thing I feel for James Gunn I don't think he should have been fired for that yes it was in bad taste but he apologized any change in behavior it's not like he\nDenied it and deleted it and then said that didn't exist he acknowledges he owned up to the changes behavior and he's not doing that anymore\nAnd it was just jokes in the first place I visited the industry that let Mike Tyson star movies they convicted rapist yet James Gunn who make some bad patient and yes they are in bad taste\nAnd I was hoping that Disney would quietly re hire him but I think a lot of eyes are on him and I think they're waiting for a little bit to try and do that but they may not have a chance because rumor has it that your brother's\nIs eyeing James Gunn to write and direct suicide squad to now if you remember suicide squad was Warner brothers' film about these economic anti heroes people like\nEvery year thousands of kids go here can be current mommy I Can't ... until\nNot even an army middle terrain terms on record reverse perjuring preparing an unfamiliar Carol\nCan learn more about the social promotion them how to fish or how dark tobacco\n[noise]\nAnd\nWelcome back to back guys at the movies with Kevin car let's jump into the movie reviews with our first movie in the first man I'm going to start off by reviewing it\nBut they want to address the controversy that came earlier this year and I I didn't carry the lead very well with my complaint already last segment but you'll understand why they destroyed the controversy and this goes back to sort of the weaponized the outrage\nFor dumb reasons but anyway let's talk about the movie first let's get that out of the way because I think let's talk about the movie as clean as possible and that is the first man Oscar winning director Damien ... takes us very intimate look at a Neil Armstrong ... man\nWe've chosen a job so difficult\nRequiring so many technological development\nWe're going to have to start from scratch\nNeal flight is down in history [noise]\nWhat kind of dog do you have about that are planning on the flight being successful\nIn the world\nThe ... I thought that whiplash was a fine movie I didn't think it was the greatest movie ever I thought that the J. case them and certainly deserves Oscar for it but they're the movie itself wasn't the greatest movie ever although I Know some people who think it was the same thing with la la la la la land had its moments I thought la la land was fine\nBut it's certainly absolutely was not the best to hear it absolutely was not the best to be here and certainly wasn't the best directing of the year I'm Emma Stone is quite good in that Ryan Gosling was fine but the the God da\nAction to la la land was overblown in my opinion\nSo first man I I'm not coming at it saying oh I Love his director I Can't wait to see what he does max I kinda was trepidation about seeing this film because I think the kind of guy who can get over blown and over rated very very fast these sort of like a more intimate version of Christopher Nolan\nWho has a couple of good films but some very mediocre and some kind of terrible films as well\nI'm not Neil Armstrong's biographer so I Do not know how accurate justice but the one thing I really appreciate it about how they made this movie\nIs they approach it differently than everything else if you want the right stuff go watch the right stuff if you want Apollo Thirteen go watch Apollo Thirteen there is no shortage of space race movies there's no shortage of astronauts as heroes\nAnd want the shots of them walking in slow motion down the tarmac you're going to get that and other movies you don't need that here\nThat's not the purpose of this movie\nThis movie is not to give you a hero shots not to say that they're not heroes yes they're heroes and all but the point is this is not fantasizing astronauts it's showing a very visceral look at what it was like to be one\nNow down in the Kennedy Space center down in Florida where I've been I've set inside a replica of the Gemini probe I've sat inside a ... a barely fit into a mercury\nCapsule and the Apollo lunar module those things are tiny and they look like tin cans and they look like you're inside of an old fashioned radio\nThey do not look like spaceships they looked terrifyingly complex but ready to break any minute and they are very very cramped and the windows aren't very big most of the space shots in this movie and here's where the strength to strength of this movie are when they're doing the NASA stuff when they're doing the space\nOr in the travel and the waiting and and the checking and and the adapting that's the great stuff\nAnd what they do they put you in right there with Armstrong or anybody else\nMay only way to make this any more intimate into Armstrong is to physically have put the camera inside Ryan Gosling face\nBecause he's in there all the time and and all of the space shuttle shirt and the cats with them so you see it shaking you hear the rumbling and you see those lights flashing and how confusing you can be and how cramped it is and how you have just as tiny little window the size of like a legal pad [noise]\nYeah they have a couple of shots or to the grand trucks especially when the Saturn fives going up there at the Apollo Thirteen type shot of you know ... ... rockets Judy off enough exhaust and all that kind of some yeah you have a couple of those shots\nBut by and large this is not shot like a Michael Bay beer commercial it's shot and mostly in the cockpit and the cabin of these things in the models themselves\nBecause that's what the astronaut saw and experienced and that's the value of this movie because you get a chance to almost experience what it was like I I've not been a big fan of those like like states that move kinds of sentiments but I think this would be an easy one to be in to watch that way\nSo in the in the moment and and and that's the best part of it and they're also seeing them kind of going through the gritty ugly on appealing elements of training which you always don't see it is it's sort of even in like the right stuff it was sort of wins like all the way they put it together\nNow the rest of the film and this is what kind of bloated and do to our twenty minute running time is the home stuff and the emotional stuff with the wife and the kids [noise]\nUnfortunately when you come to the space race movies you have the experience of the wives because it was a sexist nation certainly back in the sixties and the fifties women weren't allowed in capitals they weren't going to send a woman into space back then\nBecause that's the way the world was so the only job a woman had assigned from a movie like hidden figures where you could take the human computers and make a film out of them you know and even then that was extremely sexist\nAttitudes that that toppled those women back in the sixties and fifties movie like this\nAll you can do is have the wife kinda wringing our hands are not a whole lot for her to do because there wasn't a whole lot for the wives to do it all\nAnd clear for you is good and she acts and she's fine in the movie but there's not much for her to do\nAnd they they have to give her due diligence so that's I think what blows to the movie and makes it a little boring a lot in the end for personal family stuff\nI mean that that that border lines on just sort of like the misery for and I was talking about with with the stars born last year of you know fighting and him not wanting to deal with it but it does show the real pragmatic dangers in the real dangers\nAnd problems that they were facing and even just public relation problems that they were facing back in the sixties\nSo overall I'm going to stay to the movie it kind of rocks cat Iraq [noise]\nNow onto the giant controversy that came out earlier this year the facts that they didn't have the planting of the American flag on them and\nAgain that's not what the movie's about true they do not have that scene\nBut if you're looking for American flags you're gonna find them everywhere in this movie there on uniforms they're on spacesuits there on the side of rocket ships they're behind astronauts during a press conference there's even a scene of Neil Armstrong some raising the flag and there's a shot of the flag on the moon\nWhat you don't have any you don't have them coming down and planting a flag with a choir behind them thinking God Bless America because that's not what the movies about\nThe movie is not about fantasizing the hero worship of the space race the movies about what it was like to be there when you went through to get there and the danger that you are facing and the uncertainty and the claustrophobia and then the best isolation the infidels once you get there spoiler alert they make it to the moon and so when you get to the moon it's vast\nAnd its Iceland and the only person for what hundreds of thousands of miles so again this was manufactured fake outrage and the fact that they didn't have this big heroic moments that wouldn't belong in this movie would have been so out of place again it's not a Michael Bay beer commercial\nSo don't start criticizing movies if you haven't seen them go see the freaking movie and then criticize it as you want to they mentioned those you know not a big fan of him he didn't certainly seem rightfully so God is Mac ... people were complaining about this because he said that some of the movies about in\nThe blanks dial back your rental outrage meters and the joy of piece of art as a piece of art and understand where the directors coming from don't just bang your chest out of patriotism so yeah go the first man but don't look for this so do the trigger moment just snowflakes\nI Need to go to a break when it comes back I'm going to talk about goose bumps two hundred

I ... I was having a very hard time title and yet and so I had a lot of help with that\nFair enough I Know that that the titles and all of them have subtitles as especially when you're dealing with a non fiction with to this this is not yet I'm are often are down to a publisher is as opposed to the the athletes themselves\nBut a ... conversation yeah I I Know back and forth email trillions of meetings coffee tree et cetera [laughter] tell us how how this novel um demonstrates\nSo oh well I mean like it absolutely a thing it seems so cliche but like April and this book um I think see herself as an antidote to fear like she her whole like her great fear is that like everyone and her society is going to succumb to fear\nAnd that is going to make us more lonely more insular and more suspicious and and that it will like ... to really be our do like that as her grave fear and and she sees herself as like I could be a human I can be a face to to this thing that is happening to our world\nI can be you know like I'm ... I'm young I'm small and I'm not afraid so why what's so maybe we maybe you should question your own fear\nAnd I think that that like that is sort of one of the most respectable things one of the things that I like most about April with that she takes that responsibility so seriously that also we've heard about the decisions and I think probably she takes it makes you made it cuts a little bit too much responsibility on herself\nBut um but yeah I I think that we really do have to confront fear right now\nIn a way that um ... maybe maybe we always have had to because like it is a very dangerous thing and I think that it has been very isolating and it has created a lot of loneliness and our society and it is also very easy to sell Adams and that that's something I think we need to confront\nI I tend to think that when we look at the mass movements of populism\nCollege now instead of ... tuna for peace of mind movies say the system will be reliable and ready when the cold

point one [noise]\nListening to now it's the News I'm Derek layer and we're speaking with blogger and author Hank Green knowing that you're likely correct in your\nGuess that it is going to get worse before it gets better makes me want to retreat into my my monastery and right on my part Trent\nUm it was was that your writing process I mean how I guess my question is how digital or is your process and how much do you kind of everything else off\nAs you write or is it more of an interactive I'm looking at things on line I'm I'm searching up quotes and things like that things like that because I I Know that has changed a lot over the last Twenty years or so yeah\nI definitely have to to do both and so I have periods of time where I'm writing but also like I Am aware that the thing that I'm reading it's going to require research so it's like it's got a setting that I'm not familiar with or it's like a profession I'm not familiar with\nUm and so like there are times that I'm writing and constantly back and forth between Google Maps are like ... an airplane or whatever and\nThere are times when I the software I ride and lets me black everything else out and I just see a copy of tax that looks like a you know the pages in a book and that's more like for writing dialogue for writing seems between characters or\nOr for reading things that I already know about and I'm familiar with because that's like my expertise as being a a person who has dealt with and watched a lot of people go through the dramatic throes of being famous on the Internet\nSpeaking with bank green is the author of the debut novel an absolutely remarkable thing it is an interesting process and what you go through as a writer it's an interesting process what we're likely to go through as a society and I I\nAm wondering what you think that will be goodness knows how long it's going to take\nOn the other side because as I I really do believe because I I Am a a digital immigrant as as many folks my age are and ah and my daughter is is a digital native and I see ... many wonderful things like you guys that that are out there that she watches\nAnd they also see lots of nonsensical things that really maybe we'll make sense to me in another uh ten years or maybe it to her will will not make sense and another ten years so you know only only time can del but what do you think on the other side of\nThis reckoning if this is a shift akin to the transition between schools and the printing press which which by the way I think perhaps\nMaybe this is only from the remove the history was easier to identify because you can see the technology in a way that like what we're doing seems more subtle or at least that that the shape of the mind\nThat that it has an impact on seems more subtle to me but that again that may just be because\nThis is what I'm going through ... through now yeah what do you think it looks like on the side what what does the golden age of the Internet the golden age on the Internet looked like to you\nIt looks more like background it looks more like this is the thing that we use and we in the same way that like a book his background and ended is just another\nAnother piece of media among all the other media people have always been like so when's he gonna kill TV and I'm like obviously but TV is alive and well let's just come through Netflix now by TV as a thing it's just maybe I'm through a different type\nAnd I and books are still a thing and plays are still a thing and storytelling is still a thing it's all still things we just have new ones\nI think that like there are there are possible outcomes that I'm more afraid of that have to do with\nThese platforms having intentional effects on people and saying like well wouldn't everyone spent more time and more money here if they were happy and so we will make them happy and people will come back to the platform because the platforms are making them happy\nAnd been providing them some kind of fulfillment\nAnd making them feel valued and like that level of control over a a populous is pretty scary for a private company to have you know that's something that I'm a little bit afraid of a ... and that sort of like a ten to twenty year term fear of mine\nAnd then and then I think like probably what a lot of this looks like his we build up structures to allow us to not get addicted to that is\nThe way that ... many of us are addicted to it right now and we find that there that we have a little bit of a rebellion against it and then we and then like\nAnd which we've already seen some forms of but like a bigger form of that where people are like we're going to trash that's in like it's not a thing and I don't like it anymore and so there is a there is a movement against and then that leads to it becoming like finding its place as a part but\nMuch less of an integral part of of our society where you know I I hopefully that means creating more physical spaces and people realizing that the loss that they have undergone and not having those things\nAnd that when and that not everybody like I think that it's like every individual they're going to choose different paths\nBut there's going to be I think I Hope a push toward more\nA more interaction in by so called third spaces like coffee shops in bars and [noise] and universities and and ... and libraries and bookstores also probably uh where people are are finding places to a ... exist\nTogether and ah and and have more\nYou know more natural human communication\nThat as a thoughtful complicated nuanced and if I had to guess very all very hopeful and and I hope accurate response\nUm and it nevertheless makes me want to retreat to the models to monasteries the end of the the the twentieth century and\nAnd and let my daughter who exposed me to you first with the consequences or or just transport me thirty or fifty years in into the future once it's all what's the dust has settled\nA but I suppose we all live through periods of of transition and you're part of the positive change and I thank you for that you really have have created something positive and wonderful here [laughter] and

taking a peak and trying to be losing creative because that's not my time for being with some creative it's my time for being really focused analytical\nGot to be speaking with Daniel Pink he's the author when the scientific secrets a perfect timing\nAnother instance of what it seems to be very bad timing in our society that comes up again and again in the news is school schedules for high school students it seems like a report after report says\nYou know it's just not good for students who teenagers biologically to a wake up early in the morning\nAnd expect to have their brains optimally focused and that we should push schools there are times back an hour or two but we have this tremendous social pressure and tremendous social structure built around\nGetting up in the morning and everything having to do with childcare and uh uh don't work schedules seeming to push back against that how do we bridge that gap\nYeah or maybe you you have a spot on at this that is not even a close call you have the ... so what does the scientific background very briefly is this that all of us have different chronic types of their mentioned early riser really go to sleep early\nRise late go to sleep late and most of us are actually in the middle but uh they're they're they're big\nAffects the age so between the ages of what fourteen and twenty four people end up being moving significantly toward late this I've become much more how like I Know you do with being ... and my father a Fifteen year old has nothing to do with being lazy it has everything to do with being Fifteen\nAnd um and so as a result of this the American Academy of pediatrics a\nHas urged schools\nDo not start school\nFor teenagers before eight thirty in the morning and yet\nIn the face of all this evidence school start times\nRemain the average is in America is about eight or three I Am a and\nIt just it it it just doesn't make any sense and I think that you got it right there on on the reasons why it's essentially inconvenient for adults it's inconvenient for adults and we're not talking starting school at two in the afternoon we're talking about pushing by this will start to nine nine Fifteen and the school districts that have done this has seen pretty impressive results lower drop out rate higher test scores\nReduced the incidence of of depression and obesity even decline in teenage car accidents\nAnd it's also pretty cost effective solution any yet it somewhat inconvenience for adults because they might not be able to\nDrop their kids off at school when they want to it's sometimes inconvenient for letting coaches who say oh wait a second we need to have hours and hours and hours were letting practice this has caused an early [noise] um but\nYou know I you know it to me the idea that the American Academy of pediatrics is sort of a generic kind of sounding entity but just think of it as all the pediatricians in America linking arms\nAnd saying please school districts don't do this and yet to many of them are the ones who have changed have have done some great work but somehow this is a stubborn a persistent problem\nWell as the father of two teenagers I'm hoping that it's something that we can manage as a society to overcome because I have been in the trenches and I see the effects first hand and that really is critical as are so many aspects in in

research\nAnd you were a thorough and exhaustive when you're looking into something uh went to the White House to hand in his resignation yes some Trump declined he would accept that one is the back story behind that I mean clearly\nKnowing what we know mhm\nTrump would have been perfectly within his rights to stick to show up possess it let's say you're fired truth\nSo it sounds to me like the president is\nA step ahead on this one [noise] and his plane in to some extent what do you think\nI think so you know everybody says Trump will Trump first off Trump's like he's like when a he's a

the perfect position when the bigger rest come that's kind of how she was saying that is what cue says it's happening and um it is it's hoped porn it really is but yeah I really want to believe it's so bad that those kind of be consequences for these people [noise]\nYou know the part of me says there's no way that's ever going to happen because they're too powerful but then I Want to believe it so it looks like he's he's given them enough rope to hang themselves that's what it looks like [noise]\nYou know or you just sent me\nAnd the title kind of gives me the ... why the media is warning

because they're going to manufacture it well that's the answer I kind of expected to here yeah\nBecause the deep state is much bigger than elected officials and people of a particular party yes radiology or did not Trump reference gold global is in this interest rate thing I\nI tell you people need to understand that these so called deep state whatever you want to call them they will stop at nothing to get things back to where they have to go in because you know they didn't expect any of this I didn't expect Trump ... none of this was never supposed to come to we've never supposed to have known any that's about the FBI any of this stuff\nIf Hillary had one would probably be in World War three with Russia Russia by now [noise]\nAnd we weren't supposed to know any of this and I think they will do anything and that includes assassinating the presidents that includes starting a war they will do whatever they have to do in part when\nQuite frankly proud of Rand Paul for using a\nWord yeah is that if they don't stop this somebody's going to get assassinated and almost tap into dead softball game [laughter] right and then some guy that wanted to blow himself up on the mall that was

my daughter said boy I Hope you get to go through in a period like I did in the eighties where it was just got better and better and then it got better than you ever thought it could be better\nAnd that seemed to be the path that we were headed on who should be [noise] and yeah\nIt's nice it's it's all about confidence they see these marketing remembers that rattles table that might be on the precipice of buying something you know are making a lot of money spending decision exactly or maybe I better wait until [laughter] save this stops [noise] I don't know what Trump can do though [noise]\nOut about the fed\nI mean and there is a worry in some circles I'm we're Peter Schiff has one source us on TALK about this a couple of months ago is that uh we never really had a correction and the way we should of after two thousand night if you had always done has re inflate\nThe bubble to a more standing level you know what brand had even mentioned that before too and you know when I say bubble doesn't mean oldest we'd had to create new wealth of course there's new jobs being ...\nBeing created but the idea is that your it's like you're building a house and you realize oh we don't have enough bricks to complete this project and the whole project just goes to put [noise] and I think there it's possible that this market this whole economy worldwide is\nRelying on very low interest rates and so you're damned if you do damned if you don't see why you shouldn't have to keep interest rates low for too long the feds right you get it ridiculous runaway inflation if you start to raise them up and that's why they're stair stepping up by twenty five basis points\nAs a quarter of a percent and they're telling people that they're really foreshadowing here's what we're going to do they're trying to do it in a way for the market doesn't on wind all at once\nBut if you've had gross for now a decade now in the last two years at a more steady writer ridiculously rate and those insurance go up and go to unravel you have things that people don't it's like the housing market [noise]\nWon't won't let me ask you this joy is it possible that during the Obama administration that they artificially inflated the state that the stock market and now it's catching up with is\nWell I I always wonder yeah because I remember\nWas an air blow ten at the beginning of his term and then it kept getting higher and higher and higher incrementally that little set bags here and there but\nEverything else in the economy going nowhere ... exactly showing his son was alright so if that was an artificial bubble again though who's got the answer who can who can explain this to the people that make sense out of it that's a concern yeah and a\nBrand has talked about it is it's all he's mentioned artificial and there's going to be some correction and it's going to hurt\nThe economy is just blowing and going it's gonna hurt these corrections are going to hurt and I think this is what he's talking about right and I'm I'm One of the folks to maybe it's two fatalistic of maybe it's because I don't have a lot of assets and my name's especially not tied up in the stock market uh but if we have another crashed like All right\nLet's go through it\nKnow bailouts I agree no more guy special like drinking as opposed to Clinton's everything but as if they ban\nGiving us band aids at all to get us through it is not going to do any good what we read the words too big to fail [laughter] yeah right uh-huh well and and to me I Want to know as you came to mind a few years ago it was like we're dry we're getting a terrible hanging over and over weight\nAnd it's like but we still got to make this cross country bender happened man [laughter]\nSo let's get another few fence a whiskey announced it wants to keep driving a man that is true it's a lot of fun and people are looking I'm going to you're drunk stop driving on the interstate eighty miles an hour man we might be it went on

[noise]\nI'm gonna see that story\nThe newspapers at the New York times decided recently been great idea to show everybody how their vaunted blue way was shaping up by pulling a number of us races in the house and Senate and show their demented readers the results in real time\nBelied poll scheduled for yesterday included the close quote close Senate races in Texas Nevada and Tennessee three races which GOP incumbents are facing what's considered to be strong democratic challengers like beat off O'Rourke in Texas challenging Ted Cruz\n[noise] so what happened the times polling advantage does show the race between Trump bashing rhino Dean Heller and Democrat Jackie rose and very close but was hell or in the lead that was the good news for the time step in Texas where the times is repeatedly portrayed Irish Bob\n... another Kennedy as if that were a good thing for me no Ted Cruz comes there was a very comfortable nine point lead ... and I think that's what he'll win by [noise]\nIt's still Texas they haven't ruined it yet not yet they're working on n Tennessee it gets even worse for all the newspapers of the times especially since most there no doubt huge Taylor Swift fans and that and told Republican Marsha Blackburn was gained momentum and every poll taken there in the last month holds a whopping Eighteen percent lead over her democratic challenger is don't put your foot in\nYour mouth and by the way project ...\nHurt the you know the guy that wants to see what's his name Brett is and he said he would have voted for Kavanaugh but ah he was out and buy some step ever saying no that's not true man in that yeah\n[noise] uh the urge\nPrior to yesterday the times conducted similar polling in a large number of house races around the country and again ended up with far more of those red guys and gals leading their favorite blue people than the fake news ... just you know I really didn't make this stuff you can see all of the results [noise] and it gives a link [noise]\nSee Democrats can only be civilization elections and he touches on\nEverybody yeah it is I ... and then I I completely agree with him and this next statement as the headline on today's log every color demonstrates white decent people don't vote Democrat [noise] they've\nBut why do you think there when they want to open borders who the hell the sky to their head screwed on straight would want that kind of exactly want to be represented by these psychopath they have made us when the army and especially and it was all paid for we know that we know that George Soros related groups\nYou know paid for this insanity and hundred and forty six million dollars just to oppose Kavanaugh [noise]\nMoney well spent or Mr Soros why they can't touch him is beyond me that that's what I Will say everybody knows where all this stuff comes from\nAnd if it's bought and paid for it's not real ... it's you know when you're paid to go raise hell and the and I never could figure out how the only people that got tickets in the Senate chamber where the crazies [noise]\nUnderstand that um until we see a level of behavior that's a [noise] within\nThe norms of the United states maybe was just close off\nBecause I think Rand Paul is right I don't know what's going to be but somebody's going to end up to do because they are just provoking provoking provoking discouraging and so [noise]\nIt is going to be heroes I Do this [noise] here is Brenda\nOkay this is my personal take on a little bit attack the Dell we we spent ten days in all in the summer and it was a phenomenal experience we didn't do for the call it a bit late then right we went for the food and he's had a great time\nWhere we stayed with a Nineteen forty RV park we pulled arcane ferns and you know they like the local sales but um we talk to one of the guys fair and he you know we're kind of meant for friends and he he told us not to say it loud\nThat we were conservative you know don't 'cause we were talking about how bad I hated Hillary anyway\nHey\nHey you can't say that the Larry tonight or for he was the ... military retired military they say that he found that to lay out here and we were like all kinds of everywhere we went we thought that he or into whatever in her own a car\nWhile every last\nIn Austin, Texas but now they're coming at it and to hear you say this today because I Know in order to be on my voted for him in the primary or president in ... now but I'm\nThe whole thing out of there he's given I guess he's given he's running an aunt ah Ted Cruz I'm and I'm I'm Glad to hear that you're going to leave it right but those people are more liberal you could not walk anywhere and I mean clothing is optional in Austin but\nBrian sales nurse they optional wow that's who you're talking about low information voters they want they're going for that that got they best sorry\nYou know and that's the capital of the state I Am kind of baffled as to how it that particular city's been overrun\nThem if you start going it's a huge we we were the fattest state on often um Alabama here you've got all these people do not\nI mean they are health conscious Google fair a fair either you know they're going to be bigger than Nashville and if they're not they're now they're one of the fastest growing city who we enjoyed our sales were had a great I'm a I mean everybody's on the panel born running\nHealth conscious of that great but they're very very young and I guess they're just going with you know brainwashed whatever their\nLittle but I Would also bring that there's a simple thing I use a city or or to the Democratic party for a board of the Republican Party truth urban areas tend to\nThink like a big city would say to interview grudge talked about this with Mayor Daley in Chicago when he was a big city millions of people packed\nOn top of one another and it kind of want somebody with an iron fist to keep things straight but when you're living out in the country and miles and miles away from her next neighbor but maybe it's a small town everybody knows your name you don't need the big kinda overcame regulation and government\nOr any my point of view would be okay we've cities in ... so the federal government should be and often what city do what they do what ... going to do with the chicken it's um but the odd [noise]\nI agree
