large deficits\nAnd we were witnessing literally the loss of our of our automobile industry parts and companies are to Mexico on to other places so the people who say we shouldn't have have um we shouldn't have renegotiated this thing\nAre just that you know engaging and self deception I might I might know that both the secretary Clinton and President Obama both when they ran for president\nPromised that would renegotiate it they just didn't do it in the final analysis but they both acknowledged that it needed to be arraigned dot and so what the president did which I which I think was terrific\nBlock in in history at one point two trillion dollars and we've now rewritten the rules in ways that are there better quite frankly for all three countries particularly better for America that's who had to pay my bills and who I care about\nAnd better in a whole variety of ways it's the the auto rules of origin are extremely important in terms of making sure that manufacturing

so there's there's a whole variety of things in various pockets of the extremely important agreement\nBetter than than anything the United states as ever negotiated before it's going to make a real difference for working men and women in this country now some businesses and some Wall Street guys left to figure out another way to make a fortune\nBut in terms of working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's going to make a big difference and it's going to be this is\nThe the the President Trump trade a um butter type and we're going to use it going forward with countries around the world so it's really really an important day for\nTalking above Lighthizer us trade rap\nOne of the chain of course negotiators in getting us to this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement a Bob one of the things that were wondering how this works in a still Republican majority Congress\nCould this mean what's the mechanism for this passing when there's there are some Republicans supporting it some probably won't but more Democrats would support this than Republicans correct\n[laughter] well I Would not say that I think you're going to find a Republicans and Democrats both supported uh hopefully strongly there there are a few Republicans who will probably oppose it because they don't like the fact that we're going to bring manufacturing back and they think that that uh\nOutsourcing is not a problem there are some Democrats little posted in in part because it's just something that the president wants and they're against that or they think it doesn't go far enough [noise]\nBut but I think ah the vast majority of fair minded members in both parties\nWill support this now what are the criticism you have which is sort of an odd one in the wall Street Journal is they have this view that well we never should've talked to labor unions and Democrats when we put it together\nAnd then they draw the conclusion that for that it's worse for us\nWell if the Democrats should uh take over and of course the exact opposite is true we we we designed this to be bipartisan for working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's not something I I Believe it's going to end up being\nPurely partisan and if it is are the kind of thing that can only be pass with Republican votes if that's what we had to go she hated that I Would agree with the with the people who say it would have trouble passing but that's not how it was designed and it's not what we did\nThis is what I'm John horrible\nIn autos let's listen to there are some elements of manage trained in it that are less free that is to say the provisions for the auto industry if those provisions work\nIt means our cars will get more expensive for us consumers but there's also a chance that they are complicated enough that they won't be worth it for automakers to comply which means that the president's statement about a new dawn for the auto industry that is almost certainly not correct your\nCall I guess my I mean if I had to make one word it would be nonsense [noise]\nUh you wonder about people who make statements like that they're they're so palpable crazy and you wonder what else there thing that is also crazy so just to give you an idea all the ... the major auto companies General Motors Ford SCA was used to cry sir Honda and Toyota have\nAll said this is fine they can work with this they've all set is going to move more jobs back to America but that's not a bad thing\nYeah that's a good thing they've all set is workable they've all endorsed it so that the kind of people who don't know very much about what's going on and make those kind of wild statements I Would just take him to sit down and boosting their belt and they're tired and breathe ten times and then just reading something about it\nAnd they'll realize how they don't know what they're talking about this is going to be\nReally very very important for um for American manufacturing it's going to bring a lot of jobs back\nWe at the end by the way it's not bad for for Mexico or for Canada either it'll it'll help them to the biggest single thing we do let me just give you an idea of the biggest thing we do or what the two biggest things we do want is we increase the content\nOf cars that are sold in America and Mexico and Canada but sold in America\nThat the the the content that is made in this region is increasing right now we say it's sixty two percent and it's really more like about fifty because of loopholes and all this special interest off we're going to raise it up to Seventy five percent\nHow was that a bad thing under under the ... the person who's going to lose out on this is China and places like that\nUnder the TPP that these people all endorsed half the car can be made in China and sold in America duty free it's completely lunacy the people don't know what they're talking about the other thing is we're requiring that a certain percent of the car [noise]\nBe made in a high wage area that is to say in America that could be Canada also but in America for the most part\nThat's not a bad thing at all why shouldn't we say if we're going to give you the benefit of selling cars indoor market with no duties better than we treat anyone else in the world why shouldn't we say that a certain amount of those cars should be made in America by American labor\nWell I think what President Trump prominence on this on the campaign trail he promised he delivered Bob Lighthizer us TR what's next I mean are you guys going to get a deal done with their up some of the European countries bilateral deals with Switzerland and some of these other\nSmaller countries I Know they and the Swiss are anxious to do a deal with the guys I Know that first hand\nYeah and that we have a variety of things that we're we're talking to the Japanese were talking to the Europeans [noise]\nWe have a lot of things that we're doing a small deals dot com singles doubles that people don't even know about where talk out one color through 'em but there's a bunch of other countries and then of course the big the big elephant in the room is China\nAnd one of the funniest things I'll tell you there's one last time on the wall Street Journal editorial because you brought it up they kind of show a graph of the American S. and P.\nAnd then they mark certain things are sort of say oh look at this was bad for the U.S and the what they don't mark\nIs when when the president announced history has thrill one which was like in March\nPresident put on tariffs on China intellectual property and into it for intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer the market's gone straight up from them I was kind of laughing this was like one of these\nOne of the things you've got you've got ten data points less

current hospital offer to ensure held a life insurance policy but I think it's about five hundred thousand um my new employer\nTheir life insurance policy they offer is only one hundred thousand and I can't get it um otherwise I have some other means his orders and I just I get denied or I'd have an outrageously expensive policy and I just\nI'm trying to think outside the box so I'm not stuck in a job and I'm Lynn happy because of this one issue\nDo I don't know how you're going to be making more of the other position it'll be the same okay I'm\nBetter I only have to drive ten minutes instead of an hour [laughter]\nI Wonder if the new place the new hospital or whoever has enough flexibility that they had some insurance programs to their group plan to allow you to buy more\nI asked about that and they said the man that I spoke with said that it's a bundled package and he doesn't believe that's the case mhm uh aspect with um our investor and he um he said he goes to buy your children well and he's like about him manage on account\nAnd a ... [laughter] and I never heard of it All right I'm going to start buying bonds to offset the fact that you don't have insurance so it's not you know that's what he's doing and that no thank you um\nI mean you you need to build up a big pile of money he called wells and then you don't have to worry about life insurance so that's the general principle that you moved towards a mountain\nOf their house off in December we don't have any debt um\nAnd so you know as much by the more well if you have the less and less we need to worry about replacing your income for the good of your family mhm\nIf you're having a oils that your family is fine and you have no debt and your family's fine without your income than we don't worry about the subject anymore because you become ...\nDoes your income to live right on to the extent they don't need that is to the extent you don't need life insurance now have you actually shopped or are you making an assumption that you can't get insurance\nI got denied about seven years ago and I tried calling\n... calls end or insurance and the market has changed dramatically\nWhen I got another diagnosis back in March that when I Lived a life insurance and this diagnosis it um they basically said get denied but I haven't tried Zander\nTrying them I mean there's no it doesn't cost anything to ask mhm let's talk about it and found out that I don't I think you may be right I mean if you know you probably found some valid research and probably not and ... you know so the only question is just you know if your family only got a hundred grand instead of getting five hundred grand how old are you\nThirty eight and and\nThe auto immune that you've got I mean how are you know you're a health care professional uh does do you have a real threat here of losing your life\nYou can't there's different degrees of it and mine mild but I um when they hit your record it kind of gone down by the\nActual fact you die\nI Am Lee is left without you what's the probability of that\nLand on NATO how's it going on and on and get help so I mean it could get worse you know you never know how old are you thirty eight okay\nSo I mean in the next ten years a typical thirty eight year old who have very low probability short of an accident of passing away and yours is slightly greater resolve it's not like to have a terminal cancer diagnosis right right okay so I'm not going to worry about it I'm gonna take the job I Want\nAnd then use your fabulous income which you have to build wealth and to become debt free in the family but I mean if you're sitting there with a million dollars in mutual funds and your four one K. and mutual funds and everything's paid for house and everything and he passed away I think your husband struggled through\nYeah I think you know and that's what I mean by self insured by becoming wealthy\nAnd they got about three hundred thousand in retirement them in your house is ... and you get a hundred thousand and insurance so you know he is he gonna be okay yeah you'll be OK yeah plus I'm guessing they weren't tried he or she is now so I mean he's going to be okay so I'm taking the job\nOkay

five five sued to Jim is with us here in Philadelphia Hi Jim how are you\nGoing to Dave thanks for having me on sure what's up [noise] um\nMy wife and I work currently in baby steps to uh we started this time last year with about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in debt or we've been on tenth and paid off our down some dollars wow as of this month yes a sold my brand new pickup truck sold\nA race car um wow everything yeah so we um we have an an interesting situation a we have one child and we're looking to expand our family however we're going to need to um we needed to do ivy F um we still have another\nSix thousand dollars left or to pay off a rational income [noise] ah we're making about a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year right now\nSo you did a hundred and ... year but a lot of that was from selling stuff I'm pretty much\nA large lecture which was the math telling you that it's got how long has it going to take you do the show the sixty\nUm [noise] if we if we continue on this course where a how are you from literally sold everything so the rest of it's just going to be working really hard I think it's going to be probably about another year maybe a little bit more\nWhat I was thinking that's what I Would ask him on a cell that OK cool and so what is the pricing model of uh VS that you guys are looking at\nUm well we actually met with a doctor a few months ago and got a ballpark of about twenty thousand mhm\nUm [noise] uh just you know we haven't\nFound anything or start any any profit says yeah we're just still kind of shopping around but twenty thousands or we're looking at a we've sort of go with other couples and all the cricket who's got around there um\nLet me give me a little inside okay this comes like a lot because babies are important\nI mean having kids is a big deal it's an emotional thing and it causes people to ah you know to to change their financial directions and the to violate things and everything else so let me tell you I I absolutely know nothing about medical things I Am a medical idiots okay but uh\nHave actually been involved in about this decision probably a hundred times over the years and what I Am hearing\nEven as late as last week a with couples that we are coaching on this is that when they press and they fined several different pricing models and prices\nYou don't just accept the first opinion you get on\nHow you go about this okay right in other words I heard the other day are thirty five thousand for one pricing model but that was like a guarantee as many times as you need to to do it till you get a baby right\nSomebody what you told me so far so\nGood so okay so the the ... renting out Ninety five thousand dollars on miles that's what it takes to pay the mortgage off correct\nCorrect okay\nAnd the next thing you need to do is you need to talk to a real estate agent and find out what this house was actually\nWorse because right now you don't\nYeah I don't I don't know I don't know exactly who is it my wife I'm it's my wife had a great grandma so I Know where I live on their lowest say there was a it's a hundred and three but I don't know if that's even ... they're not\nOr nothing like little I was not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes okay if you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great abide\n\nBy just being okay by it's not like you're getting paid for a great deal there were you just went wow that's the best deal ever ride because as I\nLike to even get kicked out because someone gated or should I leave should or should I go back in or\nWere you know I Want to be long term or that you want to own um\nWhy she we kind of didn't want to own because we got a daughter she's four and my wife she that school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now\nMhm have you got every angle\nArea it's like I say my wife great grandma's house and she'd been here her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres\nMhm and um it's kind of in a country girl part of Atlanta gotcha okay and how old are you to\nMy wife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days so we both twenty now ... and you got\nA one child you said and how much debt that you have\nA we don't have any debt\nOkay and what's your household income\nUh make uh every year but I'm trying to get in school but I had to kind of work with the answer to that was an eye on march ... um I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month and your wife doesn't work [noise]\nOkay that's pretty ... and that's where he lied on your budget is is very tight on your budget\nOr do you recommend it means I Lived in eighty so now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff on how to eat and we're already kind of you know trying to start it off a little better and it's\nGood for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the\nHouse the only way you can buy it is the ah the relatives that are involved that would be the errors or this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court you're not going to get a lawyer and go to probe a court and probate court would have to rule that the house to be sold and would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now\nAnd now with all the more the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages are paid I doubt they are going to get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should I as a kind of want to actually start even going into real estate because I Do construction and that's what I Do know I kind of this house has kinda is not ... it's kind of beat up and fight the last few years she hit her head and like other relatives staying there kind of beating it up so I mean I don't know if they like\nMaybe work more maybe you know what I'm saying they Lincoln Flint they didn't get another\nHouse or an Olympic unless you become the owner of it and and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to you'd had I see in a statement learning anything they just hurry up and now like lions bears and why should I\nTell you what I Would do if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from the south some day when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it\nYou're probably not gonna ever bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about okay so\nWhat I Would do is pay the rent or pay that payment is rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't fret about becoming the owner today\nIt's inexpensive rent and the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be in and I just got to be a really strenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even know who the errors are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of the day is this is not that many on 'em or that they actually even know about it like I say we we been here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried that the thing you're paying it or not just keep paying it\nIn because that's not the language that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYeah but I'm I'm just worried like nobody called me and get me out 'cause it's not in my name\nYeah they're going to take you out the people that only ... years but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nAnd they they are they're far away they're like in another state and\nYou know but they're not they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than a vote on it\nIf it was valuable now there'd be some sharks in them water circling right but it's not got any value because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it because some of that you're just gonna walk off and leave it\nYeah because they cause I've already done paying eight and\nAnd they had because that's money whatever money you spend and make her happy money is\nGone when you leave because there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing to probate court\nAnd get the deed transferred to your name and you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent\nTo a place you kind of like living\nAnd uh you know six hundred bucks rent in line is not a bad gig on two and a half acres\nSo I'm sitting there if I'm you for now\nUh now hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any one harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and someday you're just going to move on\nQuite worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner then get ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the bud court actions and you probably can work this through if you can\nGather up all the people you need to sign on it and that's what you're facing so it's an interesting situation but\nMy guess is it's not worth any more than his old on it my guess is probably fairly close on that\nIf we thought it was worth two hundred thousand bucks is a relative thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks a Ninety thousand was out and they were going to get a hundred thousand their pocket when it's all\nThose sharks would already been circling\nThey'd have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the courts Lou it when you die without a wheel and you don't have to go in and the judge has to you know authorize the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs\nAre just like it would in a will but it's just a lot bigger mess and do you can't get cleaned title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it\nAny other ways of doing it properly and getting clean titled 'cause you won't be able to sell it if you don't get going title [noise]\nSo that's how you do it if you decided to do it later but for today I Would treat it as cheap rent\nIt's a rental house how much money would you spend on a rental house that you're going to move off and you don't own a nod any that's what you would do hope that helps my aunt's thanks for calling in this is the Dave Ramsey shower\n[noise]\nOf calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't

boyfriend if you have a friend that is not allowed to touch money in any way because her husband her boyfriend is incomplete extreme control of every decision around the finances I'll give you a Ninety percent probability he's hitting her\nThat's how that's how strong this study correlation was I mean there's just because there's so many it's a it's all about control and it's all about

driving force but it was really easy to\nGet on board so you guys looked at it and together in all seriousness other than the overdoing the day room she part I'm you looked at it together and said hey if we really rolled up our sleeves we could pay off their spouse that's it had an a ha moment huh\nYup and we're we're a good team we bounce ideas off each other and we always seem to the same conclusion as to what we were going to do and and here we are\nNow you don't have a payment in the world not then and the grass does do better when you walk on it I'm telling you it's not an exaggeration it's a great metaphor but it's also the truth yeah very cool very cool so how long have you been married eleven years have you ever been dead for a while you were married ...\nThis

come from discount stores I never buy anything on sale that's just how and I and I don't see that changing ever ... if you want it to I mean you you don't have any payments and then I DNA I'd I'd go straight to the sale ... well\nThat share and she always tells me how much money she saved me which means it costs me something by a U.S nuts but nowadays we can afford it it's not a big deal if you like no one else later you can live and give like no one else and you guys are in that position so did you have people thought you were crazy or detractors or did you have a more cheerleaders\nUh we

Oklahoma has more earthquakes in way dealing California from oil drilling fracking primarily and when I was\nActually that is true they are having more earthquakes but it isn't really fracking it is the it's the injection of the wastewater from fracking that is causing those are like well that's what I mean by the ...\nYeah well you're right indirectly it is but uh they're working other other places where we can inject water all all day it's that's a really a problem to be solved by geologist or they need to tell us where we can safely inject water where we can't and then uh and then will reduce the possibility of quakes\nSure possibility Steve that this entire planet to just have some horrendous catastrophe that something could happen just shattered the planet to\nAbsolutely it could you know I I Hope it never happens and and you know all we can do though with with the things is adapt that's what we that's what we do with the storms so it's we do with the sea level rise we've been doing that for\nA thousands of years uh there's really no evidence that we can control the climate we can do something locally with temperatures and locally but ... with weather but not on a global scale I'm very unlikely that we can control the climate at this point\nHow to British Columbia Canada we go to the first time caller Terri Hi Terry thanks for calling\nMan that's a good night to be having this discussion I most appreciate it to say a George what were your knowledge first than if the current age as the information age use or are the ...\nThank you [laughter] ... [laughter] I I Am the Lone Ranger [laughter] I have lost most of my credibility\n[noise] I'm a killer researcher but people think I'm Crazy or heated and bringing up these these arguments that you do it means nothing in there is [laughter] it it it it's a boom warming is a very sexy position\nBecause people feel smart and that if I just you know say my balls or do whatever all the the planet and [laughter]\nI'm sure you've heard it before but a big thing that I Love to bring up in this totally discredited like Mr gloom to address this or the Ninety thousand to cargo ships at sea third bumping [noise]\n[laughter] to the era\nThat must have a profound effect on the um\nWell there is there there is an issue right now I'm cargo ships use fairly high so for fuel fairly furry dirty fuel um and I think the uh I Can't remember which organization is but the but the international organization on shipping\nHas actually agreed to uh go move to some different a lower so for fuel types\nAnd a lot of folks in the industry think that it's going to be a problem it's probably a good step though so I'm generally in favor of moving to lower so for fuel overtime [noise] um there's a lot of people also talking about cutting greenhouse gases from ships though ... primarily carbon dioxide I think that probably is not such a good idea\nBut that is one of those real real pollution problems we need to clean up we also need to do a little ah improve uh the problem with the litter of plastic and the oceans that's another issue\nThat we need to work out and I learned a decision was the international maritime organization thank you that's [laughter]\nThat's it and they're they're predicting that the the increase is going to be huge or in the next several years by twenty fifty if no action is taken in ... by up to two hundred and fifty percent that's a big jump the sulfur yeah [noise]\nUh possibly so yeah I I couldn't really comment on that but I think so I think that's probably a good step\nLet's go to roots in Portland, Oregon Hi roots go ahead\nHi hey and very guarded and thank you for filling in my blank spaces that I have no control over their hands\nOkay\nNo I'm saying I'm asking is I think we ought to he ordered um right now and if you give us some kind of a of a plan they can make our world more free I'm\nPaying it forward now putting our technology and in in a place where we can bring our energy to where it can be free for everybody that would be great and I think they can do it and\nMight be here that you are here donate you know making our our uh dams in a\nEcosystem better and I've done that aren't even even the little people out here like me and a man is bigger than I Am can pay it forward right now I think that we all can live free I mean without anything\nThat would be great but Steven they're going to want to make money on this ...\nI mean one of the great points that I talk about in the uh the second chapter of outside the green boxes the rise of democracy or the United states basically was the first modern democracy now we have\nAre just about I think it's almost Ninety nations that have a they have a form of democratic government so it's gone from zero to Ninety nations\nIt's a legal equality and freedom of speech religion rule of law lemonade show slavery women's suffrage personal property rights a lot of other things so the world is getting freer\nOh that's a very positive thing and it's all part of this idea that everybody is better off there's a lot of people going around saying the world's gonna collapse overpopulation we've got pollution we read always terrible things\nBut people are healthier lives and and one aspect of that is the rise of democracy\nSee what do we do with people's cars this to me is one of the most heartbreaking situations people who cannot afford electricity or their gas or let's say it's the dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it\nWhat do we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nYeah that's a tough situation actually the United states is in better shape than many European places because uh we have very low costs electricity um\nA crisis here in the United states they often put up a graph comparing Europe almost all the ... the nations in Europe have higher or electricity prices I mean we have here in the United states we have the lowest cost natural gas in the world [noise] uh right now with the biggest petroleum pollute the producer\nThat we should we said though that nobody nobody gets shut off during implement weather or can we say that\nI Am not going to get into that I Do think many of the the uh the utilities have that sort of policy that they're either not allowed to do that by law they have a policy where they're not going to do that during\n[noise] and they tend to postpone things in the summer I\nThink hold on Steve we've got a break we'll come back we'll talk more and take final

we'll come back and final segment with Stephen Moore I'm Steve when you're out of vents what seems to be the question that most people want answered\nWell um there are many um\n[noise] you know I speak a lot to businesses and one of the things I I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the choir [laughter] yeah but the funny thing is though they don't realize that the majority of us business\nThinks that the climate laws and the energy laws are foolish in many ways\nThe headlines or grab by a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and a political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of of American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in a majority\nOf so it's a little bit of a strange situation [noise]\nUm [noise]\nLet's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong is some is uh something that people come up with them it has to do with some of the assumptions\nUm are they concerned about anything [noise]\nWell they you know back in Nineteen Ninety the United nations and the inter governmental panel on climate change predicted that a temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade\nA with a mix of five ten so low of too tense and if you put those uninsured\nThose rights pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we we are much less than that so we're we're below the estimates for the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing the the rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions of the climate models are wrong\nAnd natural factors dominate global temperatures\nLet's go to Joe in Long Island New York he used to the Rockies Hey Joe go ahead\nA faith and trust things show a actually a warm climate change I wanted to be warmer but I'll ask him\nA and a comment a got a quick uh my first question would be a we just had a and in fact in Indonesia unfortunately and they said that they weren't really warm\nBut that was supposed to be a beacon now we're working where the people could've shouted a long way of this thing so I I relate this to a ocean temperatures how well monitored all ocean temperatures\nWith that a second question would be a political climate you know I only talk about the last couple of weeks twenty four seven as the uh you know Brett Kavanaugh are in his shoes and uh and uh\nYou know it does make me think that the senators don't have time to study science never or the tourist and\nReally don't have a good grasp of science maybe they'd ... course thirty forty fifty years ago and science and never really updated themselves on their own\nUh and uh you know I don't want to pick on trial before he got and blamed for the recent hurricane or in the Washington Post\nAnd then my comment would be uh you said the nuclear ... or a industry uh was traditional\nAnd I think it's a like a lot of people are a potential disaster waiting to happen I Know it doesn't contribute to climate a big ... CEO too but if you look at Chernobyl\nThat's still only buried at still active it's never been contained nobody can go within fifty miles from the place ... years later\nSo uh you you take New York for example you got to the point right man I'm uh there's big metro area or something that happened with that then what happens in New York City\nSo you got a whole bunch of things that are I think there were three of them one was uh what are we doing with ocean temperature measurements the uh\nThe national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has I think they are the ones who put out these diving\nUm a measuring devices I forget the name of them again but they have thousands of 'em out there now but\nUh they've only been deployed for about a twelve to Fifteen Years so we really only have data and the ocean temperatures are from measurements are over the last twelve to Fifteen Years before that it was just you know people will take them and chips and kind of measurements are going around and those were very accurate\nThe um and then you said about ... uh what's um let's see ... the third one was the nuclear plants I think one of the big issues with nuclear plants that they need need to solve is I Need to be able to shut down automatically\nWe still have plants so most of the ones that are on the world that are relying on cooling systems in the cooling systems the failed\nLike happened with the Saddam in Japan then we have a chance for a big melt down so that problem needs to be solved um the other big problem with nuclear is is just frankly natural gas is so darn cheap right now nobody will build a nuclear plant and I think the third one was um\nSatellites boy you said something about governments and once you have questions\nYeah I'm just wondering do I I think they know him and I read or an undefeated about five times in the U.S Congress\nI think the majority of the and arguably more than half of the United states so members of Congress right now do not think global warming is a dangerous problem or most of those around the Republican side of course\nAnd as I mentioned we have we have we now have a climate revolts if you will in Australia and Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it uh this has been a disaster crisis for more than Twenty years now and we're really not seeing the disaster so\nI'm hopefully I've covered most of your issues\nI think the biggest problem we've got as an ex learn from the sun that could wipe out our power grid in a rigorous useless forever\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again if the if all those ... go off in Antarctica ... a big bunch of ... itself the of the of the peninsula\nUm again we need to adapt as well we can and the biggest one is an ice age boy I like this warm weather folks I Do not want to see the start of the studies that\nWe've got we've got a guess Robert seem to believe is we're in the early stage of an ice age more okay who knows Walter in Pennsylvania taken away well go ahead\nBy Georgia needless to say great to talk to you once again George\nThank you Walter\nCharge him out with all due respect Mr Gore I'm sounds a lot like a doctor Kimball\nGeorge with all due respect them is to grow them I don't think that Dr Paul Ehrlich has been discredited though I think George I think it's just common sense\nThat the human population was planning to not increase on in the NIH them\nNow George we share this planet with myriad other species are not modern agriculture may have been the case that uh\nYou know the ancient a bane of law and then but modern agriculture consumes much natural habitat and now we're going to the human population is driving the yellow he thought station just as in this country\nYou know we have largely eradicated the great a herd of buffalo ... oh so you know naturally you you could not twenty million a\nGreat by sitting her as it used to be twenty million in a hurry you could ... it would be compatible with the agriculture wind up by some horribly wrong we have a bad some fields of corn and soybeans and we sell off\nYou know I I just think it's common sense that the human population cannot increase out and then all of them\nWill there comes a point Steve is they're not that you know you can't have a population of twenty billion people on the planet\nNo you can't and and you make good points well but the the the uh predictions are now that we're going to level of about ten and a half billion there is no doubt that the we've radically transform the surface of the earth\nAh we're certainly have done that and taking over large portions of it and I think we're sixty million by some at one time estimates on those days are gone there are some good news there are some good news by the way Dr like of the one set of who's a betting man he predicted that by the year two thousand and England would no longer exist\nThat PBS Spain is two to four fifty one twenty to\nOn

working ... hours away\nThat they want to continue it was where they could say well you don't look busy go help them pay the parking lot or ... or so we get some downtime within\nOur work day die and we get your breakfast every morning and there was an incredible this morning oh yeah it does make it worth it yeah\nIt really does and I love doing it too and I joined in five days a week now for okay well that by the way a demar we have Reuben sandwich is here a boy and you guys want to come over\nAll right Greg well you need to write a rough morning [laughter] you got a lot to do [laughter]\nAnd we love visiting with five days later [laughter] All right all the guys who are out\nSo that was it was interesting\nI really I was serious\nI Know I Know you are because you've you've come in before like you don't like to be off very long\nBecause it throws off your your whole saying\nWell you know there's a there's another thing now I don't think this is as prevalent now because when the economy was in the doldrums for eight long years\nOf there were frequent stories about people not using their vacation time in part because they were afraid that if they left and it appeared that their job could be filled with out\nMore no I I Know what you mean yeah like ah so and so did a job did the job more efficiently\nAnd a window that a lot of people were afraid to use their vacation time and\nI think that's changing yesterday Amazon announced that they were raising their minimum wage employees to be a theme bucks yeah from what though do you know uh I think twelve\nEleven or twelve that ... range from when you're walking leg or something but here's the thing you know because politicians are you know they were going to make it mandatory minimum wage at Fifteen\nI mean you know cause people to lose their jobs because businesses don't work that way but you have now\nIs there are more jobs that can be filled so there's competition for competent people say you have to pay more because those Amazon employees at the lower end of the pay scale no and I'm sure they look when you when you want to make more money you look around you you check the market and every butts hiring is through the roof right now\nThat's how you raise the minimum wage by creating competition and employers therefore are willing to pay more to get good people\nRight and uh you don't need to pass a law that we've discussed as the great lengths just get rid of the minimum wage you don't need it when your country's economy is operating the way it should be a deal like Trump or not right now ours is\nOne sided tuition at Amazon is actually pretty bad that was pretty bad though and maybe I think maybe this the first step but then trying to fix that but there's a lot of employees who are just and they were getting bad press I mean by massively disgruntled ... uh and and just a situation they couldn't get away from their uh\nWhen the minimum wage right now seven in the corner I think you're right yeah um I don't mind that\nBeing paid if somebody's and turning and learning and all that kind of stuff or it's truly menial labor\nAh for businesses need somebody on the ball and sharp a that is a natural outgrowth of a thriving economy [noise]\nThe ah I have a friend that works for an Amazon distribution center way south west of Chicago and she said you would not believe the conditions here yeah I mean they were you talk about we get to go I'm going to go down to the think instead of right now and check traffic\nThey're getting bathroom breaks and everything else is like a a you know a major procedure is that you wouldn't want to work\nTheir trust you know what the minimum wage was when I when I started working at McDonald's I'm just I just looked at I Know it was a buck sixty an hour when a buck sixty yeah [laughter] at mailing shoes in Chicago and I remember being taken back and getting a good review from\nThe you know the manager and getting a nickel raising that

O. J. and FBI they miss McLean knows\nAnd keep in mind a lot of these career bureaucrats who are stuck in the deal Jane it beyond that you can't get rid of because they're married employees\nA lot of these guys are not loyal to Donald Trump and even participated in trying to take him out before I elected right\nWow can you imagine the network of political allies this woman has there yeah\nAnd you know I said one of her lawyers is a lousy forward guy named Michael Brown which doesn't mean much to most people\nMichael Brown which was FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe right hand man he was the deputy to Andrew McCabe\nAnd have ... Ford's lawyer shows us that the guy that was that the hearing with the beard his shows up in that city yeah yeah [noise] now does it all started to come to yeah you know I said friday that I didn't believe this woman\nOr maybe it was Monday I just I didn't believer\nHe's the guy the here at the higher that's him Michael Brown which deputy to Andrew McCabe\nWhy\nWhy why these groups of people why is it the same group of people who were trying to take out Trump before the election show up surrounding blondes the Ford\nAn escorting her through the process to essentially throw the mid term so that the Democrats can get the house in the Senate and the ...\nYeah and make sure he can't follow through with appointing people like Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court that he can't follow through with undoing\nThree and a half decades of globalism in corporate ism is destroyed this country you know that he can't follow through with getting a an appointment to replace Jeff Sessions if necessary or to replace Rod Rosenstein if necessary\nKick as this is all part of the election thing I I actually did not know whether the event happened\nWhen did not know whether Brett Kavanaugh forcefully tried to to hoist himself upon\nChristine lousy for I truthfully didn't know after watching it oh I Know I didn't think there was enough evidence\nTo say it was more likely than not had happened in ... some standard life for foreigners the evidence you got to let the nomination go through you can't knock people are just on the basis of our series like ... ...\nGave her credibility you know I just said I don't think it's credible but everybody jumped on me and said well you don't know that I said no I don't know that but\nIt's just as bad as it makes it when we lived in McLean is involved and you've got all these same\nPeople that tried to take Trump down involved in having this story spread yes and having the FBI investigate yes now their hands are tied they can't come up with crap\nNow yeah because this has been found out yeah their cover has been blown thanks to that ex boyfriends ... ex boyfriend may have saved down today on the day they may have saved the mid term elections and said Donald Trump's presidency honestly then you can quit facility and chaos me now [laughter]\nI Hope he served as well I Do too\nAnd and for for an innocent man if he is innocent and I believe he is to be dragged through this\nDo to the conservative tree house he has that documented\nBetter than anyone else on the Internet right now go to the conservative tree house dot com check it out it's a ridiculous name for a fantastic website I think it was almost named a ridiculous name ha ha\nSo that it could be used as an outlet to certain people not taken seriously by others\nUm but here's how he kinda closes [noise] considering all the embattled angry institutional officials former and current\nAnd considering the recently fired the OJ and FBI officials and considering the officials currently under investigation and considering the de classification request which will likely lead to the exposure of even more corruption\nCould it be that these elements wanted to do something anything to get back at the executive branch and possibly change the tide\nIf so and I think the likelihood is pretty good and doesn't\nEverything known just easily reconcile if you think is think of miss bossy forward as a tool for those idiot logs\nHit Monica ... McLean and her allies wanting to strike\nShe couldn't be the visible face for the confrontation because she was retired FBI right there would be to hobbies she would need Apache a friend who could deploy the hit on his or her by half that don't hurt or thereby have it would need to be somebody she could shape\nEasily managing guide someone who can be trusted in the same time it'd be trusting of her\nIt's quite likely missed McLean selected recruited her lifelong best friend miss bossy food\nLet me tell you this\n\n\n\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center this is W.

planning department of friends from the city and cedar city leadership said hey you know we haven't had a long range plan I think since Nineteen sixty eight I mean that is it's really been a long long tale and so what a long range plan is is is a lot of land use or what has been but today you've got to go beyond that and look at land use\nBut also qualities place um because as a millennial\nYou

own you want to win a legend but anyway since successes is eighty percent of just showing up yeah I mean president and Doug is everywhere in order for years\nI used to teach professionalism class to the college students and I\nI Would tell them I'd say look if there are certain things you can do to make it almost impossible to get fired right one of them is you don't take six days unless you're actually sick right because if they find that you took a sick day and you weren't sick they'll never oh my gosh they'll never trust movements right she only take sick days if you actually sick\nAnd you only take them if you really can't get into the office or you have a fever and don't want to get the second thing is if your ten minutes early in ten minutes late\nGet their ten minutes for your shift starts make sure you're seen check out your workstation check out what ever make sure you they're clocking right on time don't steal ten minutes from um unless they tell you it's okay to chicken early and most places let's Chicken Little early\nAnd then check it ten minutes late even if you're at the clock out on time because that's your boss is a priority make sure you go find the boss afterwards say here's what I've done anything else I Need to do today do it a couple of times we be seen ten minutes early and ten minutes late if you\nJust do those three things you will be successful I mean it's almost impossible to get fired exactly because guess why no one else is doing that no one no one short cuts you know they tried to leave early on like an every day\nShow up on time stay a few minutes late and or in in or don't take six days unless you're sick\nIt's remarkable from our ...\nAre doing a switch now that he's mentioned it to or that you run for accounts I Am actually a is one of the great city councilman we have here is right and I made some job and I think district seven probably as much as any district represents\nAll of Montgomery it it does if you're playing darts with the map of Montgomery it's the bulls eye it's the most and ... and every other district touches a an edge yeah this doesn't ... it's got\nA upper anti um well yeah it's got parts of downtown\nIt's got upper income areas it's got lower income areas that are middle class areas it's got it's got basically all the way to rural areas\nDowntown suburban a lawyer is part of the garden is oh the ... states EJ on memorial a hill would Zelda yeah\nIt is the ... is Montgomery when you think in Montgomery you think of district seven absolutely uh you don't think you know fans Glen you don't think there's a run and weird all down bone road\nOr you don't think of district one ... you don't think that we're to Atlanta highly court or which is a nice quarter I'm not knocking anyone who lives in the long road or land highway quarter but that the heart of Montgomery District seven\nI think it needs to be held by somebody with a heart for service I really do an arch has been that way absolutely er and I think I think you'll do that you've always demonstrated yourself to sort of be that way tell folks all the things you're involved in around here because it's it's a remarkable\nUm well I appreciate that just a a few um I moved back to Montgomery in two thousand nine I'm after graduating from Auburn in entrepreneurship\nAnd I'm a part of family business here we build bridges for the state of Alabama but I always kind of knew that I didn't really want to do that and so I kind of came clean to my to my dad and my brother and said hey I'm really passionate about\nPeople and and um you know the community it just different things and they were super supportive and so\nI got involved in downtown early I'm real estate development in downtown um the downtown business association or because I just showed up that you know the first thing they did was hey come to the downtown business association meeting and\nPassionate people but there are only three people there and I just showed up and the moment I walked in that door\nAnd saw their passion and they weren't downtown going I'm I just kind of took it and ran with it and it's been a community effort since then and so we just kind of created a movement um for for increasing the quality of life downtown and\nOther than that um you know been involved in in several business is in in in real estate ah started connect MGM the Facebook group that I'm really proud of\nUm it's an active group yeah very active group were doing some polling for this long range plan um but its sole purpose is to connect people to people and people resources um and and to share ideas and that's what I'm about a really a care a lot um\nBut I mean you came on here on this program pitching where you'd gone out and recruited a bunch of businesses each give a little bit of money and then you would give ... going great things run among them let me just little things like that that that really benefit of the community brought the community together gave everybody a sense of pride\nIt's easy to sit back and wine and moaning complained right it's a lot harder to roll up your sleeves and go out and find something to do that will benefit everybody that's right I Know that your sleeves are rolled up well it's obviously been working\nIt's about easy wins but it's also about sharing ideas and and you know projects and programs come and go but it's it's about pushing the NATO and ... and and getting other people that table on that didn't have a voice to begin with\n[noise]\nEverybody it's a great weather pattern for outdoor

twenty forty\nAnd I'm I'm not getting very many ... let me tell you what I feel Montgomery biggest problem is is infrastructure we have our roads an intersection and access at again around town is Fifteen Years behind\nA bit like Twenty years for an straighten parish area road they banished uh their ... and also that we have the connector which goes about where I ...\nAnd I can't hardly get around the city a squad to a level I've never seen before and I haven't heard anything in your vision or how to preserve transportation in Montgomery\nA we're no longer have a system and the ... took out the trolley cars which was mad effort and failed in I think so [noise] um\nI could we get around in this town waters your vision and what will you as a city council person try to do to help improve they very important issues and I have to work till I Would love to listen to your answer thank you very much down\nVersion or thanks rent up um that was going to ask you a question but but I think you left ... people don't realize this but at the city of Montgomery um is a hundred and sixty square miles a lot of real estate that is a ... that's a thing about a hundred and sixty square miles and so the counts\nUm you know I'm I'm personally for but if you're going to raise it let's go let's go up up or down what I have the world um you know to rent the tops point at the problem is is is\nIs one of our city but it's all across the country um 'cause infrastructures as aging out and so we need to find money uh to to to fix a lot of the stuff but let's go back to why you know when\nSomething breaks down in the Toyota plant in Japan they ask why five times so if you are in Bonn holes in ST X Y Z you know let's say it was five times but but I go back to the source of a hundred and sixty square miles if Baron and I\nAre roommates in college and it's just the two of us and we have a mansion of a house to pay for the power bill and to you know maintain it and gas and electric and clean it and all that stuff we have to say you know and I'm I don't have a suggestion on this but I mean a hundred and sixty square miles as as a big\nChunk to to monitor to to to police\nWon't know what I eat yeah one of the things we did you know Montgomery basically used in not long after I got here\nI mean not long before I get here at bell road and then it sort of went out to Taylor wrote now goes all the way up to to pike road\nAnd as we took more and more that real estate we'd ride it not increase the budget for taking care of that real estate we didn't increase the number of police officers right so you had the same number of police officers patrolling twice as much land right uh\nWe didn't we didn't increase or the funding for roads that we know own\nNeighborhood roads I mean there is like well it's only three miles east or six miles east of where it used to end yeah six miles east\nBut it's also twenty or ten miles south and so you you got like a fifty or sixty square mile block you just inherited with all those neighborhood roads all those city streets there's a lot of state I was in there but there's a lotta city roads to that need to have some attention mhm and uh\nAnd we didn't increased the capacity to pay for any of it we just we just took it all the land and there is that what you got property taxes while of it that doesn't pay for ... mount an ax is in Alabama's nothing\nAnd are saying we were were were you know sales tax um you know the online tax is going to trigger here soon but I mean we we've got a lot of decisions to make on on how to get revenue that sustainable that that isn't that we're not over taxing the maintain what we have and it goes back to if you're an empty nester\nAnd you have this huge house and you had a family four\nAnd they're the family's gone how do you maintain that\nSpeaking of taxes being increased someone pointed something up in the history of totally unrelated to Montgomery bike rode raised their property tax five meals and didn't tell anybody can do by\nThey didn't mention it say wasn't an announcement it didn't wear like make the newspaper was at the council loader it had to be I guess but I mean you would think they would at least of talked about oh we're about to raise your property tax over ten percent mhm 'cause we were forty five miles an hour at fifty that's an overt ten percent from ...\nFifty miles a lot is the last\nDay ... and that's the maximum now they they there's a discretionary five percent there that they can raise I mean five meals that they can write but they raised us in the last year and didn't mention it to anyone ... meaning every single person and bike rode now has an increase mortgage and increased property tax and no one they never mentioned it to anyone\nAnd so you know you're gonna start feeling it two days ago mhm frustrated with that I'm very frustrated with it or not that they couldn't they had every law for right to do it I get that but just the fact that they did it sort of sneak ally and didn't say anything to anybody\nYou think that at least mentioned it put it on the website or Facebook page or something oh hey we're going to take a vote on raising your property tax payers that did not wrecked Peters\nNine two to eight if you want to get into seven to nine to do I would just take one more break\nTake one

[noise]\nSweating and told me that if she had known what had what was happening to her head possibly happen\nAbsolutely tried to break into that room\nAs a quote and save whoever the person was that those party and she would contact on stories as well she sat again judge Kavanaugh has said that he does not know Julie sweat neck and has called her claims Ari nonsense apologies for my voice\nWell even work hard though it's a it's a big story that touches a lot of things I Want to ask you some questions about it we just aired her exclusive interview with a cabinet accuser who is speaking over the first time Julie sweat Nick there's a lot for people to see it in there and there are things that go\nIn different directions as often happens when you report out a story like that or you press for on the timeline of when she decided to come forward\nRight when you saw that at the top of the peace and frankly we we found it a little bit confusing because first she said that in July first she said that she had\nHeard about Brett Kavanaugh being on a short list and that happened in July you heard me ask or that was not in July she said yes I think she said that was six weeks ago but actually july's about three months ago\nAnd then she mentioned Dr Ford and being inspired by her and wanting to support her ... and ... some of what she was hearing Dr foreign say but just for the record\nThat within the September ... there is a little hazing is around\nShould aside or when she decided to come for\nNew ways you know talking about just totally fabricated him wrong here so they're going to continue owning them loose tune into me do you think they're editorializing a little bit in this\nOut as you are reporting effort to account for her second hand sources are valid leaders compare to other stories like this that you've covered [noise]\nWell that's a good question here's what I can tell you we found out about going to be fully disclose everything here we found out about this I found out about this interview on friday night on Saturday morning I had my first\nProvide us with any names of people who\nTo the parties with aren't just because we couldn't place her and the news has not since last week been able to place her in that time period at those house parties in that group of friends um there are other people coming forward as happens\nMany other stories cover for say yes I was there to a ... and and we're not discounting what she said in any way and we're just trying to do our report and make sure that there were people\nWho said she was there and to today as of today we haven't been able to find anyone who says yes I saw her in the same room with ... cat on of course judge Kavanaugh says so when they were\nKnow who I'm also I'm over allegations overlap with things we've heard from other multiple sources that has been part of the vetting of judge Kavanaugh it seems that both in her sworn statement and now in this interview she is not alleging individual misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh attacking\nShe's not sure about that yes that's right and not sure whether she she said she thought she saw him in the vicinity and then her description is that she got pushed into a room\nThat was sort of out of it and there were a number of men in that\nWon't get into details but ... says she's not sure who is there but um\nI I think we should just also say that you know we've we've been trying to verify everything she said um you know as much as they possibly can the resource of NBC News are way beyond me are as you know there are a lot of people in the schools are working on this um [noise] and again we were interested in talking to anyone else who\nMay have seen what she says she thought I should also note that she did describe not direct behavior against her her during the interview described ... against other women and she says she ... she says she deserved judge Kavanaugh behaving inappropriately push all and then against walls are you talking to them and they're doing away so\nShe's making some very serious allegations hair and I think it's it's up to the viewers to decide what they make us\nAbout what she says she saw and within this process as as more information and more accounts come out those will be Wade through the process and be seen as case so thank you\nSo in other words you're just way out you were you to put it on through or not we we came back upbringing Uber's stories but we're just put it out there now have you seen it'd be so you do that with anything about it a Democrat they're they're just going to put something out there\nIs never happen it has never ever happen matter of fact the number one stories because of the fact that they didn't have enough information for a new to Broadway is one of them or that they would do\nAnd windows getting down to the bill Clinton thing\nThey were even kind of question with the Monica Lewinsky thing should be brought out they backed off of that until they got two people to talk about it that's when they started winning with Monica Lewinsky those a period of time that they didn't win that at all those strictly a\nA Fox News type thing and then the Breitbart website which I Believe one of the first ones to open this story\nIt's a ... this was just absolutely where does that when we want to do when you get to shown Hannity from last night where um ... which is going to be talking about this you remember we're going to clip of him yesterday saying this is the person that they need to go to and he's going to get the reasoning behind it now\nI had to keep it as one gigantic piece here so we have to stop and go because shown him just talks over everybody as always but we're going to be back with the shown energy go which piece right after this quick break\n\nRatio ... three boys one race easy [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] and [noise]\nMade a willful decision to falsely accused and bought about attorney or crime name well we have to ask that question I\nAsked ... to waive lawyer client privilege so the FBI I can ask her how did the story begin hit it right now to help you didn't really make the story more elaborate I'll Try to get to the bottom of this\nGrowing Garrett let me ask you the same question and I will tell you this I learned a lot when I was in Atlanta I didn't rush to judgment a rich richer and Jill nor did I Do it and do cross nor did I Do it in Ferguson or by all of our core Cambridge police or Trayvon Martin as others did\nThere's way too much rushing to judgment in this country especially by my so called colleagues in the media [noise]\nI agree with professor Julie sweating that would appear to be in legal jeopardy and here's why perjury is a material false statement that is willful and deliberate and purposeful her sworn statement is dramatically different than what she told NBC News she would be well advised\nTo fire Michael ... the publicity seeking carnival Barker and higher\nCriminal defense attorney I predict because her story is completely disintegrating and anybody else in this case including any other accuser who made a false statement is also in legal jeopardy and it's probably a good idea\nThat the FBI launched this investigation because they'll be looking into the truthfulness and credibility never follow up on these things but you're Boatright let me go to other new details\nAs a parent and said this was if you want to stop this this is exactly what you do have said that from the very beginning you sit down with ... and you say I I'm\nI'm just going to tell you that if you buy into a FBI agent is a a phoney and start from there and then they can either side woman into two minute answer\nAnd I mean you you have all these people who basically saying that forward as it didn't happen and you're trying to prove a negative and she's saying that did happen so if you had people say it never happens used to do that if somebody's telling the truth\nAnd that's what the problem is with all of this\nSo let's keep doing\nHim a letter from a boyfriend of dog dog and I was young ward I witnessed\nDr Ford help McLean prepare for potential polygraph exam and and Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect how polygraphs work and ... McLean become familiar unless nervous about the exam Dr Ford was able to help because of her background and psychology of the way to take out of that\nOh this is incredible shine and I I agree one hundred percent with Alan Dershowitz and with ... if they were lying we should not ignoring that if they find out they were caught in perjury\nThey shouldn't be prosecuted for that because this is a man's life and his family that's had they not only that it just credit every other woman that's been through sexual assault and you can get\nAnother ... let me ask you that every single case will professor Ford she's identified an eyewitness who does not agree with her obligation or account\nI'm the same thing the story of Mrs Ramirez in the gaps in memory and the ... and even the New York times said she was asking people I don't\nBut do you was it him I'm not sure\nThat they're calling people she's calling people and this is from here it was that he couldn't be had there just thoroughly allegations out there this is a disinformation campaign with one objective in line to destroy judge Kavanaugh\nAnd God Bless him if this is ... if he had actually standing up for what he believes van and fighting\nFast ... stick in the nation will stay with him right for every now and you know at this point in time he can fight that and the people will stand up and believe him we cannot walk away from\nThe real villain of this is the American civil liberties union on board I served with honor for many years when it was the ACLU the American civil liberties union instead of the ACLU the anti civil liberties union they are now saying that suspicion is enough\nThat presumptions or to be in favor of guilt that if there's doubt you convict imagine\nIf they had said that during the McCarthy period during McCarthy period they never said when people were fired from their jobs as just a job interview they required prove by a high standard several when it comes to this they are making a fortune of money their budget has gone from twenty million two hundred and thirty million because they've abandoned civil liberties and\nHave ONE Campaign get\nTrump but on the ... games nominees on the news\nYou know do they do show which is is passionate about this and I love it and you know when you get somebody like\nErin constitutional his type person he's um that that brings no right to to this uh thing let's continue won't hear my friends\nTo join the American public are not buying there's there's a new Harris Harvard pullout sixty percent say Calvin are should be confirmed absent any corroborating evidence against him and so ... says non corroborating evidence each in our country's system\nAnd Seventy five and Feinstein is to blame for this national disgrace for withholding information weren't certainly can see on the merits of an arms out I Want to keep an open mind and our\nInformation that is this qualifying looting\nTheir own ... look at the evidence follow the ... plus the polemic absolutely\nAnd Americans I think that Sean Americans know where they know what's going on here they were trying to follow that that's why we're seeing the polls the way they are and that's why people aren't going to do out\nThere about is that ... people usually get it right I trust that we do the twenty six to eight election mad at him\nAnd I wanted to enter that no to the election depose are moving here you're saying in a boat that is actually what is the new company to the opinion dynamic research\nAnd I'd mentioned this I think Monday but this is Jody to having an effect in Arizona for example mix Sally is moving is having a tremendous uh back on the high camp and a hot\n...

Lindsey Graham felt when he did that outburst of this is the most despicable thing I've seen in politics so now you take what can be a reasonable position by senator tester in Montana that I don't think he's right for the court because of the Fourth Amendment blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd it's now gone from no you're just part of this party that's drawing this man's or the mud and its effect well I think it's coloring a local races in a way that could have been about other issues when I think his Fourth Amendment argument is a week when\nTo do and then it may pay had if he had a long history of of things that would be different I just don't see that history out here you know shown any jury but one they're more show will be back right after this\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean I\n\n\n\nYou're [noise]\nVegas ham batted fraud\nAnd then all of our way is currently our what grade now enjoy gardening\nFree to say on the river regions most trusted voice huge dog ... wanna bam WABC the\nIf you had a pool you know about needing help with it from time to time I found that company for you begun pulled survey\nThere are regal chemical dealer they've been in business for forty years regal chemical or the very top of the line with his family owned by their son do well they handle all repair such as ...

Christian fish are at the latest from Capitol Hill for us this morning Christine right now and you're trying to track down one of the most critical swing senators in this confirmation process\nYeah Sandra also one of the most elusive Republican Senator Susan Collins has been keeping a very low\nThis week he's been the subject at a very intense pressure campaign there have been huge protests\nOutside her send it off and she's been spending most of our time in her hideaway office that's\nWhy at the place where the press can't reach her so that's why you see all of these cameras lined up outside the hearing room we all know that senator Collins is the chairwoman of this committee that's going to be a hearing at nine thirty so everybody is lined up hoping to grab\nHer and ask her questions questions when she lost in this room and just about thirty minutes and he's going to be asked about where she stands\nThe judge cabin although she's also likely going to be asked about what she thought about what President Trump said at\nThat rally last night you know in other critical swing vote here Republican Senator Jeff flake called those comments appalling so there are a lot of questions about you know is what President Trump said last night if that could have a real impact on how these three critical Republican Senator Flake Collins and Murkowski\nOn how they vote now in terms of timing of course all of this hinges on when the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell filed co church so far he hasn't done it he said he wants to do it or\nHave this vote by the end of the week so the very earliest that he could file cloture would be today that would push a confirmation vote the earliest\nAnd let me explain to the audience what this is I use this for my financial practice all the time it's going to the family limited partnership\nAnd what happens is the dad is the operating general partner and the kids don't Trump and his brother and his sister were the the limited partners or their\nSo he can give to them or they can buy from him shares into the family limited partnership I've been part of one of these before and you get a discount on it so then when something happens to the father those phones then go to the limited partner because the general partner is no longer there\nAnd using this word or that they are\nA sham attacks dodge let me tell you the people who have money don't like to pay taxes and what they do is that her people like me and him attorneys did not do that\nMy biggest client that I've got has a family limited partnership why because we used to just ... years ago and it's going to several generations already or to to\nTo ... series so far so this this whole notion is crazy now to the hell they found that documents is what they did is you have to follow your family limited partnership\nPapers they implied that they were doing looking at tax records\nThey may have been looking at tax records of the fathers somehow but I Do know they got hold of the family limited partnership papers because you have to follow them\nWell the thing about paying taxes is pretty simple\nOr the more money you make more punitive it becomes therefore you start looking for ways to keep the money that you've earned\nWhat's on reasonable about\nThis what you do I mean it's it's not a tax dodge what you're doing is you're taking advantage of tax code is that attack right up it's not you're not doing anything illegal\nYou know family family limited partnership has been tested time and time again most of the ones that we get involved in we actually get the IRS and so this is what we're doing any problems with this and they\nDon't you think that's what the Kennedy family has\nBeen asked to you how about Bloomberg you anything Bloomberg who was giving to Democrats lifting why do you think he's paying taxes as if he is not a corporation and taking dividends he's well Warren Buffett does the exact same thing he takes about ... percent David it\nYes he's in fact that's why he's able to say that that is a secretary pays a higher effective tax rate than he does is because he's pulling it into the ... which was at what temperature ...\nWell now we're now it depends on what bracket you're in but it's the highest can be as twenty to Brazil okay but there you go do it this way my company has built I I Am a corporation and I take a dip it in a corporation\nAnybody that starts making any money is going to find somebody like you and in order to try to preserve what's your building up\nAbsolutely and and this is the way the media is presenting this is outrageous and what they should do is get the L O M tax attorney that they have on staff somewhere and bring them in and talk to him but no they don't do that\nI was gonna say this is a perfect example of why you can't trust the media anymore yup\nLet me play the ... of American news whom own tax fraud clip number three\nOn I got her all the White House or you were reacting on the New York times reported alleged tax evasion during the Nineteen nineties about an eight page spread on that today Kevin\n[noise] yeah um you know I talked to White House officials every morning just to make sure that not not only on top of what's happening today but what's coming down the line and they say simply speaking are you kidding me\nOh this is what the New York times does uh they've also been quite frankly critical of the Washington Post for their reporting on the Trump Administration this phase however I think it's fair to say is extensive\nEight unpack so number of examples of the president and his father or they allege talking about the time so you're using advantages and the tax system to reduce their liabilities critically the times suggest possible fraud\nBut later they do know that many of the moves made by the trumps were in fact lawful let me share statement this from Sarah Sanders she said Fred Trump\nHas been gone for nearly Twenty years and it's sad to witness is misleading attack against the Trump family by the failing New York times many decades ago the IRS reviewed and signed off on these transactions New York times and other media outlets credibility with the American people is that an all time low because\nThey're consumed with attacking the president and his family twenty four seven\nInstead of reporting the news no official events all the

I Am a curve resident of California\nI first met Christine ... now Dr ... Ford in Nineteen eighty nine or Nineteen Ninety in California [noise]\nFrom Nineteen Ninety two through Nineteen Ninety One I was just friends with Ford from approximately Nineteen Ninety two to Nineteen Ninety eight I was in a relationship with Dr Ford I found her truthful and maintain no animus towards her\nDuring our time dating Dr Ford never brought up anything regarding her experience as a victim of sexual assault harassment or misconduct Dr Ford never mention Brett Kavanaugh\nDuring some of the time we were dating doctor for live with Monica ... McLean who I understood to be her lifelong best friend during that time it was my understanding that McLean was\nInterviewing for jobs at the FBI and the U.S attorney's office I Witness Dr Ford help clean prepare for a potential polygraph exam\nDr Ford explained in detail what to expect how polygraphs worked and help the claim become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nDr Ford was able to help because of her background in psychology\nDarker forwarded I live together while we were dating and stayed together in a long distance relationship when Dr Ford and move to Hawaii sometime around Nineteen Ninety eight although I Am not sure of the particular here and it might have been a bit earlier or later\nWhile visiting forward in Hawaii we traveled around the Hawaiian Islands including one time on a propeller plane\nDr Ford never indicated that fear of flying to the best of my recollection Dr Ford never express the fear of close quarters tight spaces are places with only one exit I assist the Dr Ford with finding a place to live in redacted California\nShe ended up living in a very small five hundred square foot house with one door despite trying to maintain a long distance relationship I ended the relationship once I discovered that Dr Ford was unfaithful while living in Hawaii\nAfter the break up I took her off the credit card we share but nearly one year later I noticed Dr Ford had been charging the card in charge about six hundred dollars worth of merchandise\nWhen confronted Dr Ford said she did not use the card but later admitted to the use after I threaten to involve fraud prevention\nI didn't speak again to Dr Ford until about two thousand to one for contacted me briefly after that I hadn't thought much about her until I saw her story in the Washington Post on Sunday September sixteenth twenty eight team\nI Do not want to become involved in this process or current investigation but wanted to be truthful about what I Know\nSign X yeah so she had a friend that was going to be working for a U.S attorneys up as possibly FBI and\nMonica McLean McLean Monica monthly\nAnd she was going to to make sure she could pass the the polygraph test she briefed on how to do it and he was at a witness at that\nIt's also in Jersey just back to the the fear of you know flying or tight close quarters are tied spaces are part of me thinks of that was the lawyers for his lawyers making up excuses ... they were trying to do the stall and\nFear of flying and you're trying to give them a little cover but she finds all over the place yeah oh so you remember she says she and her two doors to her house road that's what a precipitated the uh\nThe a therapy session but she wanted to doors when they re modeling or oh whether their husband\nThe federal dollars which is also the website that you're looking at now came out with last week no last week that the second door is actually an addition that they ended um so they could rent\nSpace to folks are working in Silicon valley particularly Google\nThat makes perfect sense so it was not two doors so you can just ... right\nI haven't seen any other outlets take their story\nBut see this lady is in the ... I Wish they would have it in this one of the very beginning were so we're just as I said go send somebody in there and go talk to him and get her own record and just start out the conversation would you do know that bind to the FBI or say federal events\nAnd so how about this so you remember the attorney came over the suggestion you go to go do a polygraph so she said\nBut she probably said something along the lines are but I think I can pass a polygraph test knowing that she knew how to pass would probably grab chairs that'd be absolutely believe in your mind that that is exactly what happened\nThat you believe is so deeply you're not showing it as a negative that a major there that is absolutely major because the only thing they really gave her credit ... was a polygraph test that was the only thing\nEverything else totally fell apart out they interview were\nBecause if they don't and they don't and again the way to stop people from doing this in the future is to take the people who did it now and they're doing it now in ... it has only way to do it there's nobody credible or mirrors are not credible\nA Swiss nuke is not credible\nAnd I've now reading this I don't think Ford is old credible I've always used the notion that she believed as something happened to her and she believed it was\nRick governor yeah I think now what happened is what exactly what I said\nOh she does she took something that happened and she could talk about that oh she does exchange input in break our nose name and they're better than it was a purpose behind that new show Ninety three where do you think Ninety three but one that Marcia we'll be back credit for this or\n\nOr a demo ratio\nOh um oh\n\nOh\nWhoa whoa\nWhoa whoa whoa\nWhoa whoa whoa\nIn a play that for you and I'm I'm doing this so you can go to see how ridiculous is hoping is that no they really come across with food they're they're just panicked ...\nTo ... they'll do anything to try to shop to service keep doing it again it was ... was it up\nAnd what you're told our producers is it there is one problem you know because he testified they didn't drink too much and it would never blacked out\nAnd then they want to show a series of incidents with shows people thought he didn't drink too much and he did blackout how do you prove someone didn't remember something thirty three four years ago but that's what they're trying to show that they didn't tell the truth\nRight well you can't show something did or didn't especially happened thirty six years ago so what they're left with is accusing him of lying to the Senate and that's really all they can do now is try and say well some people are led you were a blackout drunk you say you weren't a blackout drunk and that means we can't trust you but\nIt's happening on both sides because now you have Dr fourth ex boyfriend is cutting out things she's lying and she lied and during the here and get the whole situation has gotten so ugly I have not you know I followed Supreme Court confirmation for decades and\nI have never seen anything like that even the Clarence Thomas hearings and don't come close to what's happening here and you're right both sides are trying to ... discredit everyone\n... invasion the extent that they are going to open okay so ah which got the uh current governor of Florida who is also a I'm a candidate for us sooner running against Bill Nelson is going to be talking and he was asked in a debate about cabinet and\nFiery debate and a at a cabinet did come up\nAnd at one point Mr Nelson's senator Nelson said a given his emotional testimony last week he does not fit to serve on the Supreme Court you like what's going on in the seats in the Jerry Springer show it is in last night's debate is a great example why we need term limits\nA senator Nelson did have one thing he could say hey accomplish he's been in office since Richard Nixon was president had nothing to head nothing he can say this go back to the judge capital so Sara Nelson has never met with him\nRight he said before he was even nominate he would be against anybody from came up with\nThis or it's a circus up there's a Springer ... at the Jerry Springer show these guy Dr Ford in church have aren't just pawns in some game up there are between the two parties so he needs to be confirmed\nA he's got a great a track record and I can I continue to support him\nThat's a good stand on a scotch part and if you if you make it about the vote own here\nThan that I think you've got a winning combination with that particular somebody that is the ... so how do you go to buy as we're Scott so was it was going to continue going into it'd be talking about Nelson and\nKind of what some of the things that knows and say goes ages I ripped up Rick Scott and Scott didn't just sit back\nWhen when you were talking about how was senator Nelson has been in DC too long he turned around and said look Rick Scott\nIs a liar and he's got a bunch of conflicts of interest in his strategy is simply to change the subject anytime anything tough comes up the or you can go to Florida facts dot org and get all the information but here's here's a guy that's been in office for all this time I put my assets and blind trust\nI I made my money in business he's made his money in politics taping his assets and a blind trust he's been paid over four million dollars\nAnd you know in in his job as a politician that's how he doesn't get rich by being a politician in this country so we talked about the facts we talked about issues education immigration Cuba I had I had a lady on there that after he supported ... a piece on policy to Raul Castro a murder of American citizen\nI said I said this show and this lady was attacked by machete

be doing this battle of sorts are sort of\nHalloween movie tournament scary movies mostly some classes slasher film summer goes movies\nThings that come on October we've got a few Stephen king's and hear him alone and he's got a few on hair and we're just trying to put things together is no real strict\nRules but we have twenty movies first I was going to just do straight sixteen but ... you had a list of like Twenty one or so you had ended up being twenty one gets the slasher is and you just regular ones from one\nI've I've tried to make it fair so I went into the Internet and I are just put in\nI Want to bracket for twenty different items in this case twenty movies twenty films and so it came up with a little broken bracket here so what we're actually doing the died is the bubble rattled where to get into the actual dance we've got a few people that have by weeks\nThis week a few movies with ... just already made it\nAnd to make this interesting we put some good movies for tonight so tonight we have the conjuring\nOr surging ghost is the thing versus it\nWho I Am one family had a good one because they're both will get into it will get into those Bones Are kind of the same type of movie we have the shining classic against ... ooh which is actually I don't know that's going to be a good fight there and then scream\nClassic nineties goes faster yeah\nAgainst the avenue bill for the night at the remake Seventy nine Seventy I got to do or in the same thing goes for the thing not the remake the eighties\nRemake of the things you know unfortunately oh so if you want to go and comment on my book faces page feel free we are tracking that as we speak but also feel free to call in will come to take this each matchup one at a time\nSo if you want to call in to seven to nine to to it so you want to start off with number one here\nThe conjuring and Thirteen Ghosts\n... ghost movie and ghost movies seem to Thirteen Ghosts doesn't seem like the same kind of goes movie is the ... it's not paranormal you're actually see the monsters they're you know Thirteen Ghosts is Thirteen Ghosts conjuring\nThat's where the five out while I appreciate that getting back on topic ... thank you so much with a lot by president there okay\nSo you're going with it if it's between we're now in the second battle and then after this will have to hit a break\nBut Thirteen Ghosts has moved ahead that said and done\nWhere you're now have this match up between the thing and it yes it's a new at the one that did that smash the box office last year and the clown his name is penny why any wise is free came in as I Will get penny wise that\nWould penny wise isn't always a clown he's a big giant spiders right Benny wise is a shape shift gr ... much like the alien\nAnd the thing\nIs a good monster right that is a good monster so I don't know I'm I'm put myself into this one my vote is the thing because I think it's more classic I think I'm OK\nNow old lady Hayes I Know and you're not friends and family and I and the two thousands Seventeen was amazing\nAnd I want to agree with their their ... old TV movie crap with new stuff I don't care Mueller jaded 'cause you sold the original ones or whatever the new ones really good\nAnd shot really well and just done in the style and I think is good but if I'm deciding between the thing and it I'm going with I Want to watch the thing [laughter]\nThey didn't happily clean the bathroom [noise] forgot to use it sure was high\nPeriod and period known period with period you period boroughs period [laughter]\nThis is a fax messages from Emily serious I Love him ...\nI'm Sorry but that's how I feel okay let's go to the let's look on line let's see what people are out there\nOkay we have one for the thing we have to for the thing we have ... one for it to for at a three for the thing\nThree for it for for it for for the thing oh it is five for the thing\nSix or the thing it's a tie\nOn line right now who believes\nUnless there's some updates but okay\nMy vote is the thing that's what I put for because you know what I don't like clams really I don't like clowns\nMy mom got me I'm a Christmas present one time it was a a life ... life size Chuck E. ... yeah I had I think forever and I worked at a bar and I used to take it to the bar with me and hang it up and one of the bartenders deathly afraid of clowns you turn around and see that\nBut I can be overruled there's Chad paying just you know he said it it just chimed any must be listening oh no I can be overruled but if it's between the thing is what are you going with Seth I'm going with thing\nOkay Eric I [noise]\nMm\nSee here's the thing ladies and gentleman was bringing some behind the scenes drama his fiance is ill all lower Emily have old lady Hayes is texting theory is silly [laughter] right [laughter]\nYou know and I get I'm In the group that\nAin't cooking\nFor you know I guess that was directed at me But Eric better choose wisely\nOh wow and she's\nHappily leading our master bath [laughter] and that was an old tech so I'm thinking the thing is the way to go Seth is thinking the thing right now the edge on line is towards it by one or two what say you Eric\nI I have yet to see the new yet\nUm\nBut based off of\nMy experience\nI'm going to go with it\nOkay\nI ... what what I have ... the parts that I have seen of the new yet a trailers and then checking it out\nUm\nI I I'd go with it it's for me it's scarier\nOkay fair enough and also there's this Halloween and if you really think about the things that I'm being self critical here\nThe thing is more of a sigh fiber\nWhich got whore elements\nAgree I'd Neal men monitor is something one of the best monsters ever\nBeing an alien shape shift or though right last ... would in my mind would take it to the the ...\nJust put us over on the it on it we got another ... from ms and star okay Angie star says it you know right when we're going with it [noise]\nBecause it's more technically a Halloween horror movie and a traditional sense is the thing I think is the movie I Would prefer to watch on any given day but maybe if it's cause it's Halloween season yeah\nIt's over the top so it is a winning and winning it is the winner All right let's move this for hair\n... oh and look at this folks it will be going up against Saul\nWho in the next time around we're not doing that on tonight [noise] but it will be going up against solve but we're already seeing like a little bit coming together a later in the show will be doing the shining verse cheaper screen first and screen versus the avenue the horror but we already have a son\nI Believe next week all set now\nWhat will be the battles next week we will have Thirteen Ghosts which one tonight against nine of the living dead ooh pet cemetery against child's play off\nIt versus all\nDo we mean to be able to do we're leaving out army at ... ... well we've got to get a big one is the evil dead against the house of thousand courts as a ... so that will be next week so that'll be all the ban next week and they'll be moving forward\nBut um you know pet cemetery that movie is going to be tough to talk about that one of the ... one I ever saw in theaters estimates and my mom took it took me took it took me to go see it in theaters yeah\nAnd that's why I Am home [laughter] we talked about this well in the\nChild's play always freak me out as a kid chunky Truckee hey idle men but now I'm like as an adult truck he's hilarious yeah oh he's awesome yeah right we won't get to that battle next week but uh it's something about\nLike it's in the shining which we're going to talk about a second uh I'm having trouble and by the way folks because I haven't had any tobacco\nAll day and I feel like I'm about to ... snap\nLike for no damn good reason like I Love you both but stop looking at me [laughter]\nHa ha offering him a word\nBut anyway there's something freaky about like where it's like in the shining the children the little girls ran light or like your pet the idea of a beloved pet turning on new coach or a doll or yeah like jet in particular pets\nThat shouldn't be haunting you shouldn't be like essentially animals zombies it's not cool pet cemetery right that shouldn't be it should be healthy\n[laughter] that should be healthy they should be alive they should be there to comfort you as you watched that scary flick\nAnd that's why the keep your pets healthy to go see trees over for healthy pets on the Atlanta highway I'm proud of Baron he tried the chicken crack and said it was good yeah he tried to himself and what we mean by chicken crack as it is for your dog\nAnd he says good it's human quality that's how good it is what you're ... it's essentially chicken jerky but it's so good your dog will treat it like crack me like master master give me some more that chicken cracked and I hear master master if I might be the puppet here but here the master but I don't know ah\nGive me some of the turkey crack too because I heard they you know Joe ... show they're going to have turkey crack along with the chicken but really the idea of folks at for healthy pets as you want to have\nHigh quality all natural food going to your pet and going into your pet system because if you are feeding them sort of bottom of the barrel bargain meal you have a prize is yeah when it comes out\nIt's even worse it's going to be terrible for them that's why ... over for healthy pets is taking the time to look after her own pads her cats\nOr dogs you can get them excited with like your dogs the chicken cracker meow want us some catnip for years\nNow that all of a feeling you know it's wonderful I Love the packaging\nBut also just high quality everyday meals over and for healthy pets it's on again Atlanta highway the village each shopping center oh skate have been used to be the same side of Atlanta highways were Wagner is\nJust stopped by there or you can visit them for healthy pets online dot com for healthy pets on the line dot com and uh\nI got to get back over there just to hang out because there's like the dogs and cats that the cat named mouse just has me every time you and it's like friends and families our over there for all the pets to stop by folks till Theresa Joey said Hi well coming up after this\nWell and so here's my ideal is that any little poorer doesn't have as good a rating and scream but look people in my two friends here in Studio\nAre saying\nThat and he's a horse better than scream\nYeah\nThat's that's the way um I I wrote down it as far as scary movie goes whore is scarier than okay and also let's keep in mind whoever wins this battle this match up is going on to face nightmare on elm street\nSo I'm going to say that's a good manager Amityville or it is to make it official let's make it a winning\n... or is the winner of hay and plus in the remake Ryan Reynolds was in it\nWhat it was really he was in the remake sexy Canadian yeah man two guys girl in a piece place [laughter]\nOh whoa Josh Reagan's got some feedback here a hash tag nostalgia [laughter] that's what we're doing [laughter] see I Would have normally if I'm taking the movie I Would pick screen but you know I can\nI can defer to other people that man is the ... I think for nist Algeria and I do like the\nThe self aware that it's a slasher flick that the guy who's the slasher and it is making jokes about slasher fit flicks like the legal universe it exists in is the same universe that friday and Jason and Michael Meyers exist\nLike then so there's references to all those movies or sometimes you get in like other movies like lung is a whole other different type of universe I like when it's in the world the pop culture series that I Love like dead pool and other comedies I Will acknowledge\nSex and you might live as friends of the rules yeah don't smoke pot uh-huh don't have a yeah and don't open the door while I'm going to\nDie [laughter] I'm gonna die oh I just didn't [laughter]\nSo much trouble weighed as Kevin Bacon or what was it a friday thirteenth I think it was like pork to one or something he had sex he smoked pot and then he caught a a\nAn arrow to the neck Mm yeah good well having sex yeah\nMhm that's a terrible way to go I mean we covered that what a tally in playboy oh yeah who is a potential is up to six thousand women and the mayor of his town called him a legend of the night after and fast\nCharging overnight normally we say that to not raw too but they're like can you imagine if\nThere were some light well known playboy here in Montgomery, Alabama that mayor Todd Strange will put out like a a statement saying he was a legend of the night [laughter] our\nOnly you know I'm Wondering why am I Am not a legend the legend of the hair of laughing and the wind\nAs he goes to the next call him a ... man yeah I'm I Am a ... I think temperamental Lee a chick ... scream\n[laughter] [laughter]\nAnyway\nTime for next match I'm One of the night final one of the night and things will become clearer now in that bracket and the tournament where we'll go after this choice but we have the shining\n... from for eighties Nineteen eighty Brian mid eighties I think yeah the shining Nineteen eighty verse two thousand ones cheaper ...\nPer se [noise] man for those who don't know ... ... more iconic think Uber's group presided like Justin Long and some other\n... I Can't remember the actresses name but their driver ... are there are countries or how you know kind of desolate and like or in the middle of nowhere\nAnd they see some random dude throwing something in like off the side of the road riots\nIn uh it's behind a building and it's like a tunnel and he's throwing something that looks like about end of the time yeah and then they get all nosy ... all they get they investigate no need for it and the whole\nWell that's just dumb now why don't open the door [laughter] All right\nAnd the monster is the reason I Love that movie so much that it's a very unique monster and I mean he really is a freaking monster and you see him and he's ... he's just something that doesn't happen much you know I mean he wakes up every twenty nine years to feed\nAnd I mean he'd like breeze through his nose he smells like he he could smell you and he'll be like ooh is ... good and then eventually hit wind when you said\nHe wakes up every ... ideas to the denial of a sudden urge for tobacco [laughter]\nBecause it's time to be at least let me put some tobacco in my mouth forty in your car [laughter]\nI Love I Love\nThe part in deeper keepers were there they they end up\nDeciphering the license plate all\nGood eating you thought it was eating you when it's be eating you know beating you oh okay\nI learned something new every day because I always thought beating you a good ...\nSecret I'm reading or online feedback here and uh we're getting a lot for the shining the shining it's going pretty strong that thing\nYes\nAnd that was that was something new 'cause I mean like the thing it was set in winter now okay but here's here's the your your father is the one name Rob mhm yeah I hear already said that scream as a chick fillet I get [laughter]\nHe is now saying your father is and I'm sure I'll meet him at the wedding [laughter] it's great mailed me this weekend okay oh man it's with the ... yeah yeah uh uh he's saying that the shining as a comedy yeah [laughter]\nI might as well by Eric\nHangs out with me I don't I don't I remember the shining and I won't say that I won't go that far I'm In from the tax I got earlier I'll probably\nBe scolded when I get home that sure [laughter] but uh the mysteries okay\nThe text I got it was the thing about the shining is that there's this line blurred between him losing his mind and the spirits is he just going crazy and spirits take advantage of that or do the spirits that start working on him and drive him to insanity\n... that is that's ... that's a little of both I think it's really good actually so\nI don't remember it well enough to go off of that it was a he was already kind of nuts and then they got stuck in the hotel because of the snow yeah and then due to circumstances\nBeyond his control and some that he could control I think the ghost just help push something that was already there roar and because in the photo there's a photo of a a back in the thirties or whatever of the hotel and at the end of the movie he's in the photo\nSee I I have to go personally but the shining because of these arrays like there's more there's more psychology to the movie that leaves things open for more interpretation words were cheaper scrapers it's kinda like yeah really bad as monster wants to feast on human flesh\nAnd but it's Kenny are straightforward like I wouldn't even put it up there that high with other slasher fit flicks I put scream above ...\nThat should have it it would just had the ... and it's only got a six point two wars the shining as an eight point four at all okay\nAnd and the uh the Internet is saying the shining also it is pretty much you know there's the fans you scrape for but I think because Emily put that very well she did how the movie the shining as I don't know I think I like and this gets kind of his heart and more the discussion will go\nIn the next few weeks ... days because well I haven't made the decision yet I'm lean towards the shining\nAnybody want to protest the shining winning and keep the mind\nWhether it's the shining or deeper scrapers\nIt will be facing\nThe winner of this matchup Halloween\nOoh\nAnd one's a good\nOpponent for Halloween\nSee I've already decided mine I'm going with cheaper scrapers okay that's that's the make your case of ... over the shining specifically okay it\nFor me it's always going to be a monster over a paranormal or or ghosts and\n... is not a ghost [laughter] well no but the the the bad the bad guy in the movie is the ghosts\nMm uh I don't believe in goes wrong I don't either oil yeah but I I don't know I guess I just I'm more of a firm believer of not not\nBelieving go [laughter] I don't believe in goes even fictional [laughter] but I", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Coosada", "day": "03"}
