that the people there are now who are familiar with what's going on that there have been a culture of people who've vanished\nA would have the same kind of feelings would be concerned about it Karen thank you for sharing that you might want to leave your information with ah with the Donna our call screener tonight and I'm\nDavid might want to talk to you but I appreciate calling in and sharing that with us we're going west of the Rockies Roger in Bellevue, Washington Hi Roger\nAnd it's a thank you George a mission that um I wanted the a related story to a Mr ... is a about a missing people uh in the Bellingham uh area of a Washington state\nUh that uh over several years at least a recent\nAnd in the past uh have turned up missing a and a later on some of their body parts and mainly their feet have shown up in the\nIn a water\nAre in different areas and ah [noise]\nIn since uh during that time period uh my wife and I had a\nHad the misfortune of having a ... a missing son and he was a very well trained a boy scout and we figured that the you know the uh since it's been two years now a\nA you know a ... a well nothing ... nothing has turned up in terms of evidence or anything like that so the ah local law enforcement closed the case and uh and because he's an adult we can't go forward with it because of his wife\nAnd a and so we're we've been kind of stuck with that but I wanted to find out if I'm Mr a prices are being aware of this a phenomenon of a\nOf the feet a issue and uh it's it's been a well publicized in newspapers and and over there [laughter]\nYeah I mean I'm sure you've heard of that and uh you know if you wanted to try to contact them we have a we have links on the coast to coast website his website is can am missing dot com that's how you reach a days I I Know he knows about the defeat story because it was so widely publicized but your son\nI'm One of the circumstances where did that happen and when\nOkay or if it happened in Bellingham and it happened or just on the outskirts of town and\nUh he basically what happened a ... and this happened two years ago October uh\nHe uh he had\nLeft home and uh we believe that maybe there may have been some friction at home but the youth left home and he got a new vehicle and evidently it ran out of gas and uh and didn't have any money to get gas so he took up walking\nAnd he tried to call him and his wife back in a that was the last that they had heard from him a ... when he had stated that it's going to have died and he was lost and lost in the woods somewhere\nAnd couldn't find its way out in the end and then we had a a massive search uh for the next two days in a row with a with a law enforcement we also had a\nHad helicopters they had a sad or drones are I mean they covered a area over ten mile stretch and nothing at all showed that period and uh we were just show a broken over that uh\nAnd uh and since then uh I have actually personally myself I have called in and talk to a few times to some of the people that they actually investigated on it\nAnd they just basically told me that uh that they were a a ... ... they were basically are held by the laws of the state in and of course the\nThe wife uh\nUh that uh any information given out the would be specifically only given to her and uh and that the parents couldn't find out anything you know after that so\nThat you had read why yeah I'd like to try to uh maybe a get a shot at a you know talking to David this brightest and\nShe would uh see what he thinks\nI I Would suggest you try that website that okay that is but also you can leave your name and number with Donna and uh I'll pass on to Dave I'm that's a\nThat's a rough story to to uh tell on the radio I'm sure I thank you for sharing it with us and you know I can imagine that that's a whole never going to be right and the fact that you just don't know it was just a is a brutal\nA thank you Roger thanks for calling it will try to get one more call in before we go to a break a Joe in Long Island on the east of the Rockies Bonnie Hi Joe Hi\nGeorge ah I did a couple of seasonal gigs for two national parks a\nGlacier in the valley in Alaska and one thing I Would say a specially looking at the rally the infrastructure of the park is very limited\nUh they have like a road that goes to mount McKinley that ... is winding mountain road that bus it can take a bus\nNo real hiking trails\nAnd if he'd go off the uh\nThose roads like the four they wouldn't be bad for hiking so\nI I I Would say it and I will correlate the ... glacier ah they really on the plate shows how treacherous a trail could be for example in glacier it would be on wages on actual trials that are like twenty miles trails for like two three four miles\nSo I I think a lot can do wrong uh and uh you know if someone was like say by themselves and they hurt their ankle and couldn't proceed uh then I don't know anything can happen with the wild animals from the one thing now I don't think\nWhat's happening is some sort of Charles Manson group that are looking to just fine isolated hikers and do something with them I never really got the impression although I read that like criminals would hide out in Yellowstone for example I don't think that people go to those parks to like\nA just a pounce on someone that's an isolated hiker so law\nThis is happening [noise] uh but uh I I think what David Sanger about the national parks is very little supervision people who are\nAre you know there are just off on their own to a degree and I've done that including myself or any number of times where something happened on a trial uh nobody would have no where I was [noise]\nAnd uh one more thing on that is my Ramon theory is what you said about the birds are sloping down I did see a Glacier National park like these tiny birds but they almost right on the ground I felt what does it look like something from Jurassic Park\nFlight to wander effects or a moat right there is some sort of\n... historic bird that might be out there\nBut that's my coast to coast theory [noise]\nUm you know the idea that they're criminals in the national parks national forest I think that's probably true you know they're criminals pretty much everywhere that humans go uh in addition you have a lot of people who grow grow weed out there in in the wilderness places and uh and would do anything to protect it and um\nYou know but those kinds of cases are generally weeded out of the day but database if we're talking about people who vanished I'm under very strange and specific kinds of circumstances\nAnd there was no tracks there was no indication that people are around a ... they can vanish within a few feet of their family members or the people that are hiking wet so it's very weird and I don't think that the criminals being out there could explain\n... pretty much any of the cases that are a boiled down and David ... books but I appreciate that thought or we're going to take a break now and there's a lot of folks on the phone lines of we'll get to as many of your calls as we can I noticed a couple of folks have their own stories with a encounters strange and counters in the woods and\nYou know it's been a while since I've been hiking out in in the wilderness areas but um\nBut I can understand how the elements can can sort of close in on you a little bit and uh it gets pretty creepy out there sometimes the or we're going to go to the break the ... take us into the break and we'll be right back\n[noise]\n\nI don't know anything about that specific a creature or creature report but I Do know that uh the ac I'm a I'm area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff for a very long time\nOr the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena Utah spend some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories from the locals including the tribe\nAnd had reported the number of different kinds of creatures it's always been a UFO hotspot or at least for the last fifty or so years so there's a lot of weird stuff concentrated in the area you're discussing uh but no I hadn't heard the story about the\nThe um things pulling people out of their sleeping bags that room rock lake thanks for sharing that do appreciate it we're going to go east of the Rockies to Roy in Youngstown, Ohio morning Roy\nHow you doing All right what's on your mind\nHey um I remember um put this evening or are you guys were talking about a David ... you're talking about ...\n... and uh and I literally stood up and said that it and I pointed at the radio because I read all the books I've read all of the four one one books I've read the skin ... book\nAnd I've been following this thing for some time but for several years or\n... was the ... when you guys were talking about that all kinds of things started to come to mind a rich lived a certain number of uh disappearances\nA lot of disappearances happened on or near a rich life and I just couldn't walk her ranch that's on a rich like\nUh let's see uh a hundred percent success rate\nEvery time an individual is taken no one ever sees him being taken\nOver those getting worker ranch we're dealing with with with something that is highly intelligent and it knows when ... somebody's on the property or on around is just to me I'm just saying to me uh in my opinion I think that you know the the skin Walker ranch uh\nIs very close to uh the\nThe phenomenon turn around and go for one one\nWell I you know I think there are some similarities and that they it is whatever it is it seems to be intelligent and it seems to know what people are doing before they do it themselves and it's still the that's for sure the only difference is there at skin Walker to my knowledge no one has disappeared animals have dealt they're here but not quite ... you\nThere has not been any people are saying but there's been a you know yeah I mean that's the other side that we have had animals missing but then we've also had mutilation\nAh when people have gone missing there's been no explanation of um gouge marks on them other than she craves for things like that no no kind of like probing or or something and then any land with two when you read a function story and things like that\nBut that that doesn't fit but as far as a rich lines go um and uh and the high intelligent or is it\nA hundred percent success rate or no one ever sees a that that to me is uh some goods from our share\nOf thanks thanks for sharing your impressions with us that's a lot to chew on appreciate your calling in we're going to go to the wild card line Mario in San Antonio Texas\nOr he has a ... he wants to tell us about welcome\nWelcome to generate a secret for taking my call I wanted to remind me my experience a here at a park in San Antonio in which they added another ten miles of bike trail connect a couple of parks\nAnd um this wooded area where even do was they light at the time almost literally mean my wife were using them by going down to turn on the course I was a little ahead of her ... and ah we've got straight as one area where it got kind of dark even do it with their life but it was sold one is that it was the\nSun sunlight shining through as much as I started kind of got kind of a dark in that area and when I stopped to think well my wife was that I noticed some kind of something just\nStaring at it and it was like on on the stump and they look more like a bird or put a you know you never know I mean it's kind of felt like it was like seven feet tall it's the\n... and just everything on the stump just a staring at me and my wife when chair broached a mean looking at something cheated and we've kind of look kind of stunned that each other and I said that you see that and she's like yeah\nSo when they saw was just awesome we just saw some bad going to be flying away but the wingspan was so large that one of them\nIt wasn't like a regular bird you know what I mean we have dogs and I'm going to send all kinds of stuff but not in a park nearby but this is a heavy area would it\nBe tweeting parks where they had made a bike trail and that's all it is and so I didn't want to share my story because I Know we didn't report it to know pop stores or any park rangers anything well\nWhy don't we didn't have no evidence of too it's kinda hard to believe that bird could be that big and we were just two people just riding bikes that not a [noise] a lie down some kind of reporting about something that we just saw\nSo a ... you said this thing is seven feet tall did it have just like a regular bird's face or or do you remember what coloring on the ... all you saw\nWas kind of like ah maybe some thing going his eyes kind of glowing just like if you just said a beer in the dark Cold War or something like that new new staring at you but you you couldn't just seem like a form of shape\nBut you could really chilling exact details they especially when there was an that this that and I think the first thing you you I Know what is what's the sense that something was staring at me and that's why that's sort of made me up\nAnd whatnot 'cause my wife and I'm looking at it and I look\nAt that point so I have some second she turned around and just try to fly away so I couldn't really tell a bad like hands arms of the details all I knew was huge because we used to have chickens in and do stuff like that it was nothing like that\nA Mario thanks for sure and that's\nThe specific detail that you had on that a while that's quite an experience uh Jason in Portland, Oregon has inexperienced to share with us facing welcome [laughter] hello George it's an honor to talk to you I'm always nervous when I call in [laughter] no need your you're among friends what's on your mind\nThank you very much um I had an encounter way up in the woods and I've had a lot of strange encounters in my life\nAnd I have a very rational go analytical brain that overrides things and so it wasn't until years later I started putting all the facts together so the facts are I'm going I'm hiking into one of my favorite little fishing lakes\nThat basically off of an old logging road will win the forest service closes a logging road what they do in this logging road had been closed for a long time they bring in a major excavator and they dig a huge trench\nOn both ends of the logging road and pile up a big mountain\nOf the debris and boulders and things like that so it's impossible to drive a car or any vehicle down that road again you can kinda hike around it and even at times on your own two feet that can be very difficult because it's heavily wooded dishes in the coast range\nAnd it's basically rain forest a terrain [noise]\nSo I'm walking down the trail

I think you may have been Andrea Mitchell or somebody was saying well you know that's really not the\nNot the ah only\nWe had Thirteen Years of history to look at it the only way at something and Brett Kavanaugh's life we could look at to determine judicial temperament\nIf ... if I've only we had something other than responding to allegations of raping women to discern his judicial temperament if only the guy had said as a federal judge since two thousand four\nOh he has there ever been a single complaint about his judicial temperament and fourteen years on the bench not that I Know of\nAs it is there anybody who looks at a single opinion of Brett Kavanaugh says that was written in haste and anger\nThat right there that is a demonstration of the poor judicial temperament of I've ever seen one no but you know what a lot of people when falsely accused of rape and that was what he was claiming\nFalsely accused of attempting to rape someone or a tempting them less than a least bond with them a lot of people when falsely accused of something like that get a little angry they get a little animated and pissed off especially when their wife and intent and eight year old daughters are sitting behind him\nYeah defending the family on her\nThis is your one shot to go on national television and tell people I didn't do what they said\nAnd to enter fault somebody for being upset when they did it can you imagine if he had a cooling and calmly and with no emotion said\nOf course I didn't do that Mr Kavanaugh did you hold her down no Mr Kevin Oh did you uh did you try to tear closer now\nHas it it's it's just a dining experiences a cut above everything else it is high quality Italian food in a casual relaxed atmosphere to price point\nEveryone can afford to get by mid town pizza kitchen when you get the opportunity you will see positives there\nAre that would just wow you you'll see pizza that has WON Awards are at the local and state wide level you are going to see a a friendly talented staff is going to take care of you sixteen beers on tap the great one menu specials each and every day for lunch nine dollar lunch specials you can't go wrong ... kitchen as the our approaches the lunch hour approaches will give you a little bit more information\nAbout mid town pizza kitchen but right now just makes you lunch plans or dinner plans\nFor these elder played shopping center or the\nTown place a way to the high point town center the high point shopping center up in ...

but my memory that after the incident where he is he was a cost that allegedly by Kavanaugh in most marked it being in the room which she she wanted to say wait some time after\nThat incident\nAnd shaken centered mark your friend steel and went up to say Hi to him was that am I correct in that was just\n[noise] yeah I think that's right [noise] hot\nThen why would that not I I was disappointed if that's true that that wasn't a brought up body lady doing the questioning but there is not want 'em that I have met any woman who's been allegedly caused it in a factual stuff\nThat can hit are there are ... ... ...\nAfter the cage and it had happened and went up to him sometime later as say Hi because he was built but\nYeah I Wonder why they're not point bought out here here's why I think\nI'm ... and I know you you and I have been on opposite sides of cases in the civil arena also practice in the criminal arena some\nAnd and I've represented um and and I I mean if you Google mean you'll figure this out it's not like I'm I'm living a can of like oh no I don't know I'm represented some pretty bad dudes All right I've represented by bad guys have been some pretty awful things\nAnd when the accuser is on the stand\nUm there are two different schools of thought depends on depends on what kind of presentation they're making and whether they look believable in their in their direct examination of how you cross examined in my opinion [noise] I wouldn't attack somebody on little things like that\n\nTo address media er and television about trade deal with Canada and Mexico probably uh believe it or not we will have a bigger impact on your daily life in Brett Kavanaugh ever could possibly dream of having [noise]\nAh the reality is the Supreme Court just handle a shouldn't handle anything really that it does but it just handles\nOr some controversial issues on a [noise]\nAround the perimeter of life the U.S Mexico trade deal U.S Mexico Canada trade deal or will probably impact nearly every transaction you undertake for the next Twenty years and uh it's not only that it will I think revolutionize\nNeighborhoods and communities are I think it'll do a long way towards revitalizing inner cities\nAround the country a lot of the meltdowns\nThat happened in this country happened as a direct result of the global wealth compost complications in this country\nAnd those things hurt the poor in the lower middle class the most the middle class next the upper middle class to in the middle class the least because I mean the upper middle class no an upper class to leave because they can afford the little hits around the perimeter\nBut if someone's taking a hundred bucks a month out of your\nAbility to live and you only make nine hundred a month that's like eleven percent of what you make if you make ten grand a month and your upper class you you know a that's a very small percentage of it so there's this is this is massive this huge\nOr this is a massive victory for the very stable juniors it's a massive victory primarily for the United states of America in each and every person listening right now\nSomething is happening on television something has happened with Mexico and Canada\nThat that we'll go we'll probably have like I said a greater impact than almost anything else Donald Trump has done since he got there\nAre Lighthizer the trade representative from the United states\nShould should be on Mount Rushmore what he's been able to accomplish in under two years is nothing short of remarkable absolutely nothing short of remarkable I cannot give Donald Trump enough credit for what's going on in this economy\nIn this world with world peace with troops coming home from around the world with nuclear powers denuclearizing you know I I read a page today jak Campbell were North Korea and South Korea are jointly taking landmines out of the demilitarized zone\nIs if they're paving the way to open it up mhm I think so there's no other reason you would be taking landmines out of the DMZ no other reason\nUnless you were planning to open it up and they're doing that jointly or Donald Trump's impact on world peace is impact on the world's economy are in the American economy primarily\nUm cannot be unveil never get credit no but but but we'll know we know we'll know and even those who don't know they'll benefit from it and they are American so I'm Glad to benefit from it because we're all in this thing together maybe I'm beginning to wonder\nUh have a real quickly Mr saying man and not been by Mr saying man location please do please do uh I myself have been Mr Sam and several times but things over the years they stand up guy David justice is an absolute stand up human being over Mr saying man runs one of the finest businesses in Montgomery\nEighteen years Eighteen years you imagined being an industry leader for Eighteen years well he has been\nThere lots of places you can go buy mattress and he doesn't mind if you go shopping at the places\nJust make sure you shop him too and then you'll see why so many people choose Mr saying man then you'll see why Eighteen years he's been voted the best mattress store in the river region so get by one of his two locations\nAcross from the dollar general in milk Brooklyn highway fourteen just three miles off I sixty five up there and also right here in Montgomery just off of uh Atlanta highway on a highway actually just across from the Dairy Queen\nGet by Mr saying man and a they don't even mind if you're saying the jingle when you walk in the door they actually need to change their bill from the doorbell seeming to Mr sentiment\nThat would be nice when you you hear that when you're walking yeah it'd be really nice thanks for telling David how to run this business well you know\nBut it wouldn't be catchy what were you what was on your mind\nYou know I'm really tired of everybody's saying this woman is credible I don't think she's credible because every body that she said was there has said they weren't or it didn't happen so how the hell can she be credible\nWhat does she credible about oh there's something could have happened to her well bowl she says to Dick Durban hundred percent chance that it was Brett Kavanaugh here and nobody else will corroborate that so I don't think there's a damn thing credible about this woman except\nNow you know you wait you wait they're going to try to pay off the mark judge to say well I could have been wrong you know I had a sworn statement that it didn't happen but you know I drank a lot and then a lot of drugs and it might not be and then you'll know they got to him\nYeah if he changes his statement you know they've got to\nYou'll know that I got to him I'm just I'm with you ban to go from sexual assault too well he didn't tell the truth about how much he drank so what I don't tell how much I drank in college you know why because I don't know [laughter]\nIt was barrels in barrels of beer I I mean I Would drink twenty four beers a night at a party\nI mean seriously lacking and when I was in my fraternity and we would have banned parties yeah lord have mercy but I'm just I'm beside myself about\nThis would that be under a using Brett Kavanaugh's words too many beers yeah too many because he would say I would have beers and sometimes they have too many beers\nYeah you know I [noise]\n... I Hope I actually I Do hope\nOr if if anyone has got to him for a cell phone number please let them know I'm up for a federal judicial appointment anytime he wants to say the word I Will go through the process I Will sit at the table I Will answer the questions truthfully and honestly about everything I've ever done because that is a ...\nYour life and they can't fire you you kidding me and I miss not brought up on the why well\nShould be but that's because ... ... I Will absolutely one hundred percent go through that plus you get protection cops in in where we're not cute little dresses I'm tired of these commentators coddling this woman you have to both sides you have to they they have to because\nThey want I can understand why they do in the hearing but not these analysts that come on and say well she sounds very credible to me\nWell she sounded honestly I mean there were some inconsistencies in her statement but it did not look like a\nYou know she was just outline well you\nWhen you when the for them to say she's credible and nobody was there said it happened that is not credible in my boat period paragraph maybe I'm being a little tough owner but when you come on a national stage and he sent before Congress and a man's life hangs in the balance not life death life but\nHis career hangs in the balance and you make accusations when everybody else who was ... percent it didn't happen she is not credible I'm Sorry yeah our number two\nSeven to nine to two and twenty seven minutes after ten o'clock Randall\nLong law Hi Randall I'll I'll drive\nYour car and I I'm I'm Glad to be interested in and and then you're in you know now we're we're we're going to be\nBut it it was lower than the uh ... maybe ... or ... or it might not have to I mean I mean it was ... when they make\nYou make a good point let me stop let me stop you right there I mean you you just brought up an excellent point that I thought about what we were talking but I didn't actually uh\nUh get to the bottom of I was very concerned with the ... election in Mexico I wanted you got six months before the election that this guy was running and he probably would win and they wanted him to win and it was dangerous and he was a Hugo Chavez style communist\nRight down on our southern border and it would turn Mexico into a hell hole and then and then if we don't have a wall you'll have a hundred and fifty million people trying to walk in the United states at once I warned everybody about that\nThis trade deal I think goes a long way towards heading off a lot of what ... is wanting to accomplish\nAnd and keep in mind it was negotiated with nearly ... and ... administration's the incoming and outgoing Mexican administrations both negotiated this trade do because the incoming administration has to be okay with it so they don't just dumped at the moment they get there\nSo they they you know Lighthizer negotiated with both of them to make sure something everybody can live with which is why it was more important to get the Mexican part done first\n'cause we can only just force candidate to do whatever I mean I just I thought\nBy Andrew Rosenberg means he's up there\nWere no man I I hear about it and I have got a heck of a relief plan that he's going to like him on the man\nI just ran in my mind and it might not even you know you might not the run up to ... you know they may they may I ask if they do where he is the way the wall and then let them come here and even if you voted in the ... the way in four years when they when they go about\nGetting their curriculum and ain't gonna work\nWhat let me tell you this is a I don't think you'll have any ah problems about running for reelection in South Carolina I think he is just cemented the deal with the Republican Party that was a great speech he made\nWhere I thought whoa and uh but anyway yeah I have Great Hey I Want I don't want a yellow dog I won't be one of the good on that [laughter]\nOh okay you're late night show that you know really that ... that was a very shining moment for Lindsey Graham\nOh absolutely I mean there's probably his best moment yeah I didn't play that clip on our show I don't think it's good radio necessarily I mean it's good TV it's good video everybody should\nWander he's pointing it yeah but it ought to YouTube and sometimes it's\nThe red hat on his face in his finger and the and and the clear all that is what makes it so good uh it it's it's not the audio is just okay and and and what I mean by that is\nA link Lindsey Graham has a voice for print you know he's just not real forceful sounding but man he had a face for TV that day he sure did they really looked the part of the angry aggrieved senator fighting for truth justice in the American way I mean hell I half expected him to get up and put on a ...\nWell I mean he might fly around the room he's always been reaching across the aisle which is what they used to do in the old days and to the point where people said a he's a ... we can't count on him\nI think I think his eyes were opened during this hearing and he's going to be a damn good Republican after this I think I really think\nJohn McCain dying made him a better Republican I think I think and not not just because Donald Trump I mean John McCain had something on them or something or but I think John McCain was his best friend yeah\nAnd the military or Lindsey Graham serve you know a long longer career in the military just 'cause he wasn't captured and tortured by the enemy but [noise]\nUm and he was a lawyer and I think he looked up to John McCain ... how to I don't think he wanted to disappoint the old man and it gets so much respect for me didn't want to disappoint him they would do to your friends any in in John would probably had Lindsey we can't go along with this\nAnd and Lindsey would go oh yeah John sure but now that John McCain's dead he doesn't have that you know red tailed to horn red devil sitting on the shoulder hey hey Lindsey\nOur number two seven to nine to join David\nHey come on if all of the morning I I I I'm I'm kind of agree with you guys are there's just one thing that seems to me like should stand out because everyone is what I'm calling with a certain key factor yeah there was so much uncertainty in her testimony until\nShe said Oh absolutely want to understand I I Know exactly who are ...\nThat was that was every bit of certain yeah and the answer is that\nHow can I get home eight miles away and that's what I mean that's the real thing I Wonder if they've teen years old how do you get this is before the era of cell phones are not like she could go out and call somebody once she ... she doesn't see it on the bottom line is that how far it was yeah\nYeah she doesn't remember that show yeah I also think they are an intelligence to fish I mean that's like Bill road to downtown\nExactly that that long high that's ... you don't do it regularly\nYeah that's all I can do it regularly you ... if you if you run five miles a day just one run five miles still sucks [laughter]\nI don't you think if\nThey're if the me too movement of going to really try to be what they're trying to pay they need to be a little smarter with their uh with the ... don't you think what the past that and for for most of our age I'm\n... pound [laughter] me too [laughter] I'm going to college they press the star or the pound key exactly yeah hey that's how Larry's point I've not heard made yet about the human thank you so much you just made by ... certainly certainly\nOur number two seven to nine two to eight if you want to get into seven to nine to two able to take a quick one here Cooper\nHey you know I feel like most of us are you and then his audience consider ourselves the same one and we look at the far left of the Democratic party and we consider him being saying\nI'm just wondering are immigrants out there that also they may not want to come but they also realize that the left are left as down totally cars\nYeah it's particularly in the middle I I've kind of a kind of said this to for a last week that elections are pretty much always going to be in that fifty five forty five window I mean an absolute thrashing landslide election in a presidential election is fifty five forty but that was that was what the ah a\nRonald Reagan one fifty five forty five or just an absolute ... any one forty nine states by winning that big I mean so so that's sort of the outer limits of what you can possibly win at at the national level\nSo really you have a ten percent swings so it's it's really down to about ten percent of people about forty percent of people who claim they're independent the reality is only about ten percent actually switched their votes back and forth at the national level they only about ten percent\nAnd the question is what appeals to the ten percent is it the max\nApproach to governance where you harass intimidate\nUm make uncomfortable people who are just trying to do their jobs and are actually doing a damn good job economy booming stock market record highs every hour it seems like Mexico Canada coming to coming together with the United states to renegotiate NAFTA the north Korean Peninsula denuclearizing\nThe ice is completely obliterated in on the run\nWars being ended um a jobs flowing back in the United states trillions of dollars in the economy flowing back in the United states on a daily basis American industries that were once ... dead coming back to life killings being re fired in historic cities and and factories around the country\nOr is that the response that people doing those things deserve\nBecause what they're telling us is Donald Trump is Nazi\nAnd he wants to and slave people and do away with women's rights and he wants to take black people and and and then I guess burn them I don't know I mean what did not to do with people that are like they burn them I guess I guess that's the message they're sending and you know who's not buying a new more black Americans for one or buying it he's got thirty five percent approval rating among blacks\nThe highest Republican I ever remember it was George W. Bush at like eight\nUm and so they're obviously not by and I don't think that ten percent that moves back and forth in the middle on presidential elections I don't think they're going to buy it either\nAnd I think they're going to come out in the midterms and they're not gonna bite in the midterms either and Democrats don't vote in the midterms as much as Republicans do anyway we always have a slight advantage of one or two point advantage in turn out\nAnd I think that ten percent which is truly a ten percent the changes and I'm going to vote Republican this time I'm going to vote Democrat this time I think that ... percent is looking at what's going on around the world they're watching their four O. one K. swelling value the watching their incomes go up there watching job offers come through when's the last time people are more than one job offer\nMan there were there was a like a decade and a half under Bush and Obama where have you got a job offer you took the damn thing because there might not be another one coming for a year\nIt didn't matter what it was your field or not\nYou have people recruiting people who aren't even looking for jobs they're calling them out of the blue saying hey I I heard about you I Want you to come work for me\n\nThis is an economy this is a world we're looking at right now that's safer and more prosperous [noise]\n\nI'm telling you it's just a better world [noise]\nAnd I don't think a lot of people in that middle are going to have a hard time going back and forth and voting against\n[laughter] [noise] so I was trying to read them [laughter] closed captioning going back and let me just [noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\nYou\nWhether you're going to work or coming home early mornings for nine and after three she'll say only an insult got three boys want to see the\nNew Orleans\nTrying really wanting [noise]\nLet me award winner Eric how are you saying that the state of Missouri St Louis Missouri\nWell I got to the movies very entertaining in normally\nUp in the part of your statement yeah and Shannon brain question Tam on that and he verified and talked about how cruel and was to ask numerous questions\nThat that that dumped okay so to answer your question that is not a polygraph test that we could get ... around here one of the most accomplished polygraph test people in the country or he's local to ride around here [noise] uh and we can get him on and ask about it nobody is going to claim a polygraph test that as you exactly two questions his act [noise]\nAnd my understanding was she told somebody she was crying through and now that is true that just the whole damn thing or [noise] or again if you if you want [noise] I don't believe this is Sara Lee those things anyway I understand people do um and there's some people are doing better than others but I don't believe um [noise] just [noise]\nOffhand I mean you might be able to convince me particular person\nAs a credible one to administer it but I think it's answers credible I think I think he would be credible but just tell them a you passed a random lie detector test\nShow anything because of the questions are good minister and it's all up to the interpretation\n[noise]\nMaster control center and this is W.

you should have said in both sides are going to go to the new owners\nDuring the week it's not uncommon for a vote immediately if you're only going to just keep it up but the but you know it's it didn't say anything like that so and I don't know if I would've done it even if it said\nNo I I mean again I said there's a couple of weeks ago I think this is what needed to happen just to clear the air and I think they need to put to keep the pressure on the Democrats that they did not do this correctly\nAnd you're going to hear the your favorite senator from Hawaii a talking about that and what she does is oh she's doing just deflected ... that's all she was doing his ... and\nThe more I read and study this whole thing the more I realized that Bernstein has winking when I'm care as a

really does and and this is one of those things that the Republicans have got to get this thing done ... any of the ... reason to show that they can get it done but then just beat the heck out of the Democrats owned the process what they did in the Democrats are going to beat the heck kind of Kevin Oh talking about how bad to use them and they're not going to let go with this ...\nYou know I Know

free to say on the river regions most trusted voice huge dog bodies reborn wanna bam WABC me\nAnd you you're talking across purposes do they have to pay the bill to just stop what the investigation or what\nTo say no no we've seen this before we move into a fault\nNot the people that are trying to stop the the people that are asking putting investigation or Democrats were the people who clean and where it's going to actually happen all Republicans\nThey don't have it in other words a Republican said if you don't do and Appiah investigation and and you got one week and they're going to do it and if it's clean they said they were going to vote for it so that's I mean I think you have a boat as early as friday\nEntering the Democrats going you know boy anymore you know they're going to say who are these are these other accusations in allegations but that's you know there's nobody to\nDo well you're right I Hope they do move the vote if they do not\nBan are playing the Republican for the U.S as much I Will they will not stop the ball both of the fact is that tactic off and they are I mean 'cause this is purely a just war hatred ... ...\n... ... it's just handle this man is an out band\nHe's done been at it that I Would have\nThat on the New York oh what sixteen years\nNo not New York the D.C ... out by\nYou know one of the most influential circuit court judge has ever and by that I mean he is crafted opinions a decisive opinions in circuit court hearings and it has gone on to influence the Supreme Court's ruling setting the precedent right the very influential\nOn than that you know that that day it curious that one no but it it's pretty clear to the late tactic is taken by an apple\nIs now running or you know tell you you you are there are two different things they did immigrants who wanted to do I do I do I guess but the reason it actually got delayed because the Jeff Flake because he said listen to NPR report doing it in a week and then if everything's clear will the\nSame thing with Obamacare by McKay that's what I'm saying to you\nWho have money to the right now with McCain said he was going to vote for it\nYeah but the point that I'm making is if people in our audience that a conservative Republican\nThat all hope and that Trump visits the than an hour and ... and they set out that break in Arabic audience both ... over there but I Do want to make sure and they want to do this well at the end of the way they better be sure\nOkay so if he showed that wide and he was wrong that of the report is clean and you get a boat for mccaskey Collins imply that would show you're wrong right\nThat that would show all the wrong idea that now I'm ... I'm going to come up part of what it meant that democratic one what park at the end of this week and they're going to be like oh well maybe we need to try and that's what I'm saying you could draw your conclusion there\nOkay and the McConnell and there's another we should say when I Do anymore delaying the reporters clean then we're boating\nAnd taking off my bank on they don't know if they're going to vote on the\nSenate if they would clear the reporters claimed that they would the point\nNow where the at the end of the week you're right that that's why\nThe gentleman's agreement to ... we'll we'll see in the fullness of time\nAs you said so often that I mentioned all fair it's very frustrating because we picked up the committee vote a very dramatic where everybody sitting down and the committee hearing room Jeff Flake comes on and after some last minute backroom negotiations with the Democrats\nAnd he's saying if we just wait a week for the FBI do investigation for the time limit will only be a week longer\nThan I Will push this through committee will put take it to the fore and there's some confusion the Democrats are on in the committee room are saying wait or we voting on moving Kevin onto the floor we voting on this agreement and they say well it's not the McConnell\nAnd Senator Schumer whether or not we're actually going to have this week to lie but it sounds like that will happen sooner than he'd flakes vote Murkowski's Collins up\nSo the Democrats are saying well I agree with this one Portland still weak investigation\nAnd D.C those clips were I guess the one Democrat that will probably deserve credit is ... he did that interview with flake so\nYeah but he said here and they're both of them but there isn't a union and both of them is because of his temperament\nEnough and I've seen that argument I mean I'm I'm got problems if I was a sitting senator I Would have been asking Kevin all sorts of questions about mass surveillance in the Fourth Amendment\nThose sort of thing you use them an actual issues yes exactly I thought his temperament of how he was angry and sobbing at that last hearing was a very much characteristic of a man wrongfully accused falsely accused\nJust like the whole thing was a circus I like ... fickle theater but when it's just uses a delight tactic in order to demonize the other side well hopefully some truth comes out of it and hopefully something comes out of this last ditch investigation\nWell they're going to try new to get it out of this uh the senator from Hawaii and the way she's going to be talking about a matter of fact ah listening to her\nI Want to begin winding a with picking up on what you just heard from Senator Graham right there he is saying is that there's going to be an investigation the Democrats and how you handle Dr ...\nAgain as they're not focusing on the credibility or that they these credible reports\nAnd it's all about why did somebody wait so long and all of that the crux of the matter is that these are serious allegations and we have been calling for an FBI investigation for what ... months\nThese are not normal times on a normal times in a situation like this there will be an effort by FBI report we would have access to all the documents that we should get with regard to this nominee not just ten percent of the documents\nUnder normal times that we wouldn't be able to ask questions out of the relevant witnesses such as a mark judge and you know I don't know that the the average will be asking their own questions at a rather than hiring a prosecutor as though this is some kind of a criminal case to go after\nThe person who came for bravely to tell the truth of her experience\nShe did that oh you know so she criticizing Miller\nIn ... when do you do get to the bottom and I mean this is actually what they were trying to do the people who haven't wanted to get to the bottom of the Democrats have been if they really wanted this to ... bone out they would have ... they would have gotten her to\nSit down with them in a closed session with some people stay out and do the interview and then compare do there were plenty of job you do

[laughter] I had a very\nWay but I was discussing whether they you know sort of came to me\nUh but I think God is prepared to Brett Kavanaugh for this because who would have started keeping a calendar journal\nTwo years before this incident took place I'm a person does that if they're not being prepared for something later on down the road and I sort of believe that in fact a more of the ... but I think he's right where he's supposed to be and things are going to work out the way they're supposed to work out\nWell somebody should there's one group of people who do not want to see him in the in the Supreme Court and another group of people who really do and the question is what's the motivation of the people who really don't know exactly\nWhere those are the job I'm going to graduate listen to you when you go out and do it do to get as many can go into a quick break and more show will be back\n...\n... ... ...\n... he he sees he he he\n\nTo be a year to ... and able to use the three men and early\nMorning six to nine on news dark money three Boeing bought a damn W.

say get the dirt let's get the truth and that's how are ya I'm looking for what's the truth was the motivator well see I didn't have a political purpose as well is that\nRight yeah well absolutely when I said that there are I mean everything about or that that we should know I mean the truth like you said I don't know the absolute truth yeah who knows and both of you\nAbsolutely that's all I'm getting at is they'll you know I just kind of curious if there's any ramifications that answer once you get laid these allegations are as if it's going to be get\nWell here's a here's something that's interesting if she does a statement that say perjury statement or or a charge a possible perjury for making a post statement and everybody knows so is there\nSo that didn't happen then can they do something to her for that making about statement or is it the belief that it was it actually happened will get it off the hook I think the interesting part would be as long as your your\nStatement and their statements donated or can we make a suggestion to you know you go through an interview process for you to try to remember these things right and and let's see if we can get to the bottom of this cause that certainly would make everybody feel better about it\nAbsolutely I mean I Believe the right now that we were not getting that we're not getting the whole picture we just getting ... media wants to\nWell what would you have a democratic operatives\nWho didn't want the truth to come out they wanted the accusation come out and they wanted the truth they would have gone in and then it was a ... interview with her with some people that are trained in in doing that which lady Mitchell was and and find out what happened here\nAnd because her story does not line up with everybody else's story that could have been done six weeks ago seven weeks ago but now the Democrats didn't want to find out the truth would they want us to do is have the accusation\nYeah absolutely and that right there with everything else on hold until we go through all this\nYeah they're they're just trying to ... it's just that it's not any more complicated than that\nRock or I rarely that's the ultimate

are\nUsed to make\nA list of is just go to um ... and ... and he's going to lose any age here between saying something to the Congress that is not being correct and this is one area I'm concerned about and that is the drinking and being drunk\nBack to the previous and she gave it to the FBI came back and says well yeah so and so this question we were not able to draw conclusions based on the answer we got from set a witness to come back to the Senate\nWhat did they do with that information if it really just things that go past friday does Mitch McConnell's say hey listen you agreed to seven days and\nThey will go past friday is Mitch McConnell does not have fifty one boats\nAnd that will be determined by either the four who insisted on this FBI investigation Senator Flake Senator Murkowski Centre College and I think senator a mansion or if the if judge Kaplan I Begin to lose other support so I said it's perilous for him\nHe has locked in his version of events it's not a crime to be drunk when you're a kid it's not a crime to pass out when you're a kid\nBut it is highly perilous for a federal judge to state that under oath when there's evidence to contradict that if there is to have a great way\nUncovered Murkowski and Collins has mentioned in the high camp and many others would you agree with that yes and this whole FBI investigation could very well give\nMansion and odd camp a cover to vote yes which will help them and they're a political races and assure the confirmation of judge calving judges another week where we do not know so\nHang on production will be talking about it a week from today agreed yes\nThey will be done but there's a week from today ownership yes it um and it may be talking about the fact that he got out from under it but\nAt the new cheaper vote on friday\nAnd there is a a a letter of full statement given by ... coins as there were a student at Yale is the same times Kavanaugh saying he is not telling the truth about his drinking habits and\nKnow that needs to be a statement given directly to the FBI then that gives it a little more force instead of two newspaper but we will see\nAnd he is a professor of I'm not mistaken a Chapel Hill or an cease to think so yeah and how it's going to be concerned about professors or the in the liberal domain is I Would say\nI'm\nSo no one is um this kind of wander over to um Jonathan Turley who's who's been another interesting spin on this ... and that we owe Tuesday that we're talking about so much\nPat vi exclusively does not in this or any by case reached a conclusion period so when people waving FBI report before you understand they do not they do not\nThey do not reach conclusions\nHe's right and that was then Senator Joe Biden back in Nineteen Ninety One dismissing the effectiveness of an FBI investigation during the Clarence Thomas hearings so what does this tell us about the current FBI probing and judge Brett Kavanaugh So Jonathan how would you grade that Joe Biden on the law right there [laughter]\nWell he's clearly correct you know the FBI produces these reports\nCalled three oh Tuesday tail well witnesses said to them or they may also take some ... a physical examination of houses suspected of being a the one described by doctor for\nA but it's largely descriptive it's largely are just as sort of documenting the accounts in what is available for other people to reach conclusions\nThere's going to the phones to Bill Bill welcome aboard that emotion\nAnd he ...\nAnd I called you the other day and do John thought this was excuse me kind of an extreme where they're ending everything on the uh investigation\nYou know it\n... it on my Facebook page and the other day it if they're gonna ... if if the Congress is going to require\nThis investigation than any time there is anything that has risen up\nAbout Congress House representatives any elected officials as well was nominated officials should they investigated or goes as it seems to me here just a couple of years ago we had senators or [noise]\nThanks I appreciate you David you have to stay there was this coming forward the coup weather's coming for you [noise] okay So Jonathan Turley is going to keep on going is going to be was saying is this going to be good for Kavanaugh having the the investigation\nPoint you make of the suggestion by some Democrats even if judge Kavanaugh is seated on the Supreme Court they're going to have another investigation or if the Senate doesn't do a thorough enough ...\nWind a column coming out this morning on the hill talking about how exceedingly dangerous ... suggestion is\nYou know the framers created a system to insulate justices from political pressures that's why they made impeachment so difficult to maintain once you've confirmed someone\nI then we generally impeachment in investigations are about conduct in office as a justice you know there have been other justices lane Kagan who was accused of\nNot being completely truthful in her testimony whether you accept that or not and there's arguments on both sides no one suggested to renewed investigation for impeachment\nThey the danger here is that\nIs that members of Congress can always wants power flips try to reshape the court do or redo\nAnd do you really want that type of system when the FBI investigation while a lot of people on Capitol Hill didn't want it it's probably ultimately good for Mr cabinet ... and I\nI think it is I think that this is much better for him to be confirmed after giving a little time for investigation to reduce that cloud otherwise he'll never regain any part of his reputation they'll all be Matt Damon and not him\n[laughter] the Matt Damon ... to the uh as soon as I was scared to de de which I thought it was a pretty big cheap shot a most oh consider Matt Damon in the past and his went in with a may too and things like\nAnd now this move into major Garrett talking about Kevin\nFBI has now investigating the sexual misconduct claims against judge Brett Kavanaugh that have stalled his Supreme Court nomination undivided American voters in at CBS News poll out this morning thirty five percent of people say the Senate should confirm Kavanaugh\nThirty seven percent wants senators to vote against them in twenty eight percent believe it's too soon to say\nThat he outside counsel higher question ... foreign ... Republicans on the Judiciary Committee that a ... difficult to prove that quote this case even weaker than lap major Garrett in fact the White House the white\nHouse did not want a new FBI investigation to seventh if you're keeping track into Brett Kavanaugh butter greed because it was the only way to keep Kavanaugh's embattled nomination alive now this weekend and new clash arose over Kavanaugh sworn testimony last week not about sexual assault what about his drinking habits\nThat ... percent of the evidence hey look\nJudiciary Committee democratic ... warned the White House has tried to protect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by ordering a narrow investigation\nThey cannot say oh hey only intervene in the people in their neighborhood on one side of the street\nThe FBI will not pursue allegations from Julie sweat that Kevin was present at parties in the early eighties where women were given excessive amounts of alcohol and sexually assaulted\nNew transcript show in an interview with the Judiciary Committee last week Kevin are called sweat next allegations total BS she's lying Kavanaugh said sweat next thing is a joke\nThat is a force\nAnd he said they're pretty a powerfully so much is going to keep doing it in here talking about the governor investigation and Canada here do did you come up with a conclusion and there's\nA new front in the Kavanaugh saga\nHow truthful he was about his drinking habits in high school and college city the FBI may investigate that\nI did not treat beer to the point of watching out or you know college classmate of Kavanaugh's Charles Chad ... said Kevin I'll Try to deceive the Senate by downplaying his drinking habits flooding and says on multiple occasions you saw Kevin are staggering from alcohol consumption\nWhen Brett got drunk he was often belligerent and aggressive letting added he would take my information to the FBI\nThey have free rein to do whatever they have to do whatever it is they do\nOn Sunday lawyers

be great to have your expertise\nAt hand um there was a story I mentioned\nEarlier that I wanted to get your take on and says I stupidly closed that page of my screen but it's something that ...\nAnd he's been an interesting study because he's always been staunchly liberal but liberals been read to find\nA to an unbelievable extent it means something totally different to me now than it did a few years ago uh we're almost felt like I can coexist or we could go exist because we were\nYou know\nThat far apart but ... it's\nAll the rules are called off\nAs Alan Dershowitz all the rules are called off with a white man is accused by the left of sexual offenses that's his take on this year measure the liberal Democrat president at a part of the first Muslim American Supreme court and somebody said oh yeah I remember he was a terrorist when he was Seventeen\nThe ACLU it'd be all over this case though you can't presumed guilt of terrorism and on and on and on and on the ... in your words\nWhen this wasn't a trial but\nWhat happened in the presumption of innocence\nWhile they're treating it like a trial which is a weird thing in a weird bifurcated five minutes of cross examination direct examination they're they're treating it like at trial unfortunately here I can tell you from the lemonade very limited amount of criminal knowledge that I have\nUm I I don't think this case would have passed the grand jury I don't think it would have even been presented to a grand jury I don't think they have any real evidence that the he said she said which are the hardest cases to try it's been very much like in a domestic violence case that we try\nWhere you know the wife says one thing the husband says something else there's no pictures there's ... there's no marks there's no nothing very difficult to prove a case like\nThat have you noticed I don't know if you've uh\n'cause I Know you're busy and there's so much going on now I Can't keep up a little um and I spend a good two hours browsing news sites before coming in the afternoon that's usually where my head's ready to explode at three on days like the last week or so\nThe co chair of the Democratic National Committee Keith Ellison has been accused of spousal abuse but I did not hear that his girlfriend see\nBecause the media has made an effort to that make you aware of that and she's got photos and all kinds of evidence and yet I don't hear any demands for an investigation I hear the Democrats and we're going to uh ask him to step aside but we look into this and if there's nothing there then you can ...\nAnd I think they're I think there is a double standard I think it would be really tough to argue that that there is not um you know it's kind of the same way with with our cases you know\nMen and women are are treated differently and in this case and and recently if you're a conservative\nTreated odds are much more gently in cases like this and well no I mean this isn't a criminal trial and and you are not\n... it's different and the fact that you are not\nConstitutionally entitled you know in this case really anything I mean and judge Kavanaugh is is not really entitled to any the anything but there are just ... you know\nA notion of of fair play and and just the fact that they shouldn't have to prove you're innocent you can't prove a negative mhm forty ... you know forty years later\nWell not something I feel like it would be one thing for me if they had like a and I use the term my clients he's all the time like a smoking gun you know like if all of a sudden they rolled like you know on video and on a on a VHS player of like this party and he's there and all that but we don't have anything like that\nHave any evidence and think about this uncorroborated totally without a shred of evidence or a witness who will support her story where this has taken Brett Kavanaugh Keith Ellison\nFrom a ... ... the abuse allegations that gives Keith Ellison explain I'm from NBC Kids I was abused claim unsubstantiated attorney concludes of from Huffington Post representative Keith Ellison abuse claims unsubstantiated\nOf from time investigations ions geez I was abused claim unsubstantiated\nThey got this guy's bought covered from one end to the other mhm but they're ready to fry Brett Kavanaugh over\nA\nStory told by a child like middle aged woman well I\nYou know I think it's a kind of a double edged sword to compare one or the other because I don't feel like you know\nThat Keith Ellison actions have any bearing whatsoever on Brett Kavanaugh faction don't feel like even if he did beat it I was just illustrate it meant you write that it makes Brett Kavanaugh's any better or if Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her you know that it makes heat Allison's any better but I I think you're right and that\nI think that that you know Democrats and Republicans these days are treated differently\nThere's no doubt about it I mean the whole atmosphere of Washington has just so changed and doesn't mean that it was never intended to me\nMakes me wonder these people that advocate and are literally they're big concern was face their big concern is turning the Supreme Court into a legislative branch that when they're\nCrazy unconstitutional legislation gets passed challenge and makes it to the Supreme Court they count on an Alina Kagan's so to me or to court to go about looks All right you know and just\nShoot a sign off on it but every careful when you're playing with the court\nWell oh it's eight people know so\nThere be a lot of foreign for ties there could be\nYes are there any chases I remember when when they were announced ready to announce the Obamacare ruling that was like coming down to Christmas in a way because everybody wanted to weigh but as dramatic moment\nAnd there were days and days of so called experts say yeah they're going to\nCheck it out it's just not doesn't pass blah blah blah\nAnd sure enough all never forget we were out in the morning when the ruling can probably pick up a lot of cases encouraged me around but the problem because as I Know\nWell and and yes and no um but\nBecause they don't take up cases that everyone agrees for 'em but I but I think that\nYou're you're generally correct in that\nI think they know better [laughter] and just just right now I I think that they know better but what's unfortunate is due to the Supreme Court is not supposed to be political ... nomination nominations make it seem that way well and and you know again that\nLends to it and on appearance to it but the Supreme Court is does it designed to be a political\nNews of these shows are burned Coleman who I think it was a brilliant guy a\nSaid there's several weeks ago says this is\nNot the way it's supposed to be a Supreme Court nominee should not inspire this level it's supposed to be you know is this person qualified to rule unconstitutional issues period\nSaving more

he squeezed by even an ally of the fact that he just you know the white lies told is that\nGiven a given the or the the mood of things and and I've seen some polling today Claire McCaskill is now behind him Missouri\nEighty percent of West Virginia once Joe Manchin to vote for Kavanaugh he's a Democrat so unless he wants to blow up his seat in the Senate he got to do with the voters want

anything\nAnd I don't brag on this stuff it's part of my story sometimes you can help somebody else and one of the things I Try to communicate is giving up\nAlcohol and\nCertain types of drugs\nAnd I was afraid to do it why because I didn't know how to enjoy a party or how to go ... or or do anything\nWithout being\nChemically altering but guess what it's telling somebody this today\nWell we're

and you're tempted you really nuts\nThe different thing you know and I don't feel like I have a problem not ringing my hands it's more like why does give it a try just for a month and you know yeah and then knowing is getting something if you don't make it you're not putting your life marriage a career at risk because that's what I Would be doing you know I've thought about it this way today\nFor me and it took a lot of work and a lotta ask kicks and consequences but for me it was a matter of connecting to little dots\nThe first thought is the first drink the second thought and

to alcohol but\nYou know what I've noticed I'm is over the years 'cause now I can safely go into a bar and not have to worry about temptation but\nWhen you're married to a beautiful woman almost raising you go in a bar I think it'd\nBe that would never have happened if I hadn't if I can drink like when I tried to make is\nUm [noise] you know I lost the part I was trying to make hanging on

D. P. Y. daily ... diamond Dallas Page baby yeah you can do a brother and\nI like it because it isn't like all the fancy words isn't you're not sitting there breathing into opposed for like ten brass like meditation knows my point is to get your heart rate up get those muscles flexing like burn build muscle\nBuddy uses some yoga poses and principals in order to increase flexibility\nAt strengthened yourself in different ways because of some of the folks don't know yoga can be incredibly difficult it can be incredibly difficult it can also be very easy and relaxing day to be or not as relaxing right so I was showing off to fund size Jane\nLike how much I've learned from just data peas version of and kind of comparing notes to traditional yoga like and I got into it I did the whole stand up on one leg all the other foot up\nAnd one of those people good or bad helpful or controlling or in the system they use it to further their ins and that's all I have on public choice theory that there's the same sort of weird incentives\nThat you might get in and say I'm working environment but in this case it's not the price system guiding things about the almighty dollar it's now power\nSometimes mix with the almighty dollar\nYeah you see it with a CPAs like in the NFL\nI mean it's incredibly slanted towards the guys\nThe professional football players that created the CPA at the time you know they're not going to look towards the future because they've only got what five maybe ten years and only Fifteen if you're lucky quarterback so you get everything you can now but then guys that come up and didn't get to negotiate on that CPA at all these guys that are get drafted say this year\n... they're screwed right\nAnd it's a perverse incentives we had to look beyond just what's on the face of the systems and so this is what does this mean if their assets and they're always looking out for themselves whether they're well intentioned or they're just controlling from the get go means that politicians will take money from people most of us would and shake hands with\nMeans that they will tell us they do not believe in spying on the American people or the government operate in secrecy while they continue to spy on the American people locking up around anyone who questions the secrecy which\nThat's now coming to fruition and all sorts of different ways and that means that they will tell us they want to help care for the helpless while they make it illegal for charities stuffy starving which is true story\nSomebody got in trouble in Florence for the or in North Carolina for helping with the hurricane Florence with the the animals animals no charges were eventually dropped the gods but they were going to lock up a woman for operating a\nVeterinarian facility without a license for helping animals in the storm\nYeah that brings up an interesting question\nIs law\nAs a zero tolerance\nIt shouldn't be right so\nMost of the gay movies are made prudence prudence yes I think that's all you still have a system where the jury\nEight or whether it's the drug war or just larger topics this came up here in Alabama and a lot of district attorneys don't like it\nOf mandatory minimum mandatory sentencing because it didn't why do you even have a judge what do you even have a da Vinci going to be okay you did this crime it's automatically this\nOh maybe it should be more because there's other circumstances this person's life and keep ... up bending over and over again right maybe it should be less you've really we're in a bad situation and you just need a little bit of helping hand to get out of it are a little bit of a corrective\nUm I don't I don't like the zero tolerance off with their heads approach it certainly doesn't work in schools and my opinion but you know I'm not an administrator loan appropriated play and to try not to the ... playhouse into this right after Trump was elected but the blame on earth or Miller the crucible\nThere's one line where at the end after several people have been known for being which is where the judge is kind of approach saying yeah the girls who told you they're all which is they were making all that crap off it's like well justice demands that we punish everybody equally\nDespite these new facts and that's the zero tolerance approaches like to keep the appearance of the law in must always be divvied out in the same way when that's\nCharity by any other day you know what I mean really is yeah so\nScared ... makes it clear because I've done this and people are like I'm being cynical Joe you're always so negative blah blah blah blah blah on politics she says but her law is in one of despair\nForm of well it's all about liberty\nSo to speak\nOnce you realize the politics works its way that all politicians are in fact assets\nYou were free\nFree from an aide to hope for and look for and blindly follow one particular political savior or party\nYou are free from having to make excuses when you are inevitably disappointed in betrayed you are free from the need to rearrange your mental for furniture to accommodate the brain splitting ... supporting a politician wins the Nobel Peace prize while implementing drone warfare well that's a little bit of a shot at Burr Oak Obama\nOn civilians abroad and at home or a politician who praises the free market while bailing out banking and corporate cronies because they're too big to fail that's a little bit of a shot at George W. Bush\nAnd good it's a target rich environment\nAt the drone warfare that yeah\nI liked that that was good\nAnd then once you're free Sarah scorer ID realize the politics isn't the solution to the things you see that are broken because they can't be the solution because politicians are assets\nThey're wasting your time and your money in your energy they aren't allying you with people you hate them with causes you despise them with the actions you would never condoned don't wait around for them to save you are the things you think are important I don't think you've found the politician to convince the world politicians are assets you don't have to be\nYeah unfortunately my than them deserve Squires first law here is that the other a lot of people who will for these people who are assets as well\nI'm not talking about the new ones person it really keeps themselves informed of the deeply principle person who's you know they know they're carrying my cause it's there are a lot of ignorant people who just go oh it's time to vote okay\nYeah or the the people that watch the cabinet offering and and and threatened his life or forwards life exactly yeah when I hear about that stuff like my God yeah like way\nAnd I want to say we're we live in a society people when they get this bad but if you go\nYeah it's just a lot easier nowadays for it to get out in the open\nIs documented in real time right yeah and yeah I think there is that people are a little more susceptible to getting upset because it's always documented or real times like always in your face some people get all up in arms but if you realize this is just as Henry that surrounds me\nThey don't have to be part of it\nI can kind of\nYeah like it's something that's good it's a built in to the system and so you realized okay don't have to put up with the scrap the whole time\nSo yeah\nI liked that long it's ... it's a good long it's a good law so there'll be an FBI investigation\nThat's got to end on Thursday night on Thursday or friday and initially said here your witnesses to interview and today they said well I mean if you fall when he leaves his fault elites like interview whoever you want yeah that's because the Democrats were like wait a minute ride\nWell and I watched that committee vote after the hearings the next day or just like comes out for the back room and all the other senators already sitting down says his after he was a say accosted yeah ... ... I think it was also conversations with the Democratic Senator Chris Coons\nAnd a few others and he said you know I'm going to vote to advance cabin audit committee if we have a investigation I'm not a yes vote in the full how are full chamber we did a weeklong investigation limited scope to these allegations in front of us\nDon't want this to be an opportunity for more people to go open an investigation more allegations morally is morally you don't you don't want a special counsel right [noise] which\nWithout limits can be a bit of a problem because almost everybody commits selling each day\nNot to mention the assets who are running for power in this country yeah so you know\nThat's that being said we'll see where the investigation goes more frustrated me though is that there were Democrats in that chamber saying oh I I I'm not agreeing with advancing Kevin agreed yeah let's have this week long FBI investigation thank you for your bipartisanship Center for like two days later like\nI don't know if this is going to be a legitimate investigation it's like oh come on man yeah\nIt's your fault for not realizing that wasn't going to be legitimate from the start\nOf the same thing I ... well it's ... it's it's a very similar thing that happened when Ohio State said that they were going to have an independent investigation into urban Meyer dry and in order to make it independent they were going to bring people in from the outside so they had three people from the board of trustees one person who used to\nBe a judge 'em for the district of Ohio and in\nLike two ex senators right and when that and then when they came out and they were like uh\nYeah he lied\nBut we don't think it was on purpose it was like okay this was a sham from this dark you're just trying to cover your cash cow and you don't want to pay out\nBecause you have to fire urban Meyer for being right\nBeing and not decent human being\nI mean this is the common thread\nAnd I'm pulling up something I brought it up last week but this got me going\nGot me thinking that this doesn't apply to just politics and it's kind of a combination of different quotes that I've made into my

Avi cliche that\nI mean you've got to understand the rules beautiful to look at but it's got the want don't at all you know watch out for the doors you either go\nBut you have a way of looking at both aspects of it from a distance that that brings everything to light and and that is that is a great point you don't have is not very many people that have that kind of point if you step back and look

this and I'm sort of taken a to a different place to in the sense of a lot of people will do a talk show of like I'm right here is the truth it's like no\nI'm just Joey here's my perspective and I hope a lot of it's true or else what the hell am I doing with my life but especially on politics I've watched it enough to go my God what a\nShow ... a bunch of assets and I'm not just saying that as oh they're full of crap now I've even gotten away with like my fellow libertarians who I'd do I'd love to hear them constantly I I wrote one guy who does another show mats\nAnd he posted something saying I used to be a libertarian but I just don't care he's like I Can't stand these people and I actually wrote him\nAnd said well I'm Still a libertarian\nBut I don't care nearly as much as I used to I really don't like it's not the first thing I bring up and discussion anymore right really not it's not how I pray imminently identify myself it's like I'm a libertarian I care about politics now I'm really into like collecting vinyl records and I'm really into\nLike listening to wrestling pod cast in watching wrestling I don't know I'm trying to expand my horizons beyond just oh wait we've got to be done with the cause I think as soon as you get caught up in any sort of cause and that way especially one for a political power it's going to be an unhappy ending\nYeah even after a moment of glory like what happens next\nWas especially if you go in not cynically because right you will find that the things that you wish for true just simply aren't like JD mentioned integrity ...\nIntegrity in politics based on my understanding and observations as seeing everything that goes on in Washington heck even locally\nIntegrity as as a zero sum game\nIntegrity will get you know where it might get you a couple of votes temporarily but it takes is a smear campaign to get those votes back to someone else\nRight it is very easily easy to smear principled person it's weird how that works integrity\nGets you someone saying something nice at your funeral\nWell I mean that's I hate to say it I Wish it were a really are much more popular thing in Washington but I haven't seen it for a long time\nRight but not in politics and this is where I have moved where my my brand if I have to bring a politics\nIf I have to bring up being a libertarian it's it's about people over the political causes you know I Know some people will say my college is all about people and you can you OK okay what do you mean by that is like get to know your neighbors\nMake sure you're being a good friend a good family member but your own individual life back in order and there'll be amazing ripple effects\nFor yourself and others you might not save the whole world there might still be you know a catastrophe or natural disaster somewhere else or maybe the planet gets hit by a meteor at by the way there's apparently an asteroid across very close to earth on Halloween Night\nShaped like a skull yeah I don't know how it's going to be\nEarlier than our way was Halloween sometime last year that had happened they remember some time last year ... Halloween happens on October thirtieth\n[laughter] no I get that way too [laughter] you know and there are some days man where I come in here and I'm like damn I've just to six hours which I can\nYeah and the ... chamber up right in the seat and star hosting but you know such is\nLife right now selling V. yeah no big deal I I agree I agree with you just add on to my point about integrity in Washington I might not see it that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist fair enough and furthermore if I can have it in my own life", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Coosada", "day": "01"}
