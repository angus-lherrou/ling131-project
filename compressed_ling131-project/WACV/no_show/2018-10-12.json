look in the mirror and you looked like a mutt 'cause he ate too much and you've got a full good and you better savannah we're both Cuba then never mind [laughter]\nUh I've been I've been trying to eat\nBetter have lost a little white you know I lost literally about thirty pounds that's impressive and uh I've been trying to eat better not easy you know sweet stuff\nGod love bread I don't know oh you're in Miami what are we talking about hard to stay away from red somebody was talking about it the other day I think it was Emily on the morning show right here on this this radio station ... talking about a\nQuincy's yeast rolls ooh\nNow I could just you know no I don't think I won't but are they still around I don't I don't think we have one here that no such thing thanks so the closest thing is the golden corral over here oh okay\nAnd uh but they they just don't have the Big East girls what they did they don't\nUh I'm actually got one I went and bought one of the little it's a little plus dollars is about six inches tall as the big ... those were so good you could you could go in and buy a dozen of them and they give you the butter and stuff going on his mind could make a meal out of that oh yeah\nYou know a Texas wrote has has some good road do they yeah they put it let her out there with me how to go over there and where is it where is it in a case not on the other one that is that the one where the gave me the peanuts yeah but oh yeah you always wanted to take my mama bear the peanut fell on a limb and\nThey don't let you tell the peanuts and approach much you know I heard that I can I did stop there you go to the Santa Fe the Santa Fe dam and Troy ... really yeah\nI understand that the reason they stopped is because they were paying somebody like you know minimum wage to to clean up all the pain that I've heard that also heard it was because people were slipping down but I don't know it could who knows but if you slip down there were to give you separate for free you know maybe that was it they give them more to many suffers with so\nYou know you ... flying objects and um [noise] when we know that something could be flying high\nAnd we identified you know like the market\nWe also know that something could be flying low\nOr you know that old saying and say did you fly there no but I flew low and I got there you know what the talk oh yeah ... but a little liberal with the speed limit right but what you don't you might if you're flying low we got away you can fly and you can fly low and middle would fly low the rich mhm\nAnd then you don't have to ride on that high us\nYou know you don't want to have to be in the crash crash scene is ugly scene especially if it's a\nWhen they took the queen ... in a you've been ah you know check made it maybe the check [laughter] tech may when the tech yeah and that's the end of your day it's all over that ... going to be your fate your fate is a and then you come in but it'd be too late mid to late\nSo what you want to do is if we do you're gonna fly\nAnymore fly on the low side get down low where if if something crashes you can just reach out with your foot in this kind of like grab a hold of the ground aha you'll be silent kind of step out right so you don't get mashed about am still saying we're going to fly\nWe're gonna fly like we're flying up in this guy we're going to get to where we need to go but we're going to be flying low so we'll take away all of that risk that could\nCome from flying out of this come from flying on this [laughter] you know [laughter] you ever see anybody throw it is you know fly like a flying saucer ... throw that day is getting flies through the air like a flying saucer like a UFO and then they break somebody hey you broke my ... you may I ask you that\nYou don't want that you want to be flying low now flying low risk but you still get there in a hurry ... you still get to retirement you still get their you still you're taking care of as sort of lack\nOf you know back in the olden days when they were used to drive those cars around in a you know\nThey were made out of big metal oh yeah ... what was the Jay Leno said that uh them the motor cars you have an accident they just get in and hose off the dash and sell it again right\nYou know in the in the days in today's market is you don't know what's going to have\nWhen you get hit you might turn into like a bug on when she who might explode him right\nSo you don't want to be in that modern mowed the modern mode of what everyone else is trying to do trying to keep up with the Joneses trying to do this trying to do that trying to ride around in the in the brand new the brand new equipment to the Cadillac I don't know they don't have Cadillac so much you to know\nWhether they ride and then now ah ah let's see if people you know well the the BMW Leah you got ... ... oh yeah [laughter]\nYou know you've heard of those yeah I didn't get the real expensive BMW i just got the dependable you remember the when the Cadillac was like you know forty feet long and then you've got big old by the Cadillac ... now there's so much smaller oh I Know and uh [noise] excuse me my mother in law always drove\nA link and she just wanted to being something big catch something here but they're much smaller now right uh I used to watch or what was it a Hawaii Five O I lived there and I'm ... drove around that big old Lincoln\nAnd uh and it was it was huge so like a boat coming down and you know a while if I have always been on again but they're they're coming back to where the mother Hawaii and show a magnum and then I had them yeah I haven't\nSeen hadn't seen that when they have heard several people around the world you know well you know magnum eighty years old now they had the other guy to do it yeah but ah they have a ... he don't have a much better but I don't think so and\nA Higgins is a woman Higgins as a woman you have like that and let's see what else they know Ferrari and areas oh yeah he got in a Ferrari to oh not our our I was watching it and when everybody was driving got totalled\n... and he came in there and he got into a Ferrari and I think he really liked it or they got to redo the Ferrari ha ha but uh I I like the original when I was I don't\nWant to give this other one chance but I've had several people say they didn't care for that I've been to\nPractically all the Hawaiian Islands on into the the big island\nFirst one I went to was co why ... with a K that's the old style and it's for a million years old ... yeah the thing to realize when you get to know why\nIs that is nothing but a chicken coop Syria yeah\nChickens everywhere may I say for saw these chickens doing out here they said well a long time ago there was a ship that broke down that route here I guess it sunk or something and they use chickens they all came to show and we just leave him alone they just kind of like run around you go\nYou go in like a store like a main store you know there's a chicken out there and we're looking at you going in the I mean like [laughter]\nLike what's the chicken in here is walking in the store you go\nYou go up into the end of the land of close to the top of the island's yeah and there's chickens or perish just walking around like they own the plane back into the store and a chicken trying to get you to buy some beer I mean they didn't check in terms of afraid of people uh-huh these chicken is things that they rule the ... offers\nA chickens and red dirt say shirts if you don't know what a red dirt T shirt is\nYou go to Hawaii a Hawaii is where they came up they had a a storm there\nAnd all these church family in the mud and they they somebody is what we're going to do with we're going to sell them\nAnd we're going to ... 'cause they all died out you know like kind of a orange you look in a mud yeah and now they sell them everybody in the mid west stone over in California because I go to court or to Hawaii ... yeah they buy these things but in Alabama you don't ever hear of I got out I read the T shirt red T shirt hat\nMm and nobody knows and they ask you about it and you have to tell yeah you have to wear this is the chicken coop play you know so much has been going on and you speak about we talk about conspiracy because the news feeds that because you'll hear something and you hear it then you hear and there's something else comes along and that disappears yeah\nBut uh the last I heard from Hawaii about a volcano was still a rough day right now is it still doing that or did Iran will but I tell you what is ...\nIs a that Kevin all thing that that Hawaii and senator is trying to uh ... some stuff and uh uh what was that she said that he was a he was entitled he felt like he was entitled yeah\nYeah they are now here's the thing I failed lack yeah\nEvery one is worked real hot out there and saved up all their do isn't titled for a good retirement don't you know I think that and we saw any if you're going to get set up\nLack Kavanaugh said it and all of a sudden you back to retire and then all of a sudden that market take us away is\nThat would divert all over all the various workers away from what they should be doing to trying to take care of the president's state so\nHe'll get their president but I also want to see just whatever Donald Trump does\nHe's gonna be attacked\nThese people don't like him they wake up in the morning they say I Know he's done something terrible what is it and that's kind of their approached everything right now and it makes them frankly a little bit nutty\nWell and I think that uh again the the theory and the frenzy\nAh has gotten to a point that when I was talking to folks and yesterday who were in Washington\nAnd in Nineteen sixty eight riots after Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy or both assassinated and they were saying that they hadn't seen anything is is angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate\nYeah I think I think basically you had strong ordinary intensity up through Watergate you had a nobody had a million people\nSurrounding the Pentagon at one point or you had soldiers who found that they couldn't go through airports are being harassed a window is a very bitter very divisive time [noise] uh but I think after that\nUh we became sort of more normal for a while\nAnd uh now we're drifting back a because this is a genuine a cultural civil war I mean you know [noise] what Hillary Clinton said it wasn't and actors that shot some people because she's basically right or when we're point or somebody like a justice cabin all\nIt's because we want to return to a constitutionally based court system that uses the American system is this model not some European or South African or other kind of system and as a result\nIf your a left wing a Democrat we we we're at the end of your world you know they had hope desperately to change America and now\nThe American people are responding and saying no we don't want to say we liked being Americans and I think that has become just an enormously bitter blow for the\nPeople who who thought up until election night two thousand sixteen they were ... Hillary Clinton was going to when they go at the two justices you got\nAnd Hillary bin ... oh my God you know they'd be so far to the left and so so unwilling to look at the American constitution\nVery dramatic difference compared to where we are now\nOr I Want to play for you ah Larry Sabato who of course famously bombed and his protections for twenty sixteen but nevertheless has this production for the midterms if there has ever\nAbnormal presidency where he had it and the Trump is violated sold many of the rules of politics in so many of the norms of politics a red wave ain't gonna happen\nIt's just a question of how big the blue wave is I think it'd be a suit on me it could be a middle sized way they can be a small wave is going to be a blue wave\nOr what is the reaction thought\nWell maybe he's right but it probably isn't I'm In the first question I asked is how come we just won a you a state Senate special election\nIn Texas state Senate seats in Texas were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent a Hispanic or and we want or the first time on a hundred and thirty nine years what's his explanation\nOr how come a mix Sally the Republican nominee and Arizona's now heads or how come that ah Kramer the Republican candidate in North Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points up in his in\nTennessee is people who had to realize the British and actually the Democrat actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you could get a to a government run health system brain assumed starting to fall apart and Tennessee is going to end up ... getting a sense of\nYou know something out of self sabotage and say ah where's the where's the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races and some of these governors races the one that I'm really watching is they Andrew Gillum\nVersus Ron I'm a dissent is because for me and for so many of watch the growth of Florida and how well it's been a run by Rick Scott and\nAnd to me that the idea of turning that state over is critical is that state is that a country electoral politics to a guy who's basically a socialist is just that just cannot happen and yet he's getting millions and millions of dollars nude from the usual suspects\nCharlie Chaplin I mean you'll um is\nUm [noise] the latest great hope because he came out of nowhere as radical Democrat he won an upset victory a heat the key temporarily looks very good\nI think you'll be fading day by day as this goes on but ... but when you say governorships remember that it was a study just came out the ten most popular governors in states\nAre all Republican every single one of the ten highest rated governors or Republican or the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the governor of Maryland hardly a rich state is gonna win in a landslide and the reasons exactly why\nWe're building a majority in the country\nThey get results\nThey don't just have resistance are they actually have things that work they don't just have fantasies and strange ideas and I think we have to be prepared to wage a campaign that drives home again and again and again\nThe difference between a the kind of left wing fantasies that are not you can't afford them you can implement them a long run they're not going to work\nAnd I think that's one of our key jobs this campaign is to draw the distinction between results and resistance\nAnd certainly the attorney General Holder was a perfect example of the resistance says the alternative\nYeah I I really think and again\nI think those images of the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control\nOr I think that's I I don't think people like that they did not like everything Trump tweets or\nThey might be annoyed as some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds I what I get that but I think the this frenzy people want it all to calm down they just want things to calm down they want to come down on both sides\nAnd I so I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this ... thing and\nI think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place in a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into with you know fifty said pick up a so that's my sense of it in holders comments Maxine Waters\nI don't know I think all of it is it it gives people a bad feeling\nAnd I think you can draw the contrast you in here you have an economy which is booming at a level people said was impossible [noise] you know jobs being created your lowest black on unemployment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history or you have\nA remarkable achievers would deregulation you have solid conservative judges being appointed so every time you turn around right now you're seeing genuine results\nAnd then you have as you point out um people who seem crazed\nUh I mean is this really the America you want you really want people who come into a restaurant or harass people and drive them out you and people banging on the Supreme Court doors are and I and I think in some cases of course we know the George Soros and others actually pay for them which doesn't you know does that justify him\nBut the whole system that the left has tried to create I think is in the end or not a sustainable system\nNewt I Know you're doing a lot of uh advance before the midterm elections and there's one on October fifteenth\nUh where you can register to um attend an evening with Newt Gingrich and they'll be able to hear you talk about what's in store for the country what's at stake for the country in the mid term so how do people end up uh attending this do they do and and\nAnd and and let me let me just say also that we're we're very excited that they they can go to\nAn evening with new dot com and straight to an evening with Newt dot com Leo be when I was going to be they're talking about our American story and I'm going to take questions and frankly let the audience to direct me I'm going to put them sort of pick what are the topics we should talk about\nWell that's fantastic oh my gosh that's gotta be a lot of great an evening with new dot com so you can go there and uh to have a lot of fun and look it's time to it's time to stand up for the American you want and I think\nI think Americans are they have a good now\nBass detector note for an an artful way of saying it but I don't know who it was Trump's eccentricities

a means to an end that and is absolute power\nI think it's it's always been about power and the power is to change the American social construct\nThey want to destroy the foundations of this country so they can rebuild it and the way that they think it should have been built in the first place they hate the founding of this country they think the country was founded on corrupt principles and\nA

decades or what you're seeing play out now in the country is is worse\nThan you expected and are we approaching perhaps\nA Nineteen sixty eight style\nA type of frenzy in the streets\nWere borrowed beyond that now I think it's worse that I've seen in my forty five year journalism career basically a nexus of the media the corrupt media I'm ... now a promoting embracing um whatever word you want to use the\nMost\nEver seen in this country ever in the history of the country so you have\nA guy's like and everybody knows this named George Soros but others as well when I'm limited amounts of money who basically um formed organizations\nTo attack and destroy people with whom they disagree this is why it's different than the Tea Party or the uh hypocrites on CNN and MSNBC who you know from day to day will change their story depends on what they're told to do [noise]\nUm you have now a bevy of organizations so he saw it in a cabin or hearings\nThat send people out these aren't mob people these are targeted\nPeople who are paid to do certain things you know to confront senators in elevators or whether CNN camera right behind them to ah prevent um Senator Cruz and his wife from having dinner the these aren't accidents\nAre right to get Bill O'Reilly off the air not an accident mhm okay so you have this and in the past journalism reporters would have investigated it\nBecause this huge money behind it\nBut they don't now instead they promote it they're in business with the radical left in business with them\nCNN and MSNBC make money lots of it promoting the most radical progressive organizations in the country which will stop at nothing including violence to get political power so that's what we're looking at do you think that\nUh the president's handling of this ah\nThat's our and the way he's addressed it has been helpful has it been illuminating\nI don't think he knows what's going on\nIn the way I just laid it out to you and your listeners\nAre just don't think he knows what's going on I don't think he knows the seriousness look whenever you have organizations\nThat are in the shadows that people never heard of I'll give you one color of change our it and you've got twenty of them\nAnd they take their orders\nFrom big money to radical left people All right they say okay you pay us this and we'll do that the woman who confronted Senator Flake in the elevator is paid one hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nBy George Soros funded foundations\nWas widely reported Laura you're that Mm no no no okay and so\nPeople think it's spontaneous all this woman just showed up to yell at a flake because she's a victim or whatever she said she is that's that's what's happening and you know I I draw the correlation between what's happening in America now what happened in Germany\nIn the late Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties where you had a fanatical movement Nazi ism\nAccumulating power behind the scenes by violent methods and and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking away wasn't interested was engaged\nAnd the media in Germany basically we're afraid of the Nazis and they wouldn't tell the truth about that\nThat was more of a fear thing than a than a what we have now is that the media in America is ideologically in line with the progress ... their cause\nSo it was a little bit more extreme than the words of the New York times but not much\n[noise] so this big picture that formulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it\nUm and I'll give you another thing if I were President Trump I Would order an FBI investigation into the cabin or a debacle\nBecause I Know and I think you do to that it was no accident Dianne Feinstein held back that letter from Dr Ford for six weeks that was not an accident\nIt was no accident it was leaked against Dr Ford's wishes which I'm not exactly sure were sincere but let's say let's take it for face value that letter was linked putting the woman in danger and it was leaked\nBy somebody in Congress because only two people have the letter\nSo the FBI should be investigating that should get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they start that investigation which I Would order if I were president that scandal that whole thing is going to unravel fast because that was no accident what happened a cabinet\nAnd the women were all the women are all lying by the way they were all lying to I had a couple of people are looking into this who actually knew or knew both of them now now you know two of them and\nWhatever it was ... I went through this I went through this myself mhm right and and I saw things leveled against me that were insane\nAnd I you know at this point in this country people are going to have to want to make a decision by the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want they can do exactly what they want and they almost got cabinet they almost got him\nAnd this is a kind of country what\n... is is it you're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things they're not going to try to find the truth except it\nAccept it because it's an ... been in play now for quite some time so who do you depend on\nTo get the truth the only the apparatus is the criminal justice system\nAnd I'll put forth a President Trump should really see a bigger picture he takes everything personally any fights back effectively himself but I don't know if you see in the big picture what's happening here\nYou know once you start to erode basic rights like presumption of innocence ... process which you say they don't matter as the senator from Hawaii said hey don't matter\nDon't presumption of innocence of somebody accuses you of misconduct none you're guilty because in the past some women have been abused I mean think about it\nThey're they're attacking the fundamental rights that Americans have and have that\nAnd nothing what is what is being done nothing\nAnd I think bill you know I mean it's a division but I'm just so worried about it I Can't\nAm ... I Am petrified of this I I I completely agree with you and I was slammed for the last three weeks for saying just because someone alleges something and says this is my true that\nDoesn't mean that you can just say okay this person has to be fired this person has to be boycotted this person has to be a thrown to the to the curb denounced um put up on a cross crucified lose a promotion\nThis has got to stop that 'cause I got out but anybody well and it had happened it happened to me it has to have obviously things happening you look what happened to you things yeah and it it is a brutal on ...\nAnd where do you go to a regulation that way\nAnd there isn't anybody in place to rectify it although President Trump could do it by trying to get to the bottom of this cabinet mess my new column posted on Bill O'Reilly dot com as it is about this issue mhm is about ... exactly about how uh your truth has replaced ... bought truth\nOkay so ... and I and I take it off the University of North Carolina which now wants to honor Christine for ... and and I I mean I never comment on a doctor for one way or the other because I don't know what happened\nI'm I'm I'm interested in the people behind her ... you know I first got flag to this when she her letter was leaked and immediately she hire the most radical left attorneys in the country\nAnd I said to myself if you're a victim of an assault is that where you go no\nVinyl siding is a great way to update the look of your home and save on your energy bills with cedar ridge composite siding for ... brothers your home will be four times more insulated been with ordinary citing cultural brothers today for a free estimate\nCalled Jones brothers you'll be glad you did\nFrom\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center says is W.

I'm probably seven students about Seventeen on that in a car loan and then a lot of credit card so\nMhm [noise] so you have a question yes my question is I'm obviously should I think I Know you have to be okay you know you may not use student loans to pay credit cards\nOkay do you have any advice on my income about sixteen and twenty thousand dollars a year with my major thing I'm such just kind of on manageable right now\nMhm okay well you're first goal is of course to eat and keep the lights on your second goal is finished school when we finished school\n[noise] um I Will be finishing next summer\nSo about ... about a year okay less than a year good so you can tread water till then an ad no more new debt that's a victory\nOkay then the second thing would be to pay the actual payments on their credit card just minimum and we'll call that a victory uh and then the third thing would be if you can actually start to make some progress paying down on those you don't you're not paying anything on the student loans while you're in school right\nNow I have I only have leverage to pay off credit card\nYeah how to stand and it's a really really dumb idea okay you're making a mess and so have you cut up these credit cards\nUm I Know you haven't caught them all up [laughter] yeah I don't you\nOh stop using them you have to stop this stuff radically and then the second thing I'm going to tell you that you probably need to work more or at a different place\nWell it can't work more because their life called agile and out of the hospitals and probably make about ... area where I'm located okay well\nA little more money on another thousand dollars a month to change your life\nUh-huh\nSo that's what I'm looking at is what what can I Do to create that just on the short term you only got about nine months to your income can change hopefully with a new um\nWith a new job at a new career at that point um but hang on until then and stop borrowing on student loans to pay off credit cards Naomi is in Seattle hang Naomi how are you\nAn editor thank you sure how can I help um though\nMight have been run the small business from home I'm an accountant and bring in as much as it used to the passing declining steadily and ah so I'm Wondering do we used our home quit to get another job\nYes um what's wrong with the ... was dying\nA I'm not sure it did anything we used to make a combined it two thousand a month and now with the business it's gone to five thousand dollar home mortgages large chunk of what we are now\nOkay I'm a little bit confused 'cause you modeled everything together so how much of the Fifteen thousand was you\nUm about three months [noise] are you still doing that yeah\nOkay so he was making twelve and now he is making seven\nYeah no no no no no no\nNo I was making nothing his business has almost disappeared yes you do know what's wrong with it what's wrong with it\nUm I don't know what I have to talk to him I feel like a chip competition and ah he he didn't\nFeel that the market it's a lot of online staff of the market flooded with what you think ... um\nWhat what does he do he sells clothes on line okay\nAnd in the last year will go on so many people enter the clothing online business that weren't there before and I'm not letting her up Ninety percent of his income\nAt that appears to break and then you get a job or needs to fix this business\nSelling to home and option 'cause no because there's an fix the problem the homes not the problem the problem is is businesses failing\nOkay\nAnd we have to either fix that we have to identify the problems with his business and make the changes to fix the business or we have to get a job and close the business\nWhile I don't care if he starts selling something other than closing obviously knew how to sell something on the Internet at one point he was doing very well\nI got another he's making a hundred and fifty a year\nYeah that ain't bad three years you know that ain't bad so I mean he knows how to do something with marketing on the Internet some kind of digital marketing\nAnd uh it may be the product line he's into the space cesium yacht invaded or maybe he's got lazy with is is a you know when he's not handling is is digital marketing properly or I don't know I Can't tell what's going on but I can tell you this is it in the head and the right way is it\nYou know it's not\nSo I'm going to give up my friend Henry Cloud wrote a book called necessary endings\nGame and in that chapter in one chapter in the book he says that when you end something a relationship a job business whatever it is when you in something it's when it's bad and you have lost hope you have no reasonable logical reason to think it's going to get better\nI mean if you if you've been one of the guy who's been drinking for Twenty years and he says he's gonna quit there is no logical reason to believe him a unless there's evidence to indicate he actually has quitting this time\nAnd you you know you're married to a drunk you've got to make a decision at that point right in your case with this thing this thing's trending the wrong way you have to give me a logical if I knew\nYou and him when I look at this and say look at yourself in the mirror and say is there a logical reasonable good reason that says that that we can turn this thing around if we turn these three knobs and get this business working\nThen we have to change the business or something different or we go get a job\nThanks for the rams sheer [noise]\n\n\n\n\nThings are getting ... anywhere it out there I thought the

can I help yeah so I'll Try and keep it straight to the point I'm I've been living in my car on and off for about two months I was homeless for about two weeks since my car had broken down\nUm and I'm just wondering\nMoney has become one of my biggest ... and I'm just curious what advice do you have some ... in this situation again like family financially stable or maybe we struggle with money I'm currently working to restaurant jobs a one of them just caught by ships on the other one\nI don't make a ton of tips has a survey about I'm just wondering I'm twenty three year old I'm\nAt this point in life I don't really want to\nEver be in a situation because my physical health spiritual health mental health it's all going down since I lost ... which is one thing for some advice as far as what do you are out of that happening again\nYeah so you're single okay and when did you leave your parents' home\nAlso have been living on my lap and is a an eye on for about a year and a half but I moved to BC and once I got to be see I was in a car accident mhm\nMy money that I had probably ... or ... ah my vehicle effects by vehicle and then it was great the middle of summer\nAnd I wasn't able to secure work until shortly it may be on later I was living in a homeless shelter ... an hour east suddenly the shelter a big spending by like it's been on [laughter] but um where his home yeah I'm I parked by the ocean and I don't know\nWhere where do your parents live\nAh my mom lives about three hours away but she has a boyfriend going to counter me being there isn't really a [noise] it's very tough\nTough living in ... on our only been a ... a health issues right you know living in your car is tough\nThey don't have another bed well I mean you don't pick up much space as long you're going\nTo be like a smaller vi\nI'm so they're basically homeless to\nCauses you to be able to move the needle causes you to be able to move forward when you think the light at the end of the ... at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train your paralyzed your stop your overwhelm your frozen you get paralysis or the analysis that hopelessness\nWhen you think that the light and the tunnel is the way out of your trap then you run to the light\nBut if the train is coming at you and run to that obviously right\nAnd and what's the difference in those two events both light both a tunnel both the situation one is you believe that if you run with a lot you're going to get out one of you believe you run to the law you're going to get killed right I mean so that's hoping hopelessness\nAnd all of us me included face that or have faced that at times in our lives\nAnd it's amazing to me the power of our brain and our spirit that God gives us to do things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that are possible\nThat's called hope\nAnd so when I show you look you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you got thirty thousand dollars in debt you feel stock but gosh if we did that at a thousand dollars a month you're going to be out of that in my ... and a thousand dollars a month out of a hundred thousand is nothing I swam thousand dollars a year you're going to be out of debt and a little over two years\nAnd you suddenly go oh I see it ... it's the same situation you were in but now you can see it you see what I'm Talking about and once you can see it that's called hope I can see my way out one of the things that steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective\nPerspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\nIt's happened to me it's happened to you\nI remember one time one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was very upset like the world is coming to an end her mom and I are trying to\nQuit laughing so we can walk in and comfort\nHer [laughter]\nNow why are we standing in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nYou see things that she doesn't see because we've been in place as she has a man and have experiences that she doesn't have right so we've been to our twenty year class reunion we know she'll be glad he didn't call [laughter] that's what we're giggling about standing and All right so we have perspective\nAnd so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\nThen you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer\nAnd it's it's going to grow some things in your future you know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you that there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different than when you look out ten seconds\nAnd the young man I was just talking to an end folks that have dealt with the homeless situations is one of the problem was the the desperation just to eat and not being cold causes you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments of thought to I can stand back from that sitting here warm\nAnd with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see he couldn't see that you know you don't care that he wasn't getting it\nIt's like go go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go walk dogs go shovel something somewhere you know go do something do you know work all the time because as soon as you do that money comes from work is where it comes from I Can't get enough hours woven work someplace else work more\nWork all the time but by because I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does mean our\nWhen we were going broke I too little babies and wives houses in foreclosure were that close to homeless ourselves\nSo how we get out of it or their mind off\nAnd well you know you can't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out I went bankrupt but I didn't lose the house and if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that or you know ... and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter\nOnly thing is just perspective as like I didn't grow up rich but I had a friend that grew up rich and\nBecause he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out 'cause it it always worked out and I had the perspective that angle or guy [laughter]\nIt's gonna be awful ... and ... because he thought everything was always going to work out you know it all worked out a lot because I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes it didn't work out you say you set yourself in these tracks and these rockets with this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it\nIt's when you can't see the other side of it that you don't want to work through it because you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same way different issue is your perspective as I'm challenge and some of your another think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this\nMarriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\nYou're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film strip you're going to turn the page and something else is going to happen\nI'm not going to stay the same you are not stuck so look the other side of it look out there five years look out there are three years look out their ten months and say one of I got to do what's got to be true that is not true right now\nFor me to never be here again that's a question he was asking but he was having trouble emotionally buying it\nAnd I don't think I helped him a scholar bother me that's why I Want to talk about a minute I'm not sure he heard me\nBut if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away where everything had been through I had no identity no I ... you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long\nBecause they don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this that I'll be out\nAnd I work my way right out of it I don't I don't know how long it takes but how we get there I push my way through it\nHaven't always been that way there's been times that I was so scared so beat up and so hopeless that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see what I'm Talking about here is ... is is vision site that gives you hope when you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it\nThen then there's no you know that it's hard to take action\nIt it's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you got to do a series of steps you've got to take to become unstuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm stuck\nI think that guy's going to be okay I really do I think he's going to

myself floating on the ceiling looking down at my body in bed\nBut you know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience has there is a neurologist in Montreal Dr ... field who is April ... who is mapping out the different areas of the brain and he if he put on like trickle stimulation on the right tempo cortex he was able to produce and out of body experience [noise]\nBut that doesn't tell me the out of body experience originates in the van that tells me that the that ... will protests the out of body experience\nUm and you know the types of out of body experiences we had was quite straightforward um they weren't complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral\nProjection around novel\nPeople can leave not just their their body but they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAbsolutely now do you find that the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not\n[noise] I'd say no not not not initially because when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a believer I didn't even know such a thing as possible\nAnd I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go along and as I have these experiences um another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old and has the second year medical student I dreamt of us ... exam before the exam\nAnd when I went to the exam the next day the first question on the exam at the same as the first question in my dreams\nOften you have the answer that you knew exactly so I felt like that dream helped me past my exam but I didn't tell anyone about it because it seems so unbelievable\nIn fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have believed in\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with the subtitle our clinical psychiatrist you by the way these stigmatized says paranormal phenomena told me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this book because you know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena\nBecause what I found and this is my own experiences well when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people are gonna think they're weird or their strange for there's something wrong with them or they're losing their mind is something like that\nBut I'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences is quite normal to have these experiences\nI mentioned that the word parent or a month for example the ... pero mean beside so we'd have paralegals where it can be fed lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on the parent normal means beside normal it doesn't mean have normal\nAnd there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give a reading or if I give a talk film where people come up to me afterwards and share it with me things that have happened to them which they've never told anyone\nSo I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about these things and that was really what motivated me to read the book\nDid you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died they Dr shift speaker curricula\nNo I'm not familiar with him who she or her or her in the it was my aunt and\nDiversity by and she got her degree in psychiatry yeah and specialized in all kinds of things and then decided\nShe was giving all that up to study telepathy and when that's all she did she wrote a couple of books was called breakthrough the creativity but she was convinced\nTotally convinced that the luck of the was the real deal and the and again the psychiatrist seen that and so you're the only only other psychiatrist I Know that has really jumped into this\nOh I'd like to look for that ... that sounds very interesting on\nBreaks through to creativity I'm\nDefinitely gonna look for it but you know they're in 'em ups written by physicians but near death experiences for example even Alexander ... who's having yeah and his nearest surgeon\nAnd marry the meal she ... she's in our therapeutic surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks he's in there were all just he wrote a book called how these nations so physicians have written about these things but I haven't found another ... who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy that so I mean she she just do the the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away in a very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in a radio\nFell than there oh no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show her no that's terrible it was just going to owe more on\nHow does he get them interested in a lot of the\nTeachers to always wires and uh there were so many things that had happened to her and she just decided there's something to this and she's going to study it and she she went into it and the big white [noise]\nWell that's good well I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor these medical center in New York\nWhen they were studying deemed telepathy the ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in this study they had Sanders and receivers\nAnd maybe the rates were in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to the teeth I'm DJ could measure what we call him sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the ... dream state the Centers for giving random images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on the images I Try to send them to be the face and they found that people were more susceptible to ... to ... the when the receipt\nAnd it's also true that people are more susceptible to telepathy when they went through hypnosis so there are ways to augment telepathy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happened spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the more Dr Mandy majors where those his book the borders of normal\nCoast to coast am is now available I bone and now\nEnjoyed for not only listen live on demand anywhere anytime\nGo to close to ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n[noise] that said a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative\nUm that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh there's someone ... you mentioned her name she was out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWas dying patients and they found a lot of these patients um had someone who is coming to take them\nAnd they called they didn't call them vision they called them visitors and as they got closer to death is visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting [noise]\n[noise] so yeah I think those those deathbed visions of very common and I was one interesting thing about death bed visions is that sometimes there are shared by people at the bedside there was one case of a woman in India who is dying and\nShe says someone a deceased relative who came to take her to the other side and every three sisters who are at the bedside also saw the same person\nJeeze that's the that's an unusual though isn't it\nIt's unusual but there's been several cases like that three in some cases where the medical personnel at the bedside\nThought the same vision that the dying patients on\n[noise] and that's interesting because you know people who have death at vision the skeptics would say well that's because they're on medication or because they're confused or because they have a shortage of oxygen is the lack of oxygen to the brain they tried to get some kind of physical explanation part\nBut the divisions are shared than those explanations wouldn't be valid because the people at the bedside wouldn't have a shortage of auction to their brains and they weren't on medication so [noise] um it's hard to know how to explain that\nAnd there again the people who have these visions aren't necessarily relievers\nAnd then Wednesday when Steve Jobs from apple computer died many you know he was quoted as saying oh wow oh wow right now what do you think he's he was making reference to\n[noise] well I Know some people who are dying tell their relatives they see a beautiful landscape beautiful vision you know\nI'm a a bright white light you know a spiritual beings you know I'm a feeling of unconditional love you know these are some of the things that I imagine that Steve Jobs is experiencing\nYeah that could be that could be now skeptics of course say what the you mentioned that you\nKnow it's the body itself is doing all these weird things near the mobile death how can we argue against that\nWell there was one study of um cardiac patients who had been assassinated after cardiac arrest\nAnd this study was done by a cardiologist and he's head of of the the patients who who died in where we have to pay to Eighteen percent of them had a new report it in near death experience\nBut it's that experience is due to lack of oxygen to the brain than they would have all had it because they all have a lack of oxygen the brain not just the ... a small percentage [noise]\nSo you know that's one thing but then the other thing is that um these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U.S there's a lot of cross cultural studies that show that these experiences are in many different countries and they've been getting reported throughout time\nAnd one study looked at patients who are on medication\nVersus patients who weren't on medication and the patients who weren't on medication who weren't confused and who didn't have a shortage boxed into the brain had the same experiences and were able to report them just as often as the other patients so [noise] um people are skeptical and I think for a good reason and I think it's good to be skeptical\nBut it's also good to keep an open mind\nWell that's that's true in ... you you've talked about under deathbed the visions that\nThey sometimes see a little bit more than just a family member they see other kinds of visitors as well explain the\n[noise] well the other visitors aside from family members they could be someone that they were very close to or sometimes they report angels coming\nTo the others I'm coming to take them to the other side um especially with children and there was a pediatrician mouth and Martha Stewart is dying children and he said the dying children didn't report\nDeceased relative because their parents and their relatives and friends are all still living\nBut they've reported the angels that we're having to take them to the other side I had an experience at my father's funeral where I thought to angel is one of the other side of the cough and\nDid anybody else you\nKnow so I could say I know they were a product of my own brain no one I saw them but in my own mind I saw those angels and they were just as clear as day standing right in front of me\nAnd I had the idea that thought came into my mind that they were called minutes during angels and they had the idea that they were minister and my father to help them make the transition it's the next level the next world\nAnd they were the most beautiful creatures and I didn't know what to make that but actually when I decided I Need to start telling people about what's going on because that was too much for me to keep to myself\n... they see you\nI don't think so oh okay I don't think they were there for me I think there were there for my father\nThat's right now the other thing is when you say in terms of deathbed visions [noise] you know um\nIf they were produced by certain chemicals\nAnd live with the um visitors only ... the people who were deceased why wouldn't they be other people as well\nIs this thing is sometimes these visions of these people they are the person is dying doesn't know there may be a a brother or sister who had died as the case where there was a car crash and ... all one brother died and the other brother was near death\nSo the the brother that was near death\nHad the vision of his dad but it but he hasn't been told that his brother had died in the same max didn't he didn't know that there was dead and the amount of the cases like that to where the the deathbed visitors the prisoners dying didn't know that that person was actually dead but because of the family wanted to spare them the knowledge\nPre cognitive dreams give us your thoughts on what they are\nWell then again I've had the cognitive beams I mentioned one above the very powerful\nAbove yeah exactly they're very powerful and the question is how do we know of a dream is a pre cognitive beam or if it's an anxiety dream because often and you know when people are sleeping during the dreams they tried to protest things that happened during the day or things that they're worried about\nSo you know for example I talked about Abraham Lincoln two weeks before he was assassinated he he had a dream that he was murdered that we could say that that was a peak cognitive dream that we could also say that could have been an anxiety dream maybe he was worried that someone was going to kill\nHim maybe I think you also had a dream where he was in the White House and he walked up to the soldier who is standing by casket and it was him in the casket\nI heard that too yeah yeah so that could have been ... cognitive being but another famous person who reported a pay current good to be much Charles Dickens really I didn't hear that\nYeah 'cause when he would put a new book you travel around the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before he was to give her reading into a new town where he'd never been before he had a dream that\nI'm a group of people came up to him after his reading and a young woman in red Shaw introduced himself to her with forwards she said I Am ... Napier so when he woke up he thought that was very strange she didn't know anyone by that name but he reminded the dream was very vivid\nAnd free cognitive beams tend to be very vivid\nI'm often when we wake up in the morning I Dream start to fade the pre cognitive dream stay with us and maybe member every detail so the next day he went to give its reading and sure enough after the meeting a group of people came up to him and there was a young woman wearing a red Shaw and she was introduced to him as ... Napier\nSo so this stream was a pretty cognitive dream and he didn't know what to think of it or how to explain it but he he ... he had that ... [noise] so um it's some people if he ... he's a person has written about yes\nCommissions and the climate it beams and he's written a boat when should we pay attention to a dream how do we know if it's going to be or not and he said we should pay attention to dreams first of all agreements week current or if it's especially vivid or if it involves death\nI heard of a case recently where um this woman told her husband ... that she dreamt that she and her children died during a terrorist attack and this is a number of years ago\nIn the house who thinks cleaning my house is very minute\nEnron chime bring their own supplies do everything from ... residential to post construction cleanup southern belles cleaning service five or six zero seven ... find them on Facebook southern belles cleaning river region\nChevrolet Master control centers this is W.

all\nMorning I'm so glad to be on your show I Am one into 'em they thank you for your guest here I um had a really\nStrong very powerful encounter before Princess Diana passed away and um I Dreamed about her I visit her for like two weeks every night and my sleep and she gave me the whole like he did like\nToward the end I was driving in a car and having lunch and tea and we just talk and we just communicated\nHit it off huh\nWe just hit it off and when that night that she died I was sitting on the couch was bad weather we're having form and I was doing laundry can sleep and I just knew something was wrong and then when I thought everything happening on the TV screen it just was\nLike so surreal it was just\nThat was a bizarre time which\nNever had anything like that ever happened to me um I don't know if anyone else we've never had that kind of I mean it sounds like what you're talking about two and then for my son died I had the same thing I had the vision of ... a dream for like two weeks\nAnd just couldn't sleep an uneasy feeling and to cop coming to his dad's door horrible and I didn't know what to think of it and it was just\nI've never had anything else like that happen [noise] um so I'm I'm I'm familiar with\nNo I I it only happens in close people to me when if they're going to die I kinda know I you know I kind of know things like you do tell them\nWell I'm now I Know I don't know who's going to die I just can't\nReally just somebody's gonna die\nI just it um I get very I started crying crying you know I get very emotional and very sensitive and just crying and at that but not sure why many what causes that\nFits don't want to say I'm Sorry to hear about your son\nAnd I mean ... um if you've had any post death contact with him now anyway but now I have not any contact with him since he died\nNow I have not and several people my daughters and several other friend path but no I have not in that very travelling [noise]\nOkay well in terms of your question [noise] George what causes that well I guess I Would call that a a pre cognitive dream or premonition [noise] you know and I think it's related to the well on a theoretical level you could say on one level we're all connected\n\nAnd somehow we're able to communicate with each other in a way that we're not really aware of you know I'm I think that especially someone very close to family members as the you know a child or a sibling or parent or a spouse\nThat people want to communicate with the deceased loved one is it easier to be a little more aggressive to try to communicate with them or do you laid back and let them try to come to you\nI Would say that the ladder I Would let them come to you know because they may not be ready\nYou have to give them any signs that you're already\nWell you have to I think you have to say that you're open to the experience and that you would love to hear\nFrom them and then the ball is in the airport\nLet's go to Virginia cancer with us welcome to the program Keith\nHi George how're you hey there good can you hear me okay pretty good\nOkay great I'm\nTo lead to a couple of things one last night with your guest I called in but uh to get on\nAnd ah it there are some commonality and some of the topics tonight about um the paranormal and I'm hoping I consider to be quite a link between paranormal and the\nAh Judeo Christian teacher of the Bible or missing link couldn't be a the content of a book called eternal man and\nAnybody can go bad or search it on YouTube or Amazon\nYou can find different lectures and things about that and [noise] over the years time this book written by a BYU religion on ... professor and over the years I was just listening to coast to coast it's just been quite remarkable that\nThere there is no much of the paranormal uh that that can be clarified and expanded upon perhaps\nIt gives some understanding about this of of the journal nature and our spiritual nature as well and um to switch to another topic really quick ... I'm\nA ... years ago I had a dream and it could've been induced by listening to the coast to coast a lot about your experiences I've had two friends who passed away only about I think Thirteen Days apart from each other at about ... ...\nI mean it was very vivid now this dream as from about\nThirteen Years ago I think and ah I can still remember today um I don't remember what happened before the then some of the dream and I don't remember what happened after the event of the jury and Marjory ... but it was a very vivid\nAnd I want you to hold that thought in an era Taylor fraud in your consideration about the possibility of\nA mystery in the of Dr Christine Blasey Ford about the events that she had happened to her but yet all the people that she mentioned not a single one of them you know anything about fat and\nA dream that I had was that um I was up my my brother's apartment where the second round of the passed away playing basketball one night with my brother and and um he at the end of\n'em this time the jury found to a broader me off the later and he looked at me and I'll see you and Thirteen months and I knew he was dead wrong him why\nI'm a pretty young lady that was wearing a charcoal grey quote and quote\nStanding next to him I didn't know who that was seen her before\nThis was in a in a dream\nThat sort of the orange rain and ah and I thought you know and and every you know the people that I don't know the dream were\nLike all of a sudden and be a ...

borders of normal and many when you're putting in the book together was there are some part of it that just overwhelmed you that you did not expect that you came across when you were researching it and put it together\nI think the most interesting thing was a deathbed vision [noise]\nYou know because I left that thing that I didn't realize how common that way [noise] you know we've we've certainly heard a lot of uh near death experience and vision and now the body and associated with near death experience but I wasn't ready and million with the death bed in on the vision of deceased loved ones that are also very um and\nThe death bed visions do you think it's the body's way of making death a little more comfortable for people or is it something that is strictly outside of the physical brain\nI think it's both I think it's a combination\nBut the the aspects that are still really current and a current applications that you could ... an hour to do that\nWell first of all your first question how do you know the demons acting in your favor well I'd say is is the content of the dream a warning you know is it something that can be helpful for you and your daily life is telling you about something that's\nComing up for you and your life or is it about another person so I'd say it's acting in your favor first of all if it's a boat you not about another person\nAnd if it's and they the accidents beneficial now in terms of Kenya cherry pick I Would say yes because they can be some super fluid through extraneous materials in the dream is not necessarily related to the main point of the dream [noise]\nSo I think to a certain extent you have to take out those parts of the dream which you feel applied to in which can be helpful for you and your daily life\nIs that al ...

absolutely Thanks Mark my bearer his website his name my bearer B. A. R. A. dot com\nNo that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on a trip that's right well what did the indicators I mean the market the last two days is really taking it on the Jim what's the cause for that is that just panic or ... what's happening\nWere well two things in and actually they both relate back to the good old Donald hum last week you saw 'em treasury bond you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year\nBonds shoot up I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this would happen we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks above through three point two percent\nIn in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and stock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values\nAnd higher or lower it so that was the first thing that happened but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean is this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating and a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing hair that's going to trigger a worldwide a down turn and crash and so so it was rising interest rates\nAnd um and then and more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about for the last month at twenty six forty\nI'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp rally for years and has been waiting to go back and we said look at breaks twenty six forty that that's a sign that China is starting to go down again\nAnd it and it did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and then again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates no the interest rates was the first whack\nThese last two days had a lot more to do with China and Trump\nIs really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways and Trump has been losing the economy would tax cuts and all that sort of stimulus and stuff and that causes inflation to go up which it has\nAnd it causes growth to go up temporarily and what does the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do it the comedies overheating they raise interest rates if\nIt's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous\nAnd and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I created this great thing and the trumps wrecking at no this was predictable he's not\nYou know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences of things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pulled back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose what happened here ... we had a couple more days of downturns I mean tomorrow we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people start saying there's something wrong here\nYes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a correction like this at the beginning of the year ... market peaked in in late January real kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough\nWe have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent and different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kinda like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nOf what happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling ensuring the market it happened very quickly you'll see you know I've seen this the last seven\nStock bubbles throughout the history of everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash and then every other one in the last century including the tech correct in recent bubbles\nThat first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half months\nAnd the way people get whacked and that's the sign that\nFinally birth the problem is by the time that comes people are already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked card so\nWe did the danger sign is if we keep going down and and and literally I the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just a bounce after you know fourteen hundred points that may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far\nBut it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers Seventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand um about\nIf the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders\nAre going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy eighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash will happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make Bible so dangerous [laughter]\nI'm a you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross trial once and then when somebody asks what what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early because that's how this ... this is a bubble this isn't a normal bull market\nThat correct center nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and they crash and and half the time and they crashed twice a is dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of vent and it it the signs to me you're building we'd been telling people man this looks like a top here in the garden top here and we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge as if we only get a normal ten Fifteen Percent or so correction by the end of the year then we're probably good for one more round one more Trump rally into next year before this thing blows but the\nRight now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period\n[noise] well this is worse because what's happened is if we did and we of course we were warning about that George ... decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking\nAnd then in and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries well what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and then their debt has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates in the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like went sideways and didn't deliver joined it emerging countries one on this free and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up the seat Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble China is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest that Bob ... of anybody in any time in history\nWhen China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so my view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand a two thousand nine recession and the stock crash because they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just filled the tobacco\nOr dead everything's more stretch the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have wars crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be war so instead of like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty\n... absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad Harry stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back carry us down for those his website is his name Harry Dent D.

T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff the sale of a lifetime and zero\nCoast insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available Dr bone and know Android ... job\nListen Leiber on demand anywhere any time\nI go to coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThey're good things um but and then and you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a Super Bowl I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half\nSix or seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked in a while\nWell companies like apple and Amazon beautiful on Amazon there oh my God I was you know like a you know a hundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies\nAnd you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also go down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash\nWent down Ninety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so that's the secret and and the other thing is even if the earnings of companies if companies are so good that they keep their earnings fly instead of declining\nThe valuations on stock how many times earnings white people will pay thirty times earnings for the typical stock for an hour forty in in sixty or eighty for the best taxed on\nThose collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down fifty percent even if its earnings don't declined and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator looking at some of these dangers what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know it's not a secret anymore well I Know I Know\nBelieve me Wall Street won't pick this anyway so you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened to their the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stopping in and then when things go down there the ones to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors are bones were bought in stocks are about they're the ones that short for his\nI mean they're in the know and and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks they eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff\nWell they you can measure\nThis action or that there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index and what they do is that dumb money ... acts\nIn the morning the first thirty minutes I mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures markets there ahead of everything\nAnd so the market's gonna open down it opens down right at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves me well that's when the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect them so\nThat's one of those reactions made that's the money\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes so they measure this indicator measures but the smart money is doing versus a dumb money and the smart money\nThat has not bought this rally in fact they'd been show where they get they been betting against this rally ever since a bottom February this year after that crap now they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to January top early this year\nBut one sec crash happen they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is\nDeclines and smart money buying and that\nHas been a strong warning signal to me uh in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico now\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went through hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here\nAnd Michael both of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours and Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blown off all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything\nOh it's it's like can you know God got angry or something you know and that threw a temper tantrum she'd moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and coal labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has ... in ...\nTo islands that are like St Thomas and or or St Croix or St John\nAnd and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there in in I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family\nFor many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place\nSpending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade was when I first started coming and I said to my why don't we move here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality on a corner of the price of South Beach Miami where we used to live and and\nWe're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport which I get to twenty\nMinutes an advance they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're going to ... I'm not sure I liked that part well\nIt's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane flight it scenic I'm On I leave my condo during and landing on this island in one hour and once I got down here I realized I could qualify\nFor some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living and the crypto guys are coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses can qualify there's real strong tax advantages so I'm living much cheaper than a man of great climate I can still fly to New York\nIn four hours director Miami in two hours and then almost anywhere in the east coast is now it's difficult to um coming out your way but I have to go out to California\nWhich I just did it for a long pole ad that the long haul now but I tell ya I I like it down here they've been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years\nWe're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent ear and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next to so many years\nThe big banks down there\n[noise] yeah yeah yeah about in in ... down here and it actually love the banks are buying banker popular and Santander or Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but they there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service\nSo people either just because they think we're in Zimbabwe or they charge some huge X and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like yeah but otherwise man this is a good deal and\nYou know I'm Down here for other reasons but I tell you people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower\nUm I Believe they vote in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that that they are allowed to vote in our elections\nMost important they are allowed to freely mover immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and have much better job opportunities and then when they get older and have kids I guess what they do a lot of Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico\nSchools or medical school here and save a ton of money and then sometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving\nTo the United states why sixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids\nAre in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants from Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people that's why they have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides and the U.S\nIs better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized Puerto Rico because the U.S as always always rubbing their best people and again it's it's they're more professional educated people that are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\n[noise] so I Want you to you is your best impressions on what you think will happen economically over the next year this country seems to be mired right now here in a conflict\nEmotion it's unbelievable I've never seen it this way yeah and I think it's going to affect the economy one day\nThat it does it's another reason I'm kind of happy to be here and watch what's going on this was a major theme for the first time in his zero our book\nThat they were not just seeing a major boom peak globally and a major bobble and debt bubbles and all this de leveraging it and that that's going to make the next couple of years very did what you do to leverage debt these bubbles burst I mean again somebody stock account is worth two hundred thousand one day and then a year or two later it's worth fifty thousand you know like what happened\nTo be a guard soldiers stand ready to serve an all time for family for community for country to learn more log on to the national guard dot com\nOr contact in the Army National guard recruiter in your area sponsored by the Alabama Army National guard haired by the Alabama broadcasters association and decision making me feel really like [noise]\nI think if there weren't enough to feed them and I ...

country that's why they want to bring in the immigration from areas that are from areas that are compliant\nBecause people who come I mean if your grandparents and great grandparents are Americans ... meaning they were here in the Nineteen twenties the Nineteen tens the Eighteenth fifties\nThere are different breed of folks that exists around the rest of the world these were people who came to the United states before the social welfare state\nAnd these were people who came to United States with a full understanding that they might not survive the voyage here but it was worth it on the off chance they made it they could make a life for themselves these are people who came here knowing that they would have to survive the first winter before they could get out there and harvest the field and get a job\nAnd they were willing to do it because they had something deep inside their body deep inside their genetic code deep inside their DNA that long for freedom that long for individual

come from that stock you come from a from a a a a breed of person who wants freedom who doesn't want to be taken care of from cradle to grave\nAnd I'm not sure those people are ever going to buy in

wrong I mean I'm not naive\nBut I'd say eighty plus Ninety plus percent of the babies being a border to come and have to come in from families who would have been raised as leftist who would have been

[noise] they're just not\nOr they're putting it off so late they might be able to squeeze one child out you know by the time they get forty five and so when you when you look at conservatism and and liberalism and who's going to be able to take control over the next forty ... let's say thirty forty years I think conservatives believe it or not have a much better opportunity\nThe only way the Democrats can do it is to immigrate their way to a majority\nThe only way liberals can ever be a majority of the country if you call people on the phone nationwide and you ask them are you a conservative or liberal some people were refused to answer but does that answer five to one will be conservative or liberal [noise]\nPeople are embarrassed to admit their lives [noise] can't take care

push the bans tourist start date back a few months to allow him the opportunity to put out his album tour for a few months to support his album and uh and they said no\nThat's fine I'll just to or would you guys when he did the opening show January twenty six Radio City Music Hall [noise]\nUm and then when then he said well I'll just do my tour in open dates so if you'd have like a friday and a Thursday or a Thursday and friday data up to her in a city nearby like on Monday or Tuesday or something\nUm and and they kicked him out of the band\nThey said no we're going on with that you wrote a\nWhich is incredible because he wrote the vast majority of all for music either\nHe ought to be suing to keep them from using his music and then what are they going to do then I came to her\nThey go around saying a bunch of Christine degree songs I mean you know when there's four of them nobody would show up for that at the ... when you go to the bathroom and get your beer I mean that's nobody shows up for that um anyway I thought\nI thought that was an interesting friday conversation they're interesting friday conversation or Fox News keeps going back to the story in Turkey\nYou know the pastor or the American pastor that's over there Andrew Brunson you followed this country follows it always been a couple of years [noise] right in prison are all on terrorism charges they're allegation is he was helping people\nAh get healthy and operate sort of a cause I hospital I think was the allegation if I remember correctly um to go fight in Syria\nAgainst against Turkish interest and um to turkey detained them kept him a Obama did nothing for them or ... basically lessen their language just like they did that poor guy or the Hillary Clinton\nThe or the the old like Darrell pass good guy and in Iran you know they didn't do anything to get him out well Trump finally got involved in Turkey has been in the knee and he's applied maximum pressure here uh by using things like a reduction in finds that turkey\nOwes given us a given some waivers\nOn turkey purchasing some crude oil from Iran a and potentially vouch for turkey for some IMF support down the road in order to get this pastor Andrew Brunson out of the country and it seems to be successful turkey is still going to prosecute them but they're going to do it in ...\nAnd he's going to be allowed to leave pending trial and he will not have to return for sentencing\nSo that's a\nThat's where he is that's where he is again\n... you know can I ask this question sure\nWhy you going to go into another country and stir up stuff\nIn there I mean I'm Sorry\nAnd this guy you know every every by probably be mad at me for saying this but if you're a pastor go there to do with pastures do don't go there doing running some underground operation and go fight the people that you're in the country with yeah I think why he's staying at me\nWell I think there's a there's a concern from from Americans and and people who have been following the story that those are all cover story for prosecuting him for being a past okay so he really was a good well we don't know I mean the reality is neither you nor I Know\nUh we do know he's coming home he will be in the United states soon\nUm but uh\nWe don't know what he was doing there he very well may have been doing exactly that my my thing is I'm all for the\nLike mission field work and you don't want to salute if you want to go to turkey it'd be a missionary that's fine uh it's an overwhelmingly Muslim country country\nIt's hostile it's led by dictator aired on who doesn't bend to public pressure foreign intervention or lightly and you need to go over there knowing full well\nYou know the apostle Paul when he was caught and eventually killed he didn't have an American president offering IMF support for his release they went over there full well knowing if I get caught in hostile Roman territory I Will be killed or I Will be in prison\nAnd so if you want to go do the pastor thing over there go do it but I understand we're not coming for you if you get caught you know I understand that position you know if you want to take that position that's a rational position I Do think the United states while we have clout should try to get these people just like we've got the north Korean prisoners out\nI think Trump does a good job of stuff like that\nI Do but uh but those are both those are both legitimate position your position also is very legitimate jak if you are a pastor at our mission field\nDon't go under the under the guise of being a pastor and basically be a spy country the ... I mean it's like yeah but if he you know that's not true then I don't know if I don't nobody really knows I think what is true\nWe just always coming home\nI'm senator Jeanne Shaheen from New Hampshire right now on the phone I'm guessing that's where he's from New Hampshire yeah this must be why else would anyone care what genes seeps down as the guy like goodness I I I wouldn't I wouldn't outlive you couldn't pay me to listen to not only would I not go watcher\nYou well I guess there is a price at which I'd go listen to the price would you do about about anything I guess\nA as a credit union locations all over the river region as a credit union has nine locations right here in the river region they also have five pounds and co op locations around the country holy macro five thousand go application that's an average of a hundred and every single state that's\nMore than one per county in every single state so just understand when you're dealing with a as a credit union you're dealing with a truly truly standup great organization\nThat has a a a network all over the country that can take care of you they're not going to charge you for your checking account absolutely free checking and what I mean by that is you don't have to use your debit card you don't have to keep a certain level of balancing there every month you put a dollar and they're never use your credit card they're never going to charge that just send you a statement every month\nI have a friend of mine whose dad looks just like Santana [noise]\nAnd he's a studio musician up in Nashville and he goes on to her as fake Santana [noise]\nAnd I didn't know any of it [noise] I mean I knew him growing up but I didn't know he had this whole new side gig is fake Santana [noise]\nAnd so she sent a picture one day of him sitting in her living room looking just like Santa Ana dress like em classes on your own as she says Santana car broke down on the side of the road and he came in\nWas the first indication of the big story\nTo offer them a beer and we sat there and talk for a while and I was like are you kidding me\nGotta minds you\nChevrolet Master control center says is W.

running on the Democratic ticket for a\nAttorney general or against a\nA guy I'd made no bones about that I'm a in opposition to I'm not saying I Would vote for Joe Stalin over Steve Marshall might I might but it but I like you you're you're good get someone takes me a moment ago and said I don't know that I can vote for him he's distracting handsome\n[laughter] ah but no I I uh you know you you've you've been campaigning you've gotten around a\nHave a choice between two Democrats basically yeah initially I mean truthfully I bet you didn't have an Obama sticker on your ... well I I'll tell you is sort of a funny story um so yeah he he was a Democrat up to a few years ago a as a private attorney I actually\nBrought an action against the Obama administration\nBecause I felt that that their department of justice was not adhering to\nA certain area law that that I Believe firmly they should so I actually may have been prosecuting or or or or in litigation against the Obama administration at a time that my\nNow Republican opponent may have been sporting an Obama bumper sticker social situation that that's a that's an interesting\nPoint um what do you um do you have anything that you want to do proactively what is like the ... the main thing that you would like to accomplish if you're elected well\nSomething that I have have said since I got into this race is is I Want the attorney general's office to be about people non politics or I Believe more than anything when you're\nWhen your principal job and responsibility as the administration of justice a and applying the law fairly clean and partially that it not only\nShould not matter the letter deer or in front of your name or or besides your name\nBut to do the job ride it frankly it can't matter\nAnd the reason why that is so important is because there are a number of issues that are facing a the state of Alabama where the attorney general can have a meaningful impact we've got this opioid epidemic that is getting worse and worse by the day you know we learned recently that\nAre over the last year Alabama had an increase in overdose deaths uh we have four counties in Alabama currently at risk of an HIV outbreak in two thousand Eighteen directly attributed to this this crisis\nIn Alabama we've got it got a human trafficking problem that I don't think many people realize the extent of it and we want to keep our\nParents and grandparents are free from fraud and abuse especially in the age of cybercrime keep her children safe in schools and in their communities and\nAll of these issues the attorney general can have a real real impact on and I'm there none of them are are partisan person issues and I want to go back just for a minute to the um the ethics issue and I don't want to dwell on it or like I said I Want every vote\nTo be for me not against somebody else is not about what my opponents done wrong it's about what I can do right but\nIt is difficult for people to have faith in their government especially their attorney general's office when he is so clearly violating\nCampaign finance law and yet at the same time\nHe is chairing or co chairing the ethics Reform Committee yeah and it just\nAt a base level at a base level the attorney general must be trusted to follow the law that he is applying to everyone else and uh I Want to move past that quickly so that we can start addressing these issues and and instill that mindset and attitude of independence and being about people not politics\nProtection are our number two seven to nine to ... an important division 'em and they got good folks over there I'm not knocking the division at all it's just they don't have the resources they need to protect Alabama consumers a lot of times and you get ripped off for you know twenty fifty eighty bucks it's it's not worth it to go down to file a small claims case\nA lot of those people used to turn to the consumer protection division and uh and and they just don't have the resources to help all those people any more\nUm you know the attorney general's office can help you from getting ripped off what ... what good are they frankly I'm number two seven to nine to ... for the third time my friend and I get sick and type in your name and the computer and I'm just kidding go ahead what's on your mind\nThank you for being there still are for us so we can ask questions that's very important to us out here in radio and when you're headed by west in jail understand that you're willing to indict prosecute\nThe current political are up in that we have going on in Alabama if you're here for the next day you understand as a ... that that is traditionally a pay to play state\nHorrible political corruption and the ... campaign contributions it caught the eye or option the contract of I Would like to go to a\nWhole accountable for the initiation it got the artist and what we greatly appreciate the ice here on that did not falling to the art\nOf shade if you would and it's like that and I'll hang up that list I Can't wrap back\nIt's a appreciate [laughter] is that a knock at your humble hose [laughter] uh I I Do appreciate the question and and uh as you said there's no there's no way to do this job or at least to do it right without being independent and non partisan\nA you know it's it's it's disappointing and it's unfortunate that my opponent has put himself in a position where he himself does not have credibility to bring these prosecutions because of his acceptance of\nThis three quarters of a million dollars but that violates our campaign finance laws and and you're right the corruption that we see is not\nRelated exclusively to campaign contributions how will tell you this um I Will be reviewing and and investigating a as allegations are made\nAnd the number one promise that I can make is that every decision that I make out of the attorney general's office or will be because of the merit\nAnd because it's in the best interests of the people the state uh there there will never be a decision made that um is made because of a political agenda and uh\nWhat we need the most as far as these political corruption cases the concern is is we need we need independents and we need confidence that that they are being investigated thoroughly and objectively and that's exactly what I'm going to do well I'm going to tell you one thing ethics commission gonna do it\nSo the attorney general's office is going to have to step up um there's\nBeen a gentleman's agreement among a different branches really between two the ethics commission the attorney general's office\nFor I don't know how long it's been it's been that way it was all the all through the Luther Strange administration and now they're Steve Marshall they basically have a gentleman's agreement a handshake agreement that [noise] the ethics commission would have exclusive original realm over\nAnything that fell under the ethics code so campaign finance a pay to play any of that kinda stuff the ethics commission sort of gets the first whack at it and if they determine it illegal\nOr that there is probable cause to believe it's illegal then they'll refer it over to the attorney general's office but there's nothing in the Alabama constitution of the statutes that say you can't as the attorney general investigated those things regardless of whether the ethics commission has passed on them or that says the ethics commission can get it wrong\nAnd we're going to pursue it anyway it too I mean if we had an instance um\nI don't want to say her name but it was it was a pet Todd where she was basically lobbying in the house she was paid lobbyist in the house now my ... going to prison for that\nScene because the ethics commission blessed it got away with it\nAnd the attorney general's office said well you know she's a nice person everybody seems to like er well okay nobody liked Hubbard I get it so he had to go to prison 'cause nobody liked him as bad personality now legal in Alabama I didn't see any difference ... between the two cases but the attorney general's office completely look the other way and let her get away with\nWell she asked come first and they gave the green line well I understand they might didn't ask\nAnother example another example where the ethics commission bailed out somebody uh we had a chief medical officer in the state is now the head of the hospital association while he was the chief medical officer in charge of regulating the medical industry in this state he's out in the ... a deal\nTo go lobby now you can't negotiate a deal to go work for somebody without an offer or an acceptance or solace station\nYou just can't he worked out nail down a contract and they got like three months after he nailed down the contract to finish up his job as the chief helping a direct I'm sure you know talking about waves and both of these people get off completely\nIt just seems to me that under Luther Strange and under state marshal the laws are being applied fairly they're not being applied even late to both parties to across the board good people and bad people nice people in in Maine people if you're breaking the law you're breaking the law especially on that scale it needs to be investigated and prosecuted and it frustrates me\nThat this gentleman's agreement has allowed the ethics commission to completely undermined the laws of the state of Alabama and Steve Marshall and Luther Strange both looked around with their hand in the rear end not knowing what to do about it you have backbone are you going to put an end of this practice\nSo you you've you've touched on a a lot of important a lot in our ... no no and then you're you're you're you're you're you're passionate about it is is\nWell placed and it's understood and you you touched on something that is at the core of my goal of running for attorney general which is to\nRestore faith and confidence in the decisions that are made and that nobody is left scratching their head or wondering was someone prosecuted or were they not prosecuted\nBecause of some reason other than the ... you know that has got to stop and and you're also right here when the law is clear the attorney general does not need to wait on the ethics commission to act and in the situation with these these illegal contributions of himself as accepted\nThe law is clear yeah I think his own office should be investigating without his permission\nThey ought to assemble a grand jury and take it in front of the grinder and let the grand jury decide and if they won't do it I don't understand why Darrell Bailey had done it has jurisdiction over under the constitution I'm confused on your choice to get to call was it a civil matter\nIt was a civil matter and there's no civil remedy that they can ... your bag he had no choice I understand he had no choice\nI mean but he didn't say it was legal right it's just you just said there's nothing I can enjoy it on the civil basis\nOr which is the ... I mean James is not an activist is the correct way to or judge Anderson is not an activist is the correct way to to be the case but it doesn't mean it was illegal contribution and I don't understand why Darryl bally's not convening a grand jury and have it at least them take a look at it anybody can look at the text of the law\nLook at the facts of what happened it would take you an hour to get an indictment I think\nWell and it it wouldn't wouldn't even necessarily take them that long I I'm ... I wrote a letter to the ethics commission\nOn the subject outlining exactly exactly what the law says and what the law requires and uh it was thoroughly documented and hope as well researched and and that's what's\nTruly disappointing and really just just sad about it is it that the law is so clear but\n... have you talked to have you reached out to Darrell Bailey office the district attorney Montgomery County or because the the ... under the constitution of Alabama Denver county district attorney has jurisdiction over ethics code violations\nI'm I'm gonna let let the district attorney make that determination for himself without without me weighing in a I Believe it's as if it's something that he believes is appropriate to pursue that he'll do so\nUm one thing that I Want to be very cautious of is a because even though the law is clear\nBecause I Am a political opponent I'd I Do not want there to be an appearance of a pursuit solely because of because of that and I think that makes sense yeah\nSense we're gonna take back to seven to nine to ... the number if you want to get in my friend Edward over at grammar fell over\nA rental properties wants you to get in touch with him if you're looking for a three bedroom three bath house Twenty one hundred square feet with hardwood floors at a washer dryer on site invisible fencing it's a very friendly very pet friendly the invisible fencing is incredibly\nThey uh I'll make sure he gets a professional trainer over there to help you\nThrow that in ever whether you know to not get payment out an over there to help it and they'll come over and so uh but listen don't call him text and he's like me he didn't answer the phone people call\nIn two thousand Eighteen dot com we're going to make the office independent and about people not politics he's smart he doesn't try to make them feel single [laughter] bow Joe twenty I think we appreciate your coming on air and thank you too thank you for having me [noise]\n\nMaster control so this is W.

deal there\nAnd use the verdict coming in just moments ago after Andrew Brunson found guilty of the charges that the U.S calls baseless but he was sentenced to two times served and travel restrictions on him are lifted that means they can leave the country it's a victory for the administration which has press the Turkish government\nHail two year old male friends who runs them is now over as you said he was sentenced to terrorism charges but he has also been released we've just spoken although it's hard for me the lawyer who said he will be heading back\nTo the u._s. so he was facing a number of charges terror relate to the end espionage all connected to the like I think to a and twenty Fifteen or you think of anyone who knows when they say those are ridiculous he was a picture of the Christian Community ever had\nA gentleman and yet somehow he was caught up in this waiver wrap that took place and then uh people in the U.S in the Christian Community every five as relief never says President Trump\nCame to office he was may ... runs in case he it was one of his uh one of his major campaign promise that say hey we are today\nWe heard from inside the cost and we've had that\nUh the travel ban has been lifted on pop the Bronx in the house arrest and the control which means he is free to go the trial itself today was quite quick it took about four hours they had a few witnesses and then ... it was given the chance to speak he didn't he said just a few ah saying I Am innocent I have to be found innocent and I love hockey and that was the end but\nThat's really was a political case and we imagine that this was decided famous they've ... last night there were reports of a deal which had been down between the U.S talking this is done in a much higher levels and in the courthouse behind me keep for some time has been struggling terribly financially and they'd be on a serious threat to sanctions if they did not release have they won't ... lifted on steel and aluminum\nWell it appears that they have caved a major victory as you were saying for President Trump he faced a thirty five years in jail if he was found guilty of all charges and so suddenly for him this is a great day suffering from\nThis uh this is a big deal um\nOur memory when they were negotiating this and it's kind of saying that this may be a little bit better than we think is going to be and I'm shooting up by um I think that this was a a major a plus for the administration and going to be eager to watch\nHow the um the media is going to play tonight and say how they'll do this or is that predicted they did what I thought they were going to do and they're kind of wish thing opening for NBC network good nightly news and the second is continuing to\nHas been tweeting away since that side at that decision came down I pointed out first working very hard on pastor and Brian than\nJust a minute ago he treated my thoughts and prayers are with pastor Brunson and we hope to have him safely back home saying what we know about when he may actually step foot on American soil\nI'm afraid we have very few details about that we spoke to yesterday and he was a domestic but he didn't want to be killed domestic I'm too hopeful so he refused to make any comments on that we expect it to happen very soon we know the negotiations have been going on for some time in fact they say that a few months ago a bronze in storage trial\nThey had reached an understanding an agreement and that was even a jet waiting to take them home or on the eleventh hour something's been apart since he was then take them back into custody which is why I don't want to get ahead of himself but we ... we knew then\nThat that was a plane waiting to take and whether or not that the than case now we just don't know but\nCertainly we expect him to leave the country very soon but again the negotiations between the U.S is going to say I'd have been going on a long time vice president Pence it'd be very clear about this a long time made it a real cause of his as well so this is a great day for the administration is well\nAgain boxers Gray Davis administration in really is and we were talking about there's several months ago and I thought at that point it was quite a complete that they had already gotten a deal done I think it's interesting that this was happening when turkey is doing the Saudi\nConstantly do yes\nThat's an interesting that's kind of coming together\nAnd this is what I mean there's a lot of jockeying going on that I don't think is being explicitly said in public I mean for the ... going to be really run in the middle east and a key ... who runs the middle east as who has the favor of United States of America\nUm I think it's interesting the game's going on here there's been why would turkey called Saudi Arabia so quickly and then came so quickly to these demands with the U.S must continue and it\nJust reached the highest levels of the administration I mean the the um administration the Trump Administration imposed tariffs on a Turkish aluminum and steel imports to the United states as a result of the Bronx and in in um imprisonment\nAlso slapped some are financial or the sanctions on its interior minister and justice minister uh this guy to the the highest levels of the Turkish government and they set up\nThat is right on top of that one of the main things that are ... and the other one president on ones that was the release of cruel and he's a cleric who lives in the U.S who he believes is behind\nThe coup um the administration being very\nClear that that was never going to happen but suddenly negotiations going on for some time in a very high level and in fact the president on one woman told himself into a corner at various points because he made it a nationalistic issue over here and he said we will never bow to the to the so the wheels of the u._s. um the judicial\nAfrican Americans since one word as amazing as it was

but in the ... it's in fact this is true but he was a abducted and killed at the direction of the Saudi Government it will destroy the relationship as we know what\nI've been the biggest a defender of Saudi Arabia in a big champion of the relationship I've been there many times usually listener McCain or the crown prince has talked about reforming the country in a way that it is pleasing inappropriate but\nIt's he and others were involved in this\nThat would be a sense to me to our values it would be contempt for the U.S Saudi relationship with a\nWith destroyed in my eyes and I would do everything that could punish a the Saudi regime if they didn't that killed there's an ... boys that would be a complete disrespect devout relationship in our nature others understood who we are as

win one of the things he was coming you know but I'm\nI'm not sure how he handles says I'm not sure how he walks has been tight rope here this continuum\nIdle hill are talking about the possibility of cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of arms sales to the Saudis would go that far the president doesn't seem to think that's a good idea\nWell he may be right but I don't know I feel a used and abused quite frankly uh personally I started with the Saudis that him and then the nine eleven actions here I've tried to help the government\nOf it in a strategic ally they help us with terrorism um they've been standing up to ... toward Israel but\nIt must be taken for granted that thing that a guy like me and my colleagues would accept this and just go back to business as usual as completely as understanding who we are or policy has a proponent\nOf our of our values and our human rights or that use and we don't believe in ordinary people because they're they're they're sit down\nAnd are yet to do business with unsavory characters that does business but when you have an ally you gotta let them in the world know who you are and so from that point of view everything is on the table and if the crown prince was an all but with this and then ...\nIt would be impossible for him to be a legitimate leader on the international stage\nHey I'm Lindsey Graham has it become a new

interesting story I'm Sorry for the sexual content or\nThe New York city police department says it is looking into allegations that a detective improperly coached a witness during the Harvey Weinstein investigation will see evidence claimed Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him in two thousand and four but new information revealed yesterday cast doubt on Evan story\nAnd response prosecutors abandoned part of the sexual assault case against one thing CBS this morning Saturday co host Michel Miller sat down with Evans attorney for an interview\nEvans was among the first woman to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein and sexual assault in the New Yorker last fall and may she became one of three women to form the foundation of the criminal case against him\nBut in a stunning reversal now five months later Evans attorney says the district attorney has abandoned her client\nNow I I'm\nLucy Evans attorney Carrie Goldberg says she has no doubt that when Evans was an aspiring actress in two thousand for wind steam forced her to perform oral sex on him and his Manhattan office\nHe's been steadfast for the last Fifteen Years that she was forcibly sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein there is no writing in existence that refused that\nA letter to the defense unsealed on Thursday Manhattan prosecutor's disclose it a friend of Evans told in NYPD active in February but Evans agreed to perform oral sex on wind scene in exchange for the promise of an acting job\nThe letter says the NYPD detective responded to the friends claimed by telling her that she had no obligation to cooperate the detective denies the allegations but acknowledges he failed to inform the district attorney's office of important details of the interview\nSo little technical glitch here [noise] this is one of the first accusers to\nNow shown Hannity some interesting stone listening to talk about the subject that I'm always monitoring and this was gonna be ... meadows um and talking

and Jim Jordan and engage sitting in his in all of them I should mention a few names because there's so many of them and I want to give every one of these are tough\nSmart guys they know there was no collusion it turned out with Russia there was coverage and but it was with Hillary Clinton but at the end of the ... Republican\nRecovering go folk heroes because these are great great people and they want to get to the bottom of it\nCongressman we now know Rod Rosenstein\nLet's see he recommended firing called me he signed the last ... weren't the third renewal application\nAnd this is a guy that appointed Mueller that we have three people say that he seriously was talking about wearing a wire to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment McCain said it was actually for the cage said at least ... Senate um let me think of the other ones um\nYeah I I tell you that the reporters that you have on on with the two great reporters that have done\nTremendous working on this front but I think probably the biggest part is is the president is exactly right there is no collusion he knows it\nI Know even the Democrats know it and it's about time that Bob Mueller him much finish the investigation it's time to call it quits because what we're starting to find out or the wheels are coming off\nGlenn Simpson fusion GPS going Simpson refused to come before Congress I talked to the chairman Gowdy this evening a the only option\nAnd that happening and we're the thrill to is that the president was going to release where where are the Pfizer warrants that he was going to release\nWhen we've got we've got to get those out a transparency is good medicine shot as you know I'd been advocating for that the president has been advocating but he wants to be cautious and I applaud that you know he's getting a changed left in ride of interfering in this investigation in yet another fearing\nTheir obstructing congressional investigations that sure constitutional role which to your credit you were doing\nSo this was on the Rosenstein going before the committee which have said no and scenes of Donald Trump's okay with it but also getting requested they've had no way you concluded\nThat Rosenstein doesn't want to do that because he doesn't want something on paper\nThat is going to basically get back to somebody knowing actually what they're doing I really believe they've got a major investigations going on the J investigation post among other things but some became a grand jury\nWhich I Believe we're in for this I think Rosenstein is actually going to I think he's gone before the uh\nThe grand jury committee\nCirrhosis of the second part of this and he's going to uh be asking a search a quarter about this and she's going to dump on Rosenstein and just sessions\nSarah Carter I couldn't agree more with the shine on this I mean look\nWe have Rod Rosenstein a obviously a lot of information has come out in the last few weeks we know that James Baker the former general counsel at the FBI\nCame forward and said look we took seriously what he said he wanted to invoke the twenty that we now know wearing a wire mean whether that's right and risk secretly recorded the president of the United states that we also know that there were two other people apparently speaking with Rod Rosenstein\nI end the president credit for that John the president is a great chess player I think he's making his move now I think that the president came out he's been talking a Rod Rosenstein we don't know what happened on that flight we don't know exactly what they spoke about during those thirty minute but the president is looking and watching this and\nI absolutely believe that there were other people inside this administration now that we're with Rod Rosenstein on this and I think it's going to come out\nI don't think it can come out next week but I think eventually the president will make that public if he's smart and then you'll get rid of Rod Rosenstein he'll get rid of Jeff Sessions he'll put other people in place this is what I'm hearing behind the scenes they will happen\nSo she's kind of hard on and they're kind of hard we will see in the fullness of time and so now is going to go to a John Solomon and they're all going to make some productions\nHere I thought was interesting Alisa pay John Solomon says for nine months they had no evidence of Russia collusion and just sort of just before the appointment a raw were Rod Rosenstein Muller and then of course even Peter Struck says there's no they're they're\nNow I think we're with their median league strategy that we've um we've been able to bill and rightward\nAlong with the insurance policy comment\nThey link the information to different news ... about it all goes back to the Clinton phony Russian ... say\nThey lead all over the place to create an atmosphere that oh that must be so much happening this really happen when just the opposite is true the only Russian interference came from Hillary pay for Russian wise that would disseminate into the American people and uses of fraud on Pfizer Warren Court four times\nListen there was a lot of Harry Houdini going on in May of twenty Seventeen at the Justice Department they knew they didn't have a case and said that\nAnd it was being instructed by the president or and I think when we look back in history we're going to see a lot I I was taking saying because of the work of Congress are met over Congress in Jordan those have been digging we now know two years ago this month\nGlenn Simpson and Christopher Steele route peddling their story to the um\nMedia trying to get it out before the election currently showing their political covers\nTwo years later Glenn Simpson can't even come any more than ... testified to Congress because you have to invoke has a right against self ... nation how far has this investigative journalism point collusion on Russia to collusion with the Democratic party in the FBI and it's because of people like

we've heard some on the left to say that they should change the Senate rules I mean they really this is an over for them and they think that's a great winning strategy for that election\nI definitely don't think it's a great winning strategy for them I think that the more that they engage in these behaviors and the more they're trying to push the envelope of justice ridiculous and it's the more it's turning people off and it's actually I've even seen an uptick in my campaign of people who are walking away because they're so frustrated with\nThis never ending circus that goes on and on I mean you're talking about changing Senate rules this this smacks to me of when we were talking about\nChanging the electoral college after the two thousand sixteen election I mean like\nYou can't just do this you can't Everytime you don't get your way you can just change the way government works you know I mean is it would be much more effective strategy for them to actually change their policies or just started like engaging an honest straightforward behavior rather than be like we didn't get our way so let's just change government\nAnd we've also heard a cause for more investigation and we

Ohio man it's just like okay whatever got but\nOne part of its political like how dare you try to bring people together our how dare you like try to speak for the black community with your uh what did Michael Eric Dyson call it a some sort of bullets Craig\nOf\nIgnorance or something like that a ... a blitzkrieg blather ring ignorance is what he called Kanye speech\nAnd so there is a political aspect but it gets ... ... if you look under the hood of health democracy works and this goes to my other story of the day which are the headline is and no avail knew this but er an omen doesn't lactate\nThank you right now you know it's been a big debate in the country but the same people who have to tell the envy bop went all means do not lactate so the top of the aisle almond is not that Pete no no it is now now wait a minute or something like a tiny out at\nThe same people that feel it necessary to say that to the American people are you may know or the same people that are like oh my God if Khan yeah he's in the oval office hugging Trump that means some of these em\nI'm Still still you know when he pulled a Rodman right is it actually it is it true that people will vote for Donald Trump or like Donald Trump because Kanye was there yeah it is true onto a sheet man really you know some people people know don't you bring up people\nWear already\nWhat if your\nFather\nTo him sneaking drunk one night to the barn\nAnd you know you were ... you were conceived my love to an almond and I had to drink milk from an even know it really it it makes me my dad's ... if if that's how this game is going to work and I think is what scares the hell out of people I is it is becoming more and more just a popularity contest\nAnd I think you make a very very valid point there because I Do think that's what scares them is when you\nPopular in pop culture ... says hey you know this guy he ain't have bad\nThat's what they depend on\nThe the uninformed voter yeah they they depend on what your wife say they're not like you and I said they don't listen to news talk they watch the TV and they're like oh Trump's mainland wrong must be pretty good normally a popularity contest it's the it's the ...\nIn ... before was like building up to the election\nThe people that are paying attention and weeding out the other people you know ... they kind of make it so it's not just a popularity contest when my my position being clear here on the ignorance and voting ignorance isn't on just one side oh hey well oh my goodness ignorance is just being relied on by what the hell no\nThey're all hell lot ignorant people and if you're offended you're probably not the ignorant on\n... on his blissfully happy\nYeah I'm ... I'm bogus argument of her and I don't care who the is I'm voting for Republican\nVote for that orange guy over there mhm he was on a TV show says it out is man I got an hour by nine years also the thing it's this isn't a put down the there was really no incentive to be an informed voter I'm at this point before I can sit up here in fact I have\nFor hours every day for seven years when the news every morning we'd be on the news\nTeach myself maybe badly but try to teach myself economics more political theory what's going on in the world in terms of geo pull up politics all sorts of things health care policy education policy forming an agricultural policy\nAt the list goes on and on try to inform myself so I can talk about it somewhat intelligently on the air and I can do this and try to influence opinion but at the end of the day you're always vote counts the same amount as the person who goes voting for Hillary in the same name as my cat\nOr a woman or or she's ... the Democrat what's the incentive to be informed if at the end of the day your vote counts as much as the most ... person out there though\nAnd they and they do and then there that idiot that is voting for ... for the cat matters because you didn't do it 'cause he likes current I guess my point is that a certain point in this game of recalled democracy this big popularity contest it's not about how much knowledge you have\nThat's a force it has never been about who's the most the informed and lighting public making the best possible decisions don't though and of course the people in D.C don't think that\nThey don't treat situations like what apple Kanye like that and they treat it like there are a bunch of people out there are limiting there's probably a better word following the the leader they treated like the American people are stupid they treat you like cattle wet and you've got to move you in the past year\nI think that's the one thing that Donald J Trump tapped into was he went past all that and he talked to the individual person and it was it was I mean it was people like me the blue collar worker\nThat well maybe not like me I Do ... but you know the the quiet people and they were like yes I like that now I don't care that you did that I'm not listening to all these\nThe personal attacks against you we know you turn to a million dollars into ... billion dollars you know how to run a company you use\nAll the little side swipe so well he said well when you're rich and famous women lead to grab 'em in their right to the site yeah they're ... ... yeah that's a man that was a shocking revelation everybody knows that and and people overlook ... exist\nGroupies ran around\nYou know and and people were like yeah let me comment on merit\nBut let's let's moaning of us are let me make this even or personal in the sense that\nI Know I haven't been in a view of opinions on politics all sorts of stuff but if somebody really push you on like how many of your opinion said just in politics and like with Donald Trump wants to do really pushed you argue as certain like I'm an expert I Know for a fact\nI Am right there might be a few things because you've worked in those areas in life\nAnd you've really come to a point of I think this is the right way to do it but I'd imagine if somebody pressed you said gun to your head are you actually certain you're right about everything\nProbably back off now I Know\nThat's that's the attraction to Donald Trump is he never would\nBut never back off a nobody said I've got an open mind\nYeah it well he wouldn't say he said he would say some ... little thing that would make them go around I think there's a difference and having an open mind and backing off a book that night\nI didn't say ... you know what I'm saying like what's the best possible way to deal with the issue of immigration\nOnce the best possible way to have trade what's the best possible way to regulate\nA an economy monetary policy social policy whether or not marijuana should be legal or illegal at the federal level rescheduled in a particular way maybe we should look at how the criminal justice system works at the federal level should we poured and some people are getting commutation of Senate says what county was talking about to the president\nThere's all there's just so much is my point yeah that does not get talked about in the news so much\nThat it deems day even somebody who really smart and who dedicate their lives to be informed on a particular issue is going to be ignorant about all sorts of other issues because there's not enough time in the day there's not enough room in the brain can't know everything\nI Would I Would hope that I Would be open to discussion I mean there's there's a few things that would be no don't even talk to me about\nThis ... ... just like with the immigration yes maybe you could do something different that and build a wall\n... maybe I Want to me though will I mean to the common you have to you have to appeal to the lowest common denominator\nBuild a wall you know it is going right it is and it's clear when guys you can visualize a wall yes and people are not coming in that's why you don't have jobs people are coming in and taking your job where there's a truth or not does not matter but per se is reality before when you visualize\nThe wall it was like a crappy six foot fence of kind of broken you know and now you think of a wall and you're thinking like Jurassic Park right in Canton Sommer\n... also always paying Floyd when I heard the wall oh on ... and the law is a brilliant branding thing but here's also the point is like it doesn't matter whether or not the wall was wise policy it really does not\nDo you think most people decided to vote for unlike I've really taken the time on every single policy of my party to decide whether or not this is why do people vote all the time based on got based on emotion based on a single issue yes based on that guys\nWell
