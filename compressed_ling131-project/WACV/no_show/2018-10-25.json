Philippines ... or or or South America somewhere somebody were trapped in this case is and and and Stormy Daniels kinda got knocked out of the spotlight so to speak oh well you know and right now\nI don't think there's any real big story right now but I expect on any minute that it's going to take everybody's mind off what's going on well I'm an old\nOne what's that we are in contact with someone who says they know where Elvis really is\nWell you know that's been that's been a conspiracy since uh August of a Nineteen Seventy seven because a lot of people say that the king did not pass away that day\nSo what we're going to do is we're going to make a challenge and they they have accepted it that we will\nElvis personally come to our next client appreciation and reveal where he has been all along\nI don't think he's been hiding out of ... you don't a lot of people say that but I just they just too many people go through that every day yeah so and you know you might be on his way back from the kitchen or something\nLike ... you mean [laughter]\nSo we're going we're going we're going to challenge this person to bring you this or Elvis to bring them\nAnd we I suspect they'll come in here with a stretch limo or something and they all have their uh you know their party with him a there are protections are uh what do you call those guys are probably Jay's bodyguard bodyguard mafia will ... will be will and we'll see we'll\nThat could be what we need to make sure that gets video but what\nWe need we need everybody out there they want to see if Elvis really rarely rarely rarely exist fail around to contact us let us know that you want to see Elvis show will appear\nAt one of our studio snap on Facebook or you have to do is go in and uh put in that search bar up there are put in a health and well with David artist\nAnd it'll take you to a ... page you can comment or do that and then share it for us yeah shale other people can see it 'cause we won't Elvis Cohn yeah\nWe want we really want him to come if he's really out there and if you're really out there and we\nAnd you're listening to us we are is we're setting up this adventure for you so much you can come and we promise they won't be any government spies were not inviting any government spies here to to to this is only our radio but he's already old friends come\nAnd they they they go on to protect you in other words we're going to make sure you All right and you can tell ... well you know especially\nAfter right after ... that it was la la conspiracy uh going around that you know that uh he was not dead a matter of fact a tenure\nTucker who used to be older than me but now she's younger than I Am I figure to actually do that yet but she said that she went through the line and she looked into the cascades so that was not held isn't there is probably just a fake so you know it it and if anybody can pull it off I think it will be Elvis\nBut you know the thing is Elvis let them have\nA lot of his money of course he got it all back another way and that's what you want to do was Elvis let the government thinks they got something okay yeah and that's what you want to do you want to let them think they got something but then you want to pull the switch ruin them legally and he did he pulled us withdrew his family now was worth over half\nA billion dollars will be\nWhen they when they when they sold you know Graceland and and so they came out real well but he gave the government lacked a or his his estate give the government like three point something million dollars it was worth about seven point something million and then he ... he wrote it down to like three point five million fear\nWhat we've seen Lee Harvey Oswald was behind\nHim right when he when he shoot and they rise that gives you argue that second shooter on the grass you know actually I think there was somebody in the sewer right there was supposedly some guy down in the Internet or under I Am in stone dry and he he shoots ah up and from the I don't\nMean to sound like a sound like Kevin I'm Kevin Costner he was shooting up and from the left open from Melvin from the left Iraq and they are actually no rational you head umbrella man yeah umbrella man that was strange yeah you know if you if you look it up on YouTube ad about the time\nThe motorcade passes the right guy standing there\nAnd he opens an umbrella right it just out of the blue jays opens up the ... yeah and then there's the ...\nAnd this lady with this a scarf tied around her head ... and she is in just about every scene of this thing and they they never did find her right right it's just wild and you remember that a big time wrestler that or was a governor of Minnesota\nJessie the body venture into her yeah he's a he's a big conspiracy yeah well you know ... yeah he took a a similar raffle\n... uh that uh supposedly you know ... ... he said he said he was a expert marksmen he said there was no way he could got that that ... those shuts off whenever there's no way you got this old Italian rival that might or might not far\nRight and you got to get all three shots in in like two seconds and I I think I think one shot actually missed his and hit the uh supposedly hit the pavement\nRight and uh because they saw you know were British shape and then uh\nThe the the to the ... I Believe both of those shots that were they were actually from the front ... ... and uh you know they even had a a idea that the guy driving the car ... shot him and I was like how do you do that [laughter] right but uh let's see the governor of Texas was there\nYeah kind of like a comic was not a calmly was wounded right he was the best that magic bullet to John everybody yeah that was that when they drive often they are in turn and come back around and\nYou know magic bullet I don't know if we got to have that technology then I don't think I got it now you know when you're looking for a magic bullet you're looking for an excuse exactly one of them I was trying to cover up something that logically didn't make any sense\nSo they come up with a magic bullet of all thing and the bullet that they actually\nA recovered a bullet\nThe hospital it fell out of it fell out of the ah the already called re stretcher just fell out it was laying there and it's got a mark on him into the you hit something with a bullet is it's going well what's the what's or not they form but uh it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna it's changed ... ... it's going to me you know\nThese doctors MDs how many people out there think they'd MDs or ... idiots and don't know what they're doing my own anything and they've got bad memories I personally think that most of them have pretty good memories and pretty intelligent people\nThey said there was a balloon on the front of his head and they said ...\nAhead go when when a physician that is fairly intelligent looks at one end says ... what I had one mhm came from the front no doubt and all of a sudden it's ...\nBillion not think something does get covered up our we fools or we stupid well I think people think we are evidently every day in and I don't know if you remember but the F. B. I\nTook the body to Washington the the folks in Texas wanted to do the autopsy ... and they said no and they said well it's our jurisdiction they said\nWe don't care were taken in Washington if you don't like it will ... will five children\nAnd they took it to why they took the body to wash ... you know and it\nIt just when you go back and you do all if if if this was a murder trial that was going on right now with all the evidence and circumstantial evidence that we have ... they would have probably have put LBJ and a bunch of other people in jail ... not\nLet them become president\nI mean it's ... there's just there's so much stuff in there uh there's a lot of people that think that\nThe CIA the FBI along with you know the the oil people mhm a lot of folks say well what was glad that they won't ... why don't they won't tell you have ...\nWe really boils down to money my friend that he boils down to money you know what was going on during that time that was a big escalation that was about to\nBe de escalated boil it was a Vietnam\n... is that right yes and JFK said I Am bringing this war to a halt I'm going to stop this war well they had plantation trees out their rubber trees that were out there\nAnd I I had this lady that I used to work with and she said at us she said one time she said as I said to her I you know I don't really know what the Vietnam War was over she said are you kidding me\nI said ... what was it over the domino theory she said\nNo food that domino to\nKnow that it's just something they put in books and make things sound good about she said it was over the rubber tree and money and the war\nShe said my daddy was high up in the south Vietnam army he like I don't know what he was but he was way up like you know close to being a general in charge she said he told her that's what the war was over everybody knew that it was over the\nNatural resources of the rubber trait\nSame reason while these other wars around you but you know you got Iraq is oil\nAfghanistan has minerals Miami's more minerals and Afghanistan than any place up probably on earth of in China\nGuys were not completely stupid we know there's you don't you can have conspiracy theories but you can have reasoning there's reasoning and ... you don't have wars for just to have a war over a domino that bat fall over they don't do that\nThat's that doesn't even make sense and JFK was killed for a reason he was a dangerous man for a reason I really believe that they killed him to get rid of\nHim yeah and uh Bobby wouldn't far behind it not mind few years later yeah but it looked like he uh he might have a\nStep into the White House into the oval office and then he was go\nWell they they knew that he knew probably who had killed his brother and he was dangerous mhm because supposedly he did ask LBJ why did you kill my brother\nYou can go read that its own you to file same thing same question was asked from a JFK's widow or she asked why did you kill my eyes but I mean one of the ...\nThink they need to happen you know yeah and some people say well that was just a conspiracy well maybe it was a conspiracy that they ask those questions because you can't hear them asking those questions but it was mentioned that they ask them okay and and there's a law you can you can read into some of these uh ... look at look at JFK is\nJune he's gone oh yeah I mean do you really think that there's this black cloud that falls around trying to kill everybody in the family will look at it to look at it this way and\nI think there is something that has a kept them out of the White House ... or so with the with teddy I think they just let him alone so he would self destruct\nHe'd already had he not already you know some done probably happen quick or that we're starting to hear him for ah being in you know in the president's ah ... but you do what he said don't you\nKnow he told his family supposedly the he he he withdrew from being president remember who from running bright and he in supposedly the ... the word was out that the reason why withdrew his because\nHe this family begged him to ... begged him to do that because they didn't want to lose him to ...\nYeah so\nI Believe that probably is true it could be could be so the thing is do you trust the government\nKnew you trust them to really really really really do everything on the up and up and they're always there just because they want to protect you\nI Am wary are do you think that possibly they are in it for the ... on a think anything the government gets involved in is for the money there are entities and the government that do things for\nYour your health right on the line [laughter]\nYou got mail no doubt not in my opinion they doing it for something else now that they might be a good soul in the area that has a good intentions but I Do believe that [laughter]\nSometimes something might change well I I heard something the other day and I think it was Nancy Pelosi that said it so it suspect just about that that fact right there right but she said\nThat the reason there were not term limits ... is that people had to get up there and stay up there a long time and get to know people and and be able to to learn all this stuff and then step in and be the big leaders and then she mentioned um\nShelby shale but now he is a six years old and he's been there for a while right they say he's just now getting to the point where he can he had these committees I'm like you know that's kind of flowing the system right there\nBut it's to our advantage right now I hate to say I really has to I yeah I mean I don't know you know I'm not going to say anything bad or good about Shelby he's a politician ... I I could say bad things I can say good things\nHis answer to me was that votes have consequences and you will be held accountable and November it wasn't I'm Sorry it was an hour to realize the parallels it was like I'm going to aren't you even more\nIn spite of what I've just gone through a and people in Pennsylvania and I just you know just cannot believe even his friends\nAnd understand what would cause him to do something to be so heartless evil\nSo you're saying that he Greenland this commercial and he and and twenty four hours he they wrote a commercial that news or or had an example I'm an anecdote that used your story or that it was already in the pipeline they should've taken it down\nIt was a running yet said whether they already had they had it in the pipeline of what they were going I I've I've just found it pretty ironically\nNow it's tasteless\nOr was he was a commercial that had twins with cancer you know something you think about doing when you're doing a commercial and the fact that he were added after he knew what happened and and and wouldn't take it down he he only will take it down in Scranton\nUh because his own friends and family chance than seeing a but yet it's still running as we speak today he's he continues to run this\nIs about ... disgraceful [noise] excuse me on but I think like the very least he should have\nJust taken a taking the thing down if he didn't know if it if it was some wild coincidence you should have just taken a down a little bit I think for you [noise] for you the best thing to do at this point is to run on the issues and issues are facing the country today\nAre are of course this immigration crushed at the border which affects every aspect of our lives from economic to national security and health and\nAnd uh all other concerns a sovereignty and so forth and what do you believe should be done with these ah\nHordes of border busters\nUp they would have listened to me back in two thousand six maybe ... you know we wouldn't have had this problem you know I I I've been a standing up against illegal immigration this is an invasion there's no other way\nThere's no other way to put it and it's people like Senator Bob casey who supported a support catch and release a that is really just encouraging people and and you know for all these years of\nOf the week politicians in Washington who who want to talk about a pathway to citizenship basically giving a green light to people all over the world come to America once you get here\nThis is why Donald Trump was elected president because they

central cities\nI it's just beyond me that uh that we have people who are in elective office decrying our laws\nWell a little the state of pets Pennsylvania they've thought and twenty sixteen was going to be a you know the Waterloo for Donald Trump ended up winning a and yet some of those numbers have\nA very least softened for the president and Pennsylvania what what's happening there that would that would cause an erosion in Republican support is it is in is a demographic changes due to immigration is that trade what is it\nYou know it's nothing it's set these experts pollsters

out of Pennsylvania ... around his own and he was down ... points they're wrong they're not getting the right in Pennsylvania that they don't understand people here in Pennsylvania and many of them for Democrats because their fathers and grandfathers were Democrats\nAnd they were JFK Democrats and this Democratic Party\nRepresents nothing there people here in Pennsylvania or can can associate

they were going to vote for Republican but they did and the and\nDonald Trump is not just appointed people here in Pennsylvania one and the pollsters are wrong they have our race stronger than ever be

time we believe that they were um ah reserved or by a friend of of Adam's Mike Miller and when I got there after work I got my ticket we went and saw a assume my brother or pay for it and so far as I Know that was the deal Iran the venue the\nFor him and\nHe said that I meet the press or was it at the debate\nActually it was during a live stream that he was doing from Florida where he was like us explaining to his followers what was it yesterday ... story was blowing up and this is how he addressed it yesterday about what's what is\nThe real truth they align your hurting my he mentioned Mike ... he thought Mike Miller reserve the seats and his brother got them and paid for the Mike Miller is the FBI agent posing as a real estate developer whom he had a text message we now learn from a lobbyist friend who said\nMike Miller and the crew had tickets for us for Hamilton tonight at eight PM awesome news Gillum responded now he's trying to shape and shape the story to make it seem as if oh I thought he only reserve the tickets and my brother paid for them and just handed them to me well that this story is starting to slip and slide\nAll over the place the critical race for Donald Trump this is probably of all the races across the country it's the most important\nOr the governorship of the great state of Florida because of its effect on the twenty twenty campaign and of course that Florida is a bellwether state\nFor where the rest of the country's going but CNN is even heading at the FBI probes centers on whether developers successfully influence city project at one point in the program undercover agent successfully infiltrated Gillum inner circle\nNo one's been charged with any wrongdoing and killings repeatedly said he's not the focus of the investigation but as attendance at a Broadway show with lobbyists and longtime friend Adam Corey along with his brother and a federal agent\nWho went by the name Mike Miller has been used by political opponents I suggest Gillum is potentially under more direct scrutiny you want to elect somebody who could very well be ... down the road indicted by the federal government given this given this story\nThis is getting worse he he could be under even even more criminal trouble let's chicken first with chip Roy is an interesting piece in Politico meet the next Ted Cruz in November chip is likely to be elected to Congress top House Republicans worry\nThat he'll be to the rights of the Freedom Caucus that's music to my ears a chip of courses are running in the text is uh twenty first congressional district against Democrat Joseph Kopser\nHe's a former chief of staff to cruise and he joins us now chip without would check in your uh your up in the polls but you never want to get too confident uh how are

mid ... people who are frustrated with the status quo in Washington how completely insane Senate Democrats aren't they know that if you want to go\n... committee cloud show a loss on\nA low you see this a situation in Texas where moral Latino and we and Raymond ... found this out when he went to the Trump rally or this week are a special correspondent there\nAnd there are so many Latino voters Latino American legal immigrants into the United states has said what are we doing this is just ridiculous they're all for Trump to offer crews and obviously they're not going to be voting for you are a lot of them are going to be voting for you why do they want to turn this country and to the countries they left\nWell there's no of course that are really tell you that the strongest advocates that I meet on the campaign trail that I talk to you dropped this district in all the taxes\nThe strongest advocates for border security are those immigrants who come here whether there is not particularly in Spanish and taxes are coming here legally they know what they got you know determine ... separate\nFrom places like Mexico and Central America and there beside themselves to see what the Democratic Party in particular and frankly some Republican she works as\nA supplement to their their beside themselves what they want to do to this country and so it looked the message of border security I'm strong immigration and standing up for our country is selling well and by the way who would I Know\nIt is much better for immigrants that we have a secure border I'm tired of watching this girl was good and sold in a psychiatric industry riding on the top at train car bombs dying it does because we were keep your basic sovereign ...\nA ship ah who we know you're going to do really well ah and we know that uh he will be a force\nFor law and order less government a smart fiscal policy day regulatory effort to we need to deregulate and we can never let Texas ever let Texas go blue\nBecause Texas just like Florida I'm Talking about this Andrew Gillum isn't here isn't here and then he had a story to tell chip ah but you know we were both states are critical I mean all states are important but the the left has taken over California and we see what the result cannot let this happen cannot let this happen on Texas or Florida\nThat's absolutely right as Texas goes so goes who goes America you're absolutely right in Florida is much better state and they really\nNeed to get that election rock writing I'm quite sure hope will they will but also a say this I Can't thank you\nFor having Christian Clark is on the show the other night a on a on Fox and for being a champion for that family a one on one whole family who obviously lost a crust allows her nephew I'm already Vargas lost her son Jared ... in June they live in a round my just ... minutes while working art of ever happen\nThere that's a great family and a thank you for highlighting Betty and just as there are still up and willing to work too so that they want justice for America does this mean strong border security and the rule of law being reestablished on a ...\nAnd they said the ... family told us that you were really the the one politician who came out and really gave them support they heard nothing\nUh from the Castro brothers zippo from them including walking Castro who's a congressman from that district her nothing from so chip thank you so much I Know you're going to do fantastically well and we can't wait to interview when you become the next Congress men from the twenty first district of Texas so

special and watches sunspots vanish and your bags and puffing is diminished and for fast result the Gen you sell immediate effects is also you're afraid they'll get ... dot com now\nI'd gone just great Laura thank you so much for having me and yeah we have closed the gap in the polls\nThat when you're speaking out was done by our our Minneapolis Star Tribune which we sometimes called the red star a and that one had the damage it fixed and then the one before that it had a Democrat or happy down three so it is going really well we are getting throughout the state and meeting agreed and\nHad a big debate the other night uh are only state wide televised debate and my opponent I chose not to show up the only Democrat who didn't show up for the debate well\nHow how would that even possible I mean the Democrats have\nMade some fairly significant headway in in\nA both the Senate seat since Norm Coleman and a sense a you know we've lost the governorship plenty and then he tried to run again and he he got a defeated obviously I'm In his bid for the Senate ah but where where are we now and trying to\nAnd trying to rebuild the Republican Party in that statement is\n[noise] uh era of just two years we've seen a massive ah uptick in the states productivity this is all positive why would people want to vote against that now\n[noise] or they don't ah we had a or Minnesota is turning Red Cross the whole state people are feeling it they're happy with the way the economy is going and I think Tina Smith didn't show up to the debate the other night because she didn't have any answers to this and where she stands on the issue she's do are\nLeft and so a dream and and part of the resistance and obstructing everything good that is happening on the ground [noise] uh and then she's also\nA for open borders and she wants Minnesota to be a sanctuary state and she is directly tied to Keith Ellison still continuing to campaign with him\nYet uh being as hypocritical as as they are she's a gun you know wanting to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh justice Kavanaugh uncalled for another investigation though Minnesotans are\nAre some of the most well educated people when they go to the polls we don't have to register Democrat or Republican were free to move without the cabin when we go vote and they do their research and and uh we have some of the ... we have the highest turn out\nIn the country when it comes to voting and so we go educated so it was really disappointing that Tina Smith did want to debate knee or at least tell the people of Minnesota where she stands on things because she knows that's not what's resonating on the ground\nWell a Speaker Ryan Paul Ryan was in Minnesota uh yesterday and warned or the day before he said was warning of a\nGreen wave of democratic fund raising in a visit to drum up support for uh some of the house candidates mount eerie Paulson and Jason Lewis\nAnd there are there are two of the more vulnerable in our house candidates um but and Ryan says is enormous amount of Democrat money flooding the state of\nLast week Gabby Giffords came and did a a star turn there for some of the Democratic congressional candidates a and they they believe that if they can fully turn Minnesota blue then that will be another blockade for a Trump and twenty twenty\n[noise] and and it's not happening I'm not feeling it anywhere even in the primary what happened here so we go to our it happened we could have told you what was going to happen um\nMinnesota is definitely turning red we flipped their state house in two thousand and fourteen to Republican our state Senate in two thousand and sixteen oh we've got up on the iron range which has voted Democrat for more than sixteen years\nIs now going to flip Republican we've got a great candidate up there and he's plus Fifteen ... all of the rural areas are farmers are really on board with what the president is doing finally somebody is fighting for\nOur farmers and putting their issues at the forefront of a campaign so\nIt's all it's all the the uh of fake media and their rhetoric and talking about the ... I'm not feeling it anyway and that's just me not just me as a candidate I really am not when I'm traveling throughout the state there's a lot of energy behind the president and and even when he came for the two rallies he's already done to rally\nThis cycle here in Minnesota there's a lot of excitement for my campaign and for the the rest of the candidates throughout the state\nOur current housley it is a fantastic to have you on a ... everybody needs to get out there and vote because the woman who was appointed Tina Smith a is even worse than Al Franken if you can believe that\nAnd the gym you know she uh obviously you know banks that she'll be able to just snuck or the Minnesotan voters for more liberal policies and open borders forget it\nPoliticians in the state uh and uh uh senators representing the state who believe that they need more regulations on the small business owners and more problems for the medical device manufacturers who have done such a great job\nTo ... to reinvigorate the Minnesota economy after the uh the great recession so can't current house has got to win the seat\nThat would be phenomenal news as we march or even after this election toward twenty twenty I think Donald Trump can win twenty twenty and twenty twenty Minnesota and he didn't win it last time around but he made a ... valley and attempt at the very end to try to pull out a victory a\nCar and thank you so much best of luck in that race or for that Senate seat that was vacated by um the group or Al Franken All right we'll take a break eight five five forty Laura we have a lot more to get to a this\nAndrew Gillum Rhonda Santa's debate tonight is going to be critical of by the way oh by the way there's a story I forgot to I was going to mention to current Mexican man admits faking his own kidnapping in Saint Paul Minnesota to gain a visa\nAuthorities say a Mexican immigrant in the United states illegally was bound with duct tape and less near Randolph avenue and as part of his own kidnapping roost in front of fraudulently obtain a visa\nDesigned to help crime victims oh I've heard of all you want to let them into the country at this point because it's such a clever little router creativity yeah I mean could need\n...

right now here's or at least set the scene as of June two thousand Eighteen according to the Federal Reserve\nIn America the consumer debt was three point eight seven trillion dollars oh that's a lot of debt or to the point that some Americans responded to a survey from my bank tracker\nAnd it's a small percentage but when you look at the total amount of Americans is going to blow your mind and here are the basic freedoms here me when I say those folks basic freedoms that these people were willing to forgo if their debt would be wiped clean aren't ready hiking here we go\n[noise] two point four percent of Americans that's about six million Americans\nIt don't they present it was like the like million so that they in six million ... million Americans said\nThey would be willing to give up their freedom of speech if you took their [laughter]\nWe have a live\nStudio audience in the lobby of a financial piece plaza Ramsey solutions Roy headquarters there shaking their head that early ... yeah there's a guy out there with the Georgia had on I Know how you\nFeel he knew I get it okay freedom of speech meaning you can't say what you want that for you know ... like the like beyond for your breath okay\nHere's the deal Joe lunch pail will take away your debt you're sixty thousand dollars in that the differences you can never express an opinion the rest of your life\nHe we we would be ... what would happen\nTo ask Ken that got put on [laughter]\nI Know what would happen to me I think you would on pain easily come bust [laughter] like I I Would go to jail for that you might like it immediately not be able to ... apparently they're not very opinionated\nPeople know what that's absurd ready for this this is this takes the cake three point five million Americans right to cruise would go to jail they would give up all freedom not just speech they would\nPut all along they would put on the orange jumpsuit and go to tell you they know it does it's not that detailed doesn't matter how ludicrous are we talking\nStyle you know go to Ralph around jail they would go to gym all the way from your family you know not have the freedom right now for ... for a family work and pay off debts you're just using that you're just like he was all freedom you're ... food yeah\nNow let's toast break this down for a minute we're having fun with this [laughter] but but I I I Want you to

I don't want to sacrifice going out on an as sacrifice you sports I don't want to sacrifice my rent a couch I don't want to sacrifice my effort to fifty it's costing me seven hundred bucks a month\nA I don't want to sacrifice that\nTo get out of debt Dave Ramsey is baby steps and so all play it I Want to go to jail I'll go to jail\nBefore that ... or ... or it's three point five million dollars who have not heard of the babies that that that bond they just truly have locked all hope that they will never\nOut of it you just hit the point they've lost out so they think I'll go to jail and then when I get out of jail I don't have any doubt\nAbout that because they may I I Want to believe in my the glass as half full copy that there is one and glass is half full cup that's not right you know when I have full\nGet asked George ... opinion what do you think about that in the lobby he's like this he literally put his hands up and looked at this guy\nThat three point five million Americans says an optimistic but that they just don't know that they can sacrifice life out you can make different choices you can live on a budget you can take out an extra job for a short period of time and pay off that that is but the sad thing is that they I've read like that they just thought that they don't think you're exactly right\nNow I don't mind doesn't say I would rather not I'd rather not give up cable and go to jail because in jail did have cable in jail [noise] no I don't think so I mean I Know\nI think is limited and it's like murder she wrote from Thirty years ago so here's the fourth Dave Ramsey has a plan so we're having fun with this crazy that but the reality is if you're joining the show today and you feel that loss of hope you feel that desperate\nThat your basic freedoms you give up your basic for you know we've\nGot a plan is called dais baby steps total money make over walks you through it joined the show the conversation on a daily basis take inspiration from the men and women better showcased every day on the show do that every scream\nWell and on this show and the rights of Christian we always have a couple of come in and share their story and when I left in its edits ... you're listening to you\nIt's it's everyday average Americans that's where it is people don't make crazy in ... they don't have like a super being Cape like no these are everyday people accusing something different ... and at that you have to choose something different for a different outcome and so that's that's the power in it but again anyone out there you can do\n... AAA eight to five five two to five is the phone numbers that is how it gets started take the step today triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Eric who's on the line and Kansas City Eric how can we help\n[laughter] how's it going good how are you sir\nGood um so I have two options I'm a registered nurse and I'm not going to grad school either nurse practitioner school or see aren't a school [laughter] we owe a hundred K. on her house or debt free otherwise um we have a four month old and we're looking at having a second baby in the next year\nI'm In the school I could cash flow and worked full time through high school would be a little bit longer it about a five year program in totality a which is prerequisites and and I could not work two to three years and the dead of that would be Ninety thousand dollars at the end of it\nAnd so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a journeys make instead of the one Seventy five\nWhich do you really want if all those money things weren't an issue and you had the responsibility of a wife and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you can snap your fingers\n[noise] [laughter] it's hard for me to personally answer just because there's advantages and disadvantages to [noise] um I don't think I Would take away the are in a more right okay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nOkay so the question becomes a can you take that next step uh what do you call it the ...\nIs that right yeah nurse practitioner okay ill okay in ... and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nWithout going back to that tree or program enjoy fame prerequisites\nLight but my point is let's say you're in ... for five to seven years and you've got a no debt you may even pay your house off in that time and so your cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder how old are you twenty nine yeah I just\nWonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the into the situation you're going to cash from all that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to cash for your way through that ultimate role\n\nOn really know what are you making now the\nSo you'd have a forty grand bump basically a year with that and how much does that school costs\nThe forty K. uh-huh\nTotal and the other one is nine thousand correct you could do it just are bumper salary honestly and go and you know forty can invest that but you're going to make forty came back in a year the Atkins right if you do that I Know ... that\nAnd then go back to school yeah you may not be able to do than the other school right now like you said that you know the cash for it so no don't go into to the London for that but go ahead and go through the school get an upgraded job upgrade basically and you enjoy other warning offense that's an increase in income at least and yeah and then move into the school and a few years and ...\nYou know that ... I just want you to have that idea in your head I think well you pause you're sitting there trying to run the numbers and I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder to that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what eight years now you're thirty seven [noise]\nYou can cash flow your way so I think it's both saying that's what I say because both of them are what you want to do also for something good folks more of your calls about your life your career your money here on the day ran to show don't go anywhere\n\n\nAre you one of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize but when you raised a family and I have a lot of emotion tied to your home it can be tough to separate the facts from the feelings and that's where an experts advise comes in handy Anna\nIn Portland, Oregon knew she needed a real estate agents help when she decided to sell I had lived in my own for twenty five years and it was overwhelming to think where to begin your E. L. P. helped me determine everything that needed to be done and was patient and put things into perspective with is help we had twenty kids in three days\nAnd I think you bring up a good point racial Chris at twenty eight I think you do need to look at the differences even if they're somewhat nuanced somewhat specific between the coach\nAnd the plan or because I think you can be a financial planner and make that money a lot faster and it's still a coach mean Dave says all the time\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that's that's one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to know that he's got the heart of a teacher well that's a ... so I Do think you've got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nAnd at twenty eight you have plenty of time to get there but in the meantime while you're pursuing the plan I Can't say this enough\nYou're not being dishonest you're not being a shy stir in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and I think you're going to be fine I just would not let that way on you [noise]\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five is the number Ken Coleman Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour let's go to Kimberly who's on the line and nodding home Pennsylvania Kimberley how can we help\n[noise] I I Am fifty five years old I had been teaching in public school and the health care for 'em Thirty years\nOn and I just found in the last few years that on\nTime for me to look for something else in the back of last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it\nUm yeah I can collect my retirement um if I retire with a little bit of a penalty on plans opposed to going all thirty five years and my only on\nFive challenge or block is convincing like hunger and that's a good idea\nBecause it would be a bit of a defined here but\nThey're not twenty five thousand dollars in salary but I Know that I can make that um I I really get excited thinking on helping people find Hong ... and early and um I find that really interesting okay not what I Love my teaching them but it's just kind of course\nI get it I got good news good news for you and your husband okay\n[laughter] so for you to become a realtor a successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time\nAnd I think the fact that you just reveal to us and our audience that you still enjoy teaching there is no big hurry you're not calling in a completely burned out and so I Would not take the penalty either I how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role\nOf teacher before you retire without penalty\nCar five years\nI just want to throw scenario but what if over the next five years you've built your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends\nI think that's extremely doable anybody that's ever been successful in real real estate and those are going to build a pipeline your husband's only real concern sounds to me Rachel is that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five thousand dollars that's a that's a scary thing certainly your age\nWhat if you kept the teacher salary for maybe three years still take a little bit of penalty but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business\nOver five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into retirement full benefits and by that time you should have easily replaced if not maybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what your mate\nSo while still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I'd want you to consider Rachel\nBob and if they had a great situation to be an because real estate usually agents show how this when people aren't working so that means it is night than it is we can't let the ... the busiest time and so\nThat they hey I'm going to commit for maybe when junior husband can decide that a year two years three years old can even go to five years if you can whenever it isn't that we're in commit that amount of time and if you start to see yourself like well I'm really good at it 'cause you sound very enthusiastic about it you sound like a people person which means you're gonna be a great residents in Asia because most people do great when they\nHave great people ... sounds like you can really so even though you're enthusiastic you still may not be great at it you can kind of get some things on your belt while you're learning for again a year or two\nMaybe three years whatever you and your husband decide\nAh and then kind of step into it yeah I wouldn't go cold turkey by any means but I think that this could be excellent because having a great run an agent here and that only thing about it is it still commission base that you get to decide what you make basically like how much you work how many how you sell super fun versus going from where you where the salary of the teacher\nTo do something like that can be very incredible for you personally and you may find that you're really good at it and maybe in a year

I'm just not sure where to go [laughter] [noise]\nOkay and um so uh what do you make\nRight now I Am not working I recently moved back with family\nSo you're separated okay and family is in Los Angeles okay and um do you have children\nSo I'm I'm guessing based on that separation that the divorce has going ahead or not it will be okay right well whether\nYou agree on filing for bankruptcy or not is irrelevant um he decides what he's going to do when you decide what you're going to do if you're not married\nAnd even if you are married technically because you don't file bankruptcy as a married couple um in other words when I finally I could have filed insurance not filed except the sheets on some of the papers or she got the file to [noise] but um and we had to follow him all the different corporations they'll also use that we had at the time that was Thirty years ago\nUm so uh in this case he could file and you not file\nThat's possible whose whose name is the student loan in mind okay so that doesn't affect him anymore that you're eastern one either way whose name or the credit cards in\nBaltimore evenly are all our you're both on all of them were both on all of them were he to file and you not file you would be left last man standing and get to pay them\nOkay okay that's how that would work whose name was the car in Baltimore who's got the car\nThey're two different cars and we're both on him and he has one and I have here\nSo it's so twenty five is cars and waste the breakdown of the twenty five\nTan around ...\n\nOkay the rule on I an asset that\n... that has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset\nOkay so you could you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt double it's not going away you got your student loan back that's done okay the cars then you\nCannot keep the car unless you keep the debt\nYou can ... from the debt\nOkay if I had on me but the only way you keep the car and so sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of the debt and that and like sort of the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they lean on the car\nOkay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or was a I'm\nA ... or in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard so which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the ten Fifteen okay and what does that car worse do you have an idea\n[noise] I'd say about ten okay All right\nAnd so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan that you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he files and you don't you've got that [noise] and then you got the other car now in the event of a divorced what I Would demand is\nThat if he's going to keep a car that he refinancing and get your name off of it\nOr if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car the he's driving is it worth at least what's vote on it\nAnd say about that\nOkay so you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess as what it is and you already knew that okay see so the scenarios are\nThat I'm a you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\nUm I'm In a veterinarian and so I Would say about Thirteen an hour and working full time\nAre you a D. V. D. M. O. now they're an attack your\nAttack okay\nAll right and so I'm In that's in the Los Angeles area or are you going to ask them where else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going to clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the card that if he walks on all of it\nOkay now if he chooses not to file and fight through it than the two of you got to work through this together and you're going to be\n[noise] what does he make\nAh last year he made about ah twenty five\nOkay it coming out of the military\nNo scale and he's here in the military\n[laughter] yeah there was no security clearance you understand that he understands that I'm sure you file bankruptcy or security clearance has gone\nSo I mean his chances are moving up in the military are are are harmed pretty dramatically if he falls or bankruptcy but he doesn't make any money ... and and he just came home of a deployment and he's lost his mind that sounds like\nOh my goodness yeah [laughter] I'm so sorry I didn't care\nAnd I just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to be how old is he\nGoing to heaven yeah yeah okay\nIf you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine um\nI I think if he files and you don't you've got to force him\nA to sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to sell your ... to ... I'm In and get you get you a five thousand dollar loan for the difference and then you work your way out of the credit card debt the little bit of a car loan driving a beat her and the student loan debt is going to take you a little while with your income\nBut you can do that it doesn't mean you have to file just because he files mathematically or legally\nOccur as as as making sense to you here so I'm Sorry your face and all is what a mess listen if you get in the middle of and you're going to the question you call me back I'll help you okay thank you very much and thank you Chris is with us

I just\nI wanted to get your cake and the you know something personally in baby steps here you know where my wife and I talked about it were a little more comfortable you know when we have a fully funded emergency farmed right now I don't know we're just trying to navigate that and I wanted to get your take\nOn the uh we do endorse a Christian healthcare ministries Islam or ah sponsors for the live events and for some other things over the years I'm full disclosure I have a group health care plan at our company here as Blue Cross Blue Shield that is my personal healthcare\nSo and I'm real careful on the show is you know or even through financial ... not recommend people to do something I don't do that kind of a thing but I'm In a little different situation I've got a decent program a available who may um and so a Christian healthcare ministries hum the the\nYou know the bottom line was the thing is it's technically not insurance as you know it is all sharing and it is based on the book of acts we're Christians band together and share each other's burdens or innocence becomes cooperatives day on his what it's doing 'em and uh the the\nYou know I Would never suggest going into something like that that did not have a long or even the possibility of going into something like that that did not have a long track record and these guys have thirty forty years of having never missed a single claim\nNow you have to read and you should read very carefully to what it covers and what it does not cover\nAnd know that and they've got a couple of plans you can buy the upgrade plan that covers different things and that kind of a thing family plan their singles plan all that they've got a normal you know an array of products so to speak to learn what's covered in what is not covered\nAnd they clean out insurance you're technically if someone else in the program chose not to share\nThen war would you be you know technically but they've never failed to make a claim\nSo it's worked for forty years you know I mean whatever number of years but decades right so I'm comfortable with its credibility in that regard it is different than insurance and we get our brains get dolled into how health insurance works and this has got some nuances some differences to it so learn what those are\nNumber one number to know that I don't personally do it even though I Do believe in at number three the only way I Do it as if they had a long long long track record which these guys do and it is a Christian\nHealth care ministries and so uh and and the ... that their definition of that is is that if you use tobacco or ... or alcohol then you don't qualify\nAnd so they're already hard core in that regard um\nAnd so you need to you know be aware that that's there and that's a limiting factor as well and they ... you know they want you to affirm your face as part of the process you're Christian fight\nAs a part of the process and so that's where it's for and how it's laid out but all of that and once you know all those nuances and you know those differences and you can see them um we would not have endorsed that if we didn't think it had credibility\nRight and that ... and and I guess if I could ask when fall apart and we were to go through that being in baby steps to you and all that kind of up one of the things that my life with a little concerned about\nOne of the ones we're looking into that has been a long term track record and and we're OK recall the requirement for you know we're we're evangelical Christians and all that out of step and we're normally pretty healthy [laughter] it seems like it'd be good for our family\nBut like one of 'em you know you pay out of pocket kind of like when he could have ... and stuff so if you're a baby got here would you recommend it when they go that route\nTo set aside that they had a dollar to insulate you a gun\nOr a you've got to remember the guy that you've already got a thousand and baby sit around and so you're close enough of that and if you run up over just budget your other five hundred into your budget flow\nYou know you might have to slow down your debt snowball a little bit and baby step to to cover some bills if you had an event right right or it's just like carrying large the duck the boys use it in and they just say or something I'm but I'm going to take that part of the risk gone for sure\nAnd I'm so forth but but yeah Christian healthcare ministries is the one that we endorse hey man thanks for the call April's weather's April's in New York City Hi April how are you\nA ... day

and these changes and specific changes in the king James Bible and I said no I have not and she sent this video\nAnd I thought to myself you know I'm busy I don't have time for this just sounded so ridiculous to me and I was ready to just delete that video and move on I was annoyed\nAnd [noise] I\nI felt that God just stopped me right in my tracks and just sit and watch this and I watched the video and I said okay I'm going to prove this wrong right now I have for King James Bible one is in my travel bag that's Twenty years old it goes everywhere that I go over the country and another one\nIs a hundred and fifty seven years old and it is in the top of my closet in my office and I pulled them all out or late I'm On my desk\nAnd the first thing on the video said that Isaiah eleven six have been changed now Isaiah eleven six is one of the most popular scriptures in the Bible it statues are made of it paintings uh phones Elvis sang about it\nI it is the scripture that says and the lion she'll lay down with the lamb you remember that\nGeorge Bush did I Do are classic\nFor anyone out there right now if you're listening in and if you think what I'm about to say is talk of a madman turn or go on line the king James Bible dot com or Bible Gateway whatever it is and and punch up Isaiah eleven six and now it says\nThe real road\nRules for it no longer says the lion she'll lay down with the lamb it says the ...\n... it's in writing it since the ... never heard of that\nUh George when I saw that and I saw that in my Bible I nearly fell off of my chair I spent three years in Syria biblical studies\nI Know the scriptures and when I saw that I'm telling you right now I couldn't reconcile that I just couldn't believe what I was seeing and there it is\nAnd again don't take my word for it if if you're out there listening I get a hold of a King James Bible or punch it up on line and you'll see it for yourself\nYeah we'll we'll let's say the wolves\nAbsolutely and I've taken pictures of it and it's there [noise] that is ... ... ... it is bizarre George it's I have no ax the only explanation and I still don't understand it and I have it in the in the new book the only\nThing that I can take over this\nPerhaps this is linked to CERN which is the large\nHadron Collider and the Swiss French a board out in the work they're doing I Believe they're opening up portals she dimensional doorways I mean I I remember\nAs a kid the lion lays down with the lamb\nYeah than if you can get town here somebody to a jump for you and show you on screen what I'm saying and you'll see for yourself and you it's shocking it's really shocking to see it because anybody\nWho is heard that scripture you know it by heart it's one of the most popular scriptures in the entire Bible and now it says all\nCan you find it anywhere where it says the lion lease down with the lamb or is it just isn't the wolf all over the place\nIs the wolf in every Bible now however\nA friend of mine uh he has a YouTube channel ah um his name is Chris and I thank you very much for finding this for me he actually found him and his YouTube channel is become one that could see\nHe actually found something for me out of an old encyclopedia biblical encyclopedia and he found the passage with the lion and that is the only place\nThat you will see it as something and it will be in my new book stranger than fiction and that's it everything else George says little wall\nI Wonder if it's going to change if he doesn't look at it every day for example if one day it's going to change to the wool some\nOh it wouldn't surprise me one bit and furthermore the Lord's Prayer is now changed what happened to\nOf the Lord's Prayer is our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name came come that it will be done on earth as it is going to have and give us a standard to forgive us for Trump after\nAs we forgive those who trust pounds against us but leaders nodded the temptation to deliver some evil for that came into power and the glory forever more right you've heard that are making\nA horse or way it's changed now for now to our father which are in ... and I never heard it like that yeah how come I Will be done in our\nIn our new we're we're as in earth now he'll live in or the is there some\nThing that changes these things\nAnd I do believe without really knowing the answer and even if I saw it in front of my face I don't know I wouldn't know what I was looking at\nAh but I Do believe that it is CERN and these the way of quantum computers that are working in concert and I think that it's earned it opens up the portal and see the way computers\nSomehow some way whether it is some way as crazy as all of this sounds I assure you it's true that they have this ability to go back whether it's going back in time and changing this\nI don't know but I can assure you of this for anyone out there who would say oh\nThis is just the Bible that are you know they don't make these changes coming off the printing presses and all that I'm Sorry I'm Talking about a hundred and fifty seven year old Bible then has changes in at a Bible that fit in my possession for years that has changes in it now so that can't be\nStanding we can't resolve that and another thing that I find very interesting\nIs that the Lord's Prayer I have it on paper and a frame on my wall that was changed to what I just told you ah but yeah\nI have Lord's Prayer carved in a stone in my own and that is not changed and it has not been changed so it's interesting to note\nThat what ever this technology is apparently it cannot make changes\nOn something that is in stone or of some type of metallic substance or something like that another bizarre thing George\nAh do you have any Roman numeral clocks in your home or do you have a watch with Roman numerals\nI think I Do I think I have a couple of watches what that\nOkay well I Want you to look at the F a Roman numeral turned upside down to\nOne is what has happened to them\nThis effect has now turned them opposite so they're upside down now for where you would see a in the five o'clock position you know that would look like a a V. that's now turned upside down\nTo where it looks like in a that's weird and again\nFor anyone who thinks that this is crazy talk just look at your ... your clocks and and and another ... and I've taken photographs of this as well and people from all over the world are another thing there\nAnd and other interesting thing I have some watches with Roman numerals that have been affected and changed yet I have a clock a Roman numeral clock on my wall it might\nThat have like metal pen for the Roman numerals and that had not been changed\nYou know we're going to have our ins to pull back on our website as we get some new software and I'll be able to pull people instantly bill and I would love to pull people on the lie and lays down with the lamb and see how many people say that they agree that's when it was\nAnd then compare it to the statistics uh yeah I've been in so overwhelming people would say that it is that it was a little lion lays down with the lamb\nNo question about it I mean the wolf is ridiculous it doesn't fit there's no way when you say that it just it makes no sense odd\nGeorge when you look at it it just looks so odd it's not right now let me ask you this\nThat the e bay you're familiar with the da ya\nGetting for Smith administrators\nWell it's interesting that you say that because it was known as the drug enforcement agency that's why they were DEA agents and now it is the drug Enforcement Administration\nWow why Bob see I've always thought of it is that we're going to come back with more built in a moment on coast to coast am your phone calls with

Effect and your calls as well bill would this fall under the Mandela Effect category of the actor jak collapse\nPeople thought he had died he's dead now but during his day when he was very much alive everybody thought he was dead everybody you talk to his would that be part of the Mandela Effect\nI tell you that George I would\nVenture to say yes I mean it's not just jak Lance uh the Reverend Billy Graham ah Nelson Mandela at the other you know what the name came from Jim Neighbors and various other um stars like this or politicians or that or or you know people that are\nWherever and I'm from how we all had it wrong and bought these people at the guy ... years ago and you know a lot of\nFolks that died in more recent years here and\nThere are people who swear they remember funerals for Billy Graham and el ... specials and things of that nature\nReally interesting\nThat I could say is that the the apple\nIs a master\nOf confusion and division so where there is confusion there is division because if I say to you well George and I think it used to say this or whatever and you go now now now it's always said this now we have confusion and division is going to come in and I really believe that\nThe source of this is demonic in nature and this is a ... I Can't take this in my opinion is part of the strong delusion and the great perception that has come on the earth I've had debates\nWith Bible scholars on other shows about this topic and they swear that none of the scriptures have been changed they've always said the wolves fan all these other things and I'm an agent for the devil for saying this and it it's mind boggling George\nAnd anybody that knows me and you know me well enough got his first in my life I Am an agent for God I'd go all over this country helping people to be free from demonic garbage but yeah\nThere were people uh in debates against me on things like this they just said no way you know you're twisting the scriptures around and nothing could be further from the truth\nWhat did they say the devils greatest trick is Rob making people convinced that he doesn't exist\nYes absolutely and it's uh I'll tell you that this is where we really have to and and I am poor people out there here what I'm saying are now is the time\nTo really close to God and ask God for discernment to know what is right and what is wrong with his true it is not who is true who is not\nBecause we are in an age of deception and it is only by the power of God and the guidance of God and the protection of God that we're going to get through the things that are here and the things that are coming\nHere it's actually kind of scary that so many people the great majority believes in one thing and then there it is clearly in black and white something else and we swear up and down that they can be\nYeah it's incredible it's mind boggling it truly is and\nPeople are free to believe what they want it's not my job to try and towards somebody's arm into believing something but it is my job by the power of God\nAs a man of God to speak truth and when something like this comes along I can remain silent on it because I feel I have an obligation to people\nThat tell the truth and as disturbing as this is I'm Sorry it's the truth and people need to get ready and prepared for this\nLet's start with the phones ... truck driving in Indiana they're going to start an age oh go ahead\nGeorge very good thank you\nThis made it back stuff is very ... you know the guy I remember it is still alive in the lab myself uh I don't know it's\nKind of hold him ...\nBut that's the thing is I think it's an act in the actual\nLike cereal world not just like we would be quotes there's a famous movie line so hard to change the way remember some song line and like shrimp here\nIs like that but like there's a there's a tree over close to my house there the other like the family\nOr any names and people who live there ... there and all of a sudden there's this fact kidding [laughter]\nIs there so I just wanted a pop up there are\nAlready thinking would that be part of a Mandela Effect where everybody doesn't even recognize the tree and it's there\nTo words there are people that are reporting stuff like that that they're seeing a you know things that were never there before they're they are seeing I'll give you another example for breeze you know that that the air freshener for breeze\nYes how'd you spell that\nI'm a I'm just guessing but it's I Would have said F.

article for manufacture which is attracting a great deal of attention called the which board president Cleveland kindly wrote back and said\nI knowledge was saying the which board which you sent me as a wedding present I accepted as an evidence of kind feeling and friendship and can a moderate fourth ingenuity but hardly think that I needed to be tested powers to disclose the path and forecast the future\nTo take it or knew he was he took it he took it I Would at least censored back\nWell there's no there's no history that now we don't know where that board is the left just tell you what happened fast forward a few years for four years and they use now Eighteen Ninety and a group of businessmen and one businesswoman got together and came up with their own board version of it and they got it named\nAnd talk about this woman here her name as ms Helen Peters not for the and they consider her a gift big psychic and she said at the board and the message came through and it said they asked what should we call you wish we call this tool to for this device it's spelled out we just\nThey they decided let's go we just so ... so they needed to get it patented so in Eighteen Ninety they went to the U.S patent and trademark office allies rub on the attorney for this group went along with miss Helen Peters they sat down at the board because they had to prove\nTo the Patton officers that this tool works everybody kept saying no I'm not going to do this no I'm not going to register is not this this is ridiculous finally the head guy came out and said okay you don't know me I don't know you if that thing there can spell out my name\nIs George what do you think happened it's filled out his name sure enough and the ... came alive\nNo didn't spell out his name with somebody on the plane ship or you probably would have been accused him of doing something or did it work by itself you\nKnow you got to have your hands on the plan show after that\nYeah you have to so it started out they didn't know him and it was you know that's how the story goes so this woman miss Helen Peters not for the uh is really critical in crucial to the naming of the board\nAnd also to get in a patented and a lot of people didn't know about her till about six years ago when Robert merge the chairman of the board of the talking ... dug up an old archives\nStories and letters about her and so it it's just we were honoring her just last month in in uh Denver, Colorado and gave her beautiful gravestone with everybody everybody's and that was hard earned buried in her plot their names are on it\nUm she was just on her she was just lost to history but we resurrected her and her family was so grateful and thankful and and now she's going to be well no and she's going to go on the heritage and a group of people who do tours in his grave yard\nIs called the Fairmont cemetery in Denver, Colorado and she's going to be remembered and and recognized for her contribution to this device forever\nHow do you explain to somebody called on the show a couple of years ago and talked about how to get rid of ...\nBurn it and he said as he was burning it he could see little sparks come read off it and screams he heard screams coming out of the board you believe up\nWell okay so I have the story is right and again I'm gonna I'm gonna references again we all have our stories based on our perceptions belief\nOn how you view the world her own fears our own desires and so I don't mind is a powerful thing it can create many things that we have and truly measure and understand and we don't fully understand awareness or consciousness\nAnd how we might even a factor wants to create in our manifest yet I'm going to say that the story but what I Will comment on some board don't burn very well because they might be made out of ... and I and the worst thing to do is really burn a board I mean you could sell that on ... hey fed to us\nAt the ... society will take them and we'll refurbishing and selling it given to a loving home that really wants to protect us the history and heritage of these devices\nTearing what's the oldest board you've ever come across\nWell for me my own for the circuit Eighteen Ninety to Ninety three board so I got 'em raft they've started being made in Nineteen Ninety One in production minds when you're after that\nStory how do you explain this back in St Louis when I'm doing my night talk show must be Nineteen Ninety seven Ninety Ninety eight\nSomebody gets me a we gee board I've got it in my studio and I'm going to do a little bit with it and I've got a producer there\nAnd this we gee board is in the studio with me\nThat I never had any technical issues with in the studio all of a sudden everything is going wrong by commercials I couldn't play him because the computer board went though the board that monitors middle my voice levels that was all screwed up the lights were going out I didn't know what was on and what was off\nIt was weird and I finally told my producer Howard at the time I said I Would get this thing on the year he took it out and within two minutes everything pop back up working on the computer the board everything and I want this is weird\nAnyways what I didn't know at the time was Howard ... widow news guy named Daryl than hot word game Darryl\nLuigi board he said it doesn't Georgia doesn't want this you try to get him so he took it as a gift I didn't know that\nAnd um you know I did my show over there and work and that was fine uh about two days later Darryl is no longer employed at the radio station which was kind of strange what he's gone then I Want boy that's weird uh\nAgain not knowing that he had the ... board\nI I run into him about a week and a half later\nIs at a restaurant and I wonder how I Am sorry I heard you're not one of those in the morning when George nothing has gone right with me ever since Howard gave me that ... board I got fired I lost my relationship I Can't get a job\nI got rid of the thing and hopefully things will get better how do you explain that carry\nWell it's always all too easy to point the finger at something out there then to look at yourself you know maybe the filing down any way on a path of not doing very well working there or maybe he wanted\nWell what about the studio thing with me in the beginning\nWell you know do you want to blame it leave I buy something that you want to make them if there is they don't want to look at something logically first it was ironic that it'd\nBarry I Want to go but I have to give you that do it but I got to say we we we ... the the the poor because it's so controversial and it just causes all kinds of meetings and and visceral reactions in people we really got to look at um what's really going on inside herself and what's really going\nThe board did it but that happens too often 'cause it's almost easier like end is to blame for the external and to think that's the reason now now hold on us another way to think about this too we create a lot of things we could just have the thought in her mind that ... is scary danger is bad and then we can draw those things to us\nJust for the power of our mind this one power of unconscious mind and then spin around and go I told you the it's like self fulfilling prophecy\nI don't know why don't you know all these years of going you Karen you haven't been able to convince me yet to use the region board\nI Know and that happens sometimes\nI mean could you be wrong could you be wrong\nAnd there's something very wrong about what aspect of it but it can conjure up evil spirits let's say I'll say this you can ... anything evil\nIn your mind because I think evil exist in the heart of humanity I hate to say that evil and then people those evil all over the world look around it's people cause evil\nBut what I say is evil is not a force outside yet we can draw these energies to us withdraw other evil people too as we can have evil things happens and they are real bad evil things but I mean just because you get a piece of wood out or cardboard or there's numbers on a piece of paper or letters that\nThat's going to cause any problems so I I I for my world my life and what I've experienced with this tool and away from the tool I'm convinced that you cannot\nNow but having said that people have their own beliefs and their own beliefs will still become a self fulfilling prophecy if that they truly truly choose to find\nI mean do you recommend kids play with this as a board game\nI recommend it if a child wants to use it the best thing to do is to not go don't do that because they're going to want to do the snake ... better thing to do is say hey what is it about the ... why would you want to use it what are you what do you think about it what do you like about what do you want to know about\nI Want to go to come through that they want they you know what they want kids like the stuff\nOf course some adults do too I mean look ups popular these shows are and colonel investigations and I think the best thing to do is say well what if it goes came through what's that going to do for you how's your life going to be and how the conversation\nI don't know where that conversation is going to go and it may go where you decide to for example I live in southern Cal you may decide to go take a child out of the queen Mary

... dodge calm and it's linked up for you don't have to worry about spelling that it's we've got the link for your coast to coast am dot com\nAs well Karen you mentioned that the using the board is somewhat like a permission explained that\nWell we have the ability to interact and reach into the unseen dimensions if someone's became aware where they'll go again I definitely believe in an afterlife with it for life and in between live and so I I came into this world as a very young child things they're having imaginary playmate\nHaving positive experiences with them as well\nAnd I knew there was something so much more and for me the wage war became kind of my lifeline to have a connection that contain throughout my whole life [noise]\nUm so it become is that permission allows me because my allowing become my\nA gateway or becomes just a channel like you do and I actually can do I mean I did this as a child [laughter]\nIt sounds we put that stuff away as we get older and grow up and were told not to do that not to talk to beans that aren't there imaginary playmate and go to school and I was told those things\nAnd so I found myself putting in a way that this is the one tool that worked really well for me to be able to have those communications and to this day I'm I have communications that I used to have the child and I could do it on the board in off before and I know it's not the board that lets me do this\nIt's my self with my ... my beliefs about the ... my allowance\nComes that kind of a door that threshold that lets me moving to his rounds and interact with them\nHow often do you use the board\nNot as much as I used to I'm doing a lot of work George direct channeling I'm with my voice or writing off the board more often than um he's the board but I use the board I Would say about once every two weeks let me twice a month\nI might go as much as an only doing it once a month but I I prefer to work with a partner at part as a very busy is probably schedule himself so when we do get together we'll do\nA session on my last anywhere from three to five five enough hours\nHaving said that I Do a lot of ... a sessions for my YouTube channel where I Will do answer people's questions and let them have readings [laughter] um and I do live shows like that like I'm doing one on Halloween evening as well um so I I I really try to interact with people with the tool and when I'm not using I'm most of the time talking about writing about it or\nAnswer people's questions about it\nWhen you are in trouble with the ... board does anybody free go\nWell yes [laughter] yes they do rewards yeah you\nKnow you can always item um and I do talk my boards I always have a traveling more with me and if I don't have one with their forgot one which has happened all you've got to do is get a piece of paper right the letters down put the numbers down yes and no in a way you go with the coin\nSo the rest of the several hours going to fly by so let's get some calls him for your Karen Angie in Ohio welcome to the program I N G\nI think you taking my call and we want to go straight back when I was a teenager I had a boyfriend that he can do out of body experiences\nAnd his family has really religious and they didn't like the things he was practicing they put him in a home for a while while and see if I had a we keep word\nAnd I had and I actually do he said well if you talk to me I can leave my\nBody and I can come visit you so one night me and my girl her baby brother and sister and after they went so that we decided to try it and it was really calm quiet night it was warm and the windows open the front or a phone you know it was early eighties we really nothing to be afraid of ...\nAnd we're trying to talk to him\nNext thing we know we heard and we're noise and the front door the screen door open and there was no way an open so we jumped up and when he plans a door locked it\nAnd just started shutting all the windows because we were like oh my gosh somebody tried to come in the next day he called me cause for good behavior he was often make calls so he called me and he says\nWell I just shut the door on me so what are you talking about he gives you tried to talk to me last night I came down and shut and we're on me I said that that I get rid of the weeds you overlook\n...\nThat's a I I Love when she shared it what I've learned about the border over the years is that you don't you can talk to people's higher so you can talk to people that are still alive you can talk to animals that are alive or deceased so it's it's what it is it's really too you're communicating with their consciousness communicate with that part of themselves that exist\nLike the higher self that exist beyond their corporate ... existence or experience and so you have these other dimensions of a person so I don't one bit doubt that you can do that I as I have done that myself\nAnd that one didn't have a real bad Andy do it no\nNo and I think she just booked herself because it is kind of weird at first we started doing this and you go wow I thought that person is still alive isn't aboard the use of the deceased person will no I learned that this board can become your cost me the phone I I use it as a cosmic phone like I Would have wireless phone dialing the frequency through my intent\nTap into connect because I've trained myself over

expansion\nGene truck driving in St Louis said Jean go ahead\nA gene George journey to Mike all talk your ear\nWith all due respect I'd like to disagree with you know I just read or you know do you think that was coming out of the board is things that are coming out of you and you really can't buy that because as you're talking about their ... you know the\nPeople who never met this man are able to use the board and the board shoulders man these people have no idea who was really there was a more intelligent being coming through the board and the man before they ever got there and you know

the spirit and they will miss glued you continue to do that\nGo ahead a journalist to react to that thank you\nYeah I think it and I'm so listen when I'm Talking about abilities we all have a six

abilities and\nHow that turns out and human life we often have\nWill have dreams of prophecy will have um thoughts of like something just doesn't feel right here or gosh I've known this person for years it's those things I'm Talking about when I was born people use the word on this level of using a Ford you're able to bring out your own six sensibilities\nSo these people using the tools were able to tap into that\nWeather is they're eating motor using the subconscious mind which includes these abilities of psychic abilities or medium ship for\nUm even just tapping into just your your knowing this\nOr that can cause a spirit now I'll do I'll dressed the second part of that he talked about you were told not to do this often told not to do things that will keep us in control and keep us down and so what I've found is we're told you have to have an intermediary to talk to spirits you mean in a merry intermediary to talk\nTo God and I find that I have a direct connection to all these things which has been nothing about loving and beautiful so with all due respect you and I disagree with you but I think we both can have an opinion because you're going to find George that's

lives and here she is on coast to coast gr is a welcome to the show\nWell how George thank you so much for having me on I Am so grateful and honored to have this opportunity to share my information\nAnd do you consider to be a good which aren't you [laughter]\nWell I I Hope so [laughter]\nAs opposed to ban which I guess but no you're you're you're an upbeat person you're you're friendly you care about people absolutely no how did this all started for you how did you get involved in witchcraft well\nYou know I started working with a ... and she's also happens to be of I I consider her to be a very powerful which and um she introduced me to magic and instead of doing the work for me because you know she I feel like her healing [noise] um\nI I feel like whatever she does with the only just so amazing but instead of doing the work for me she empowered me and and taught me how to do it myself [laughter]\nSo I just you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest is history I feel very very confident with with what I Do you\nKnow with the spells it I've been executing [noise] so that's how I got started it was it was more about healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like I probably don't need a healer because I'm I'm using magic as a form of killing\nHave you ever cast a spell on somebody never\nAnd I want to make that very clear that I Will never ever ever cast a spell to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] not what\n... what what what good are spells that if you can't learn anything\nYou know I think that the power of our minds because I have discovered one thing I have discovered with magic is that in my mind is more powerful\nThan I realized so I think that when we start healing on so many different levels that we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance and spiritual abundance [laughter] so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will conjure up a money spell and work that\nBut right now I've just been focused on doing the um healing and crossing and reversal\nWhen you talk about magic what are you what are we talking about there we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something else are we absolutely\nAnd it can be used by anyone I think people you know use magic every single day with the power of their minds so when I talk about magic\nI'm simply chanting spell and when I work my rituals I chat between anywhere between one and two hours I don't just Trenton said was really on long\nAnd rehearsing for Jimmy in ten seconds yeah chess or get an idea what you're doing\nUm [noise] well when I exercise my house is kind of fun because you have to put on like this magical persona so all the uh negative negative beans leave this house we well we can say what is it I Know I Know it I Know I'm just a little nervous\nGeorge on your nerves for talking to millions of people right\nAbove excited though I'm Still when I exercise my house because I Do do a house ... every single month to keep out the entities in any you know opportunists that happened to be seen by\nAnd I will say I'm negative beans leave this house never to return I cast you out I test you out I test you out so I Will do that while I'm throwing charge salt water and the candle and every single corner of my home and it's really really works and then I'll ward all the windows\nYou know the the feelings and the floors and everything else so um that's fun it's really really fun and then when I when I chance spells like when I Do and crossing rituals which I think everyone should learn how to do and and do it very often\nAnd I know real capable of learning\nAbsolutely I think that we are we have become very lazy\nAnd we are we have either I mean we have given our power away to not only our friends and family but to the government and it you know we were just we don't want to do anything else I feel also that we've\nWe feel very entitled we feel like everything should be given to us and so this is one of the reasons why I'm mixed really grateful that my ... didn't do the work for me\nWhile I go to tell you it is it is indeed magical when it works\nIt really\nAnd I have not only felt result but I have seen results that actually creeps me out [laughter]\nWell I got to tell your career so you ... to ... I have I have a view fight them off or do you do with\n[laughter] yeah I Do I have a story to Maya demons layer well it's it's not as tragic as that but I have had one experience and I I Will share that with you I Would say about Nineteen Twenty years ago and this was my first experience with a real\nLive Damon and men this wasn't like a portal it was in my house and it came out and you know wanted to play it was actually a demon that was summing up by a very evil some federal and he sent it my way let's assume that all of that as soon as somebody out is a religion\nAnd um they need to be good or bad I don't know much about this on the idea of religion but I Do know that there are some powerful ... yes I'm sure it's a religion okay and so they work with magic and they work with the auditions which are different spirit\nI'm so this ... battle had sent a intentionally of course it sent a demon my way and this was after I had had her reading with them a psychic reading and of course I was so naive and I didn't know I didn't know anything about the occult or anything about metaphysics I was just you know whatever just living my life\nAnd I that same evening that same day in

paw\n[laughter] I have one but it was going up and down on my left ear and so it was really really crazy so at that point it was either fight or flight and I obviously couldn't sleep because I was ten down so\nThis wave of courage just came over me and I just thought you know I I I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just thought and as soon as I\nI made that adjustment in my mind I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just peeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm I just hung up and went up and I'm not kidding George\nI felt a hairy leg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone\nBut it just like it flew away obviously\nThat's right where it is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't believe me but

which is actually a wise woman so that's the definition of a wage but yeah I think you [laughter] I'm\nKind of wanted a ... [laughter] they can do it even if\nI tried [laughter] I'm Still one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand\nI'm considering we all lived thousands of lifetimes I'm and I'm Glad I haven't remembered any of them [noise] um some of these lifetime so we were not the best of people and um it's very possible that this is my theory and it could be wrong but\nI have proof from ... who kind of confirmed um my you know my thoughts about this um it's very possible that some of these people these victims or experiencing what is known as karma\nHarassed and molested in this lifetime with the demon the danger with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in this lifetime\nOn the demon the pay is is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of a demon die unless you like\nYour guest them all but they don't work hard exactly\nThere's thousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at Georgia it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demons and what's going to happen when we reach incarnate\nAnd the demon is going to probably harassment molest them now that's one one theory and I can say\nWith confirmation that it's it's it's probably very true because my sharman has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of of people who are being molested harassed and just you know possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a ... journey into their past lives\nAnd nail it and nine times out of ten these people have made packs with demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which and you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just\nBreaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situations and you know these demands are not bothering your neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified sharman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark forces you want to ... what what are they want with us\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity\nDuty we'd also\nAbsolutely and I'm sadly a lot of black magicians will cast spells against people who they feel they can steal light from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and the book into us however they do it\nAnd what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent so this is why it is extremely important especially right now um to\nReally really really really clear ourselves on a daily basis and do vanishing rituals prayers and and ... our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases\nOf of the human intrusions in people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um manipulate our thoughts\nLet's go to the phones for you know camping in Redding, California to get us started our cats go ahead\nGeorge how are you are good thank you I got I'm losing my voice so I can hear me all horse or good okay Hi Curtis Hi um my husband and I both but I think curse school friend oh boy [laughter]\nIt wasn't but a year\nAfter he and I got together but an accident occurred to me and I ended up to him a couple months later [laughter] you know do you think that this person is cause I I mean just fucking out or the vice from her\nAnd I mean she might even have a dog but I told him I said do you think that it's possible that a person could have put a curse on me and he looked at me and said absolutely\nWhile she obviously when they broke up did not go peacefully didn't you\nKnow and actually she helped him move into his apartment and it was like God open the door for me to leave my ex husband before God you know in a permit became available was perfect timing I got in there\nAnd and part right for maintenance Kevin ... vote for him later down the road it was it was totally like doors opening\nInducing Kathy this cursed along you\nYes I Do George I fell down the fight is there room for\nMorning well I was going for morning walks every morning before work well this particular morning\nYou can say goodbye to funky old water heaters the league and leave you standing at a cold shower streamlined checklist water heater with a longer life from deadly blooming Poland today a two week by thirty six sixty seven Gore visit them on line with every woman dogs\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control this is W.

stories of abductions I've ever read it is one of the reasons I got into this business\nBecause when look magazine came out with the interrupted journey or the story of Barney and Benny Hill I mean I was just mesmerized even at a young age\nHow would you categorized that case the Barney and Benny Hill case\nI think it's a very important case and for several reasons I'm\nOn the people are not talking about people who don't have a reputation and we're not talking about people who are trying to seek attention to her attention sake but he was a social worker or respected member of the community\nShe had a mixed marriage with Barney Amos black choose and why that was very unusual nearly sixty\nIt took guts for them to come out that trade and they were very concerned about what the reaction would be a\n... is is in the early sixties and you know it got to ... if you're going to have people who set a new standard of what's going on and got to have people who can handle hate speech\nFor a long time when a Nineteen sixty eight I guess and I'm\nA buddy on when I'm Around a long time for ... for which I Am glad and uh it was a good case to set the ball rolling so to speak on the whole business of abductions and interactions with him not sensational live\nI mean let's face it stand back and say between ... specimens for somebody\nAnd they weren't ... treated but they certainly weren't going on for the glory and claiming all kinds of ... things as being part of their interaction with the ... ah [noise]\nAnd you know I I was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet them early on\nI ... and I I was very impressed and I was impressed by something else or the media\nAnd in that case I mean K and Pittsburgh station in town and uh uh you know I I that's where I made my view and on the air so to speak\nAnd they called me and told me that they were bringing Betty and Barney into town and told me where they were staying\nAnd which is very unusual yeah like contact with them we had dinner together or just the ...\nAnd I had a chance to you know one on one kind of thing and I was very very impressed and I had known what to expect because I hadn't dealt with stuff like this I mean it's a little bit crazy story aliens you grab the couple a an interracial couple\nIn those days you were just getting into this field weren't you well yeah I mean you have you done it pretty early on was early yeah\nAnd the sixties and it's no longer in the sixties or seventies or eighties that's right no\nTill I was very fortunate to have met them one on one so to speak and I saw it in the ... conferences that I didn't get too many meetings with Barney 'cause he died within two years when I first met him a less than that [noise]\nA buddy who has gone on and of course I worked very closely with these nice Kathleen Martin we've done three books together and ah\nAnd that's been a pleasure to have a it's not often you find it can break with people uh I have a co written ... books we would have with other people but we seem to be compatible\nYou you you too clicked and she's ... in the field and you follow due to a ... she's super person you don't gamble when I was that Twenty one year old reporter who interviewed you one of the other interviews I did was with Dr Benjamin Simon who ... who is the psychiatrist who\nWho studied Betty and Barney hill and this is I'll I'll always remember this because he was in Boston I interviewed them over the phone I'm In Detroit\nAnd in a you know I'm I'm obsessed with the story and I asked him I says so what do you think Dr about they're\nTelling you the truth or not what do you think he said I I don't know if the story happened or not but I Will tell you what I Do believe\nThey're they're not lying whatever happened to them both of them on under hypnosis separately to hold the same story and they they believe whatever they saw happen to them and he said\nWhat happened but I can tell you they aren't lying to me and uh what an amazing story\n... we have to remember that the doctor Simon random facility for three thousand shell shocked war veteran yes called the ...\nFor anybody would get involved in stuff like that\nAnd he had learned to use a nose as a means of bringing guys who've had terrible experiences you know your buddy said falling off next in battle a that's traumatic hate beliefs\nAnd so he learned how to handle this and so they were very fortunate and winding up in his hands\nAnd you know I I'm Still not sure exactly what he finally thought about the whole business\nBut he surely thought that these people are not in line that's right they're not looking for attention cetera et cetera\nI was impressed with him and uh I was impressed by being born into a foreign aid the idea is forties and uh uh unfortunately but they they they were they had nothing to gain a mixed couple in the United states in the early sixties ...\nWas not parading itself around the world when they were asked to come out so to speak I resisted put a reporter for the story out much to their surprise the relief well they were treated fine\nUh and they found out around the world and that's the thing that I have a look I lecture to Nineteen countries and it's given me a pretty good handle on one of the people and think about the subject of flying saucers aliens or you know losers from someplace

Mars or something I've talked about a lot on this program is the world's natural gas supply and how it how it interferes in\nDictates what goes on a among nation states we've talked about how it impacted the Syrian civil war five hundred thousand maybe a million dead there hundreds and hundreds of thousands millions displaced all because of a natural gas pipeline a cause the United states trying to stop Russia\nFrom Donald Trump gotten involved a little bit on this um\nKnow how to get Europe a hard time about the um natural gas pipeline\nAnd he basically said if you guys don't knock it off something is not going to give in and we'll look\nTrump's tactics are working Trump's tactics are working Germany just yesterday announcing a key concession to President Trump is how the wall Street Journal reported a key concession to President Trump\nAs he tries to loosen Russia's grip on Europe's largest energy market or Germany is Europe's largest ... energy market as Germany goes so goes Europe Germany is totally in the grips of Russia right now now everybody wants to act like Donald Trump is Russia's puppet ...\nIf that's true why as all Trump's effort being put towards loosening Russia's firm grip over Europe's energy markets\nBecause that's what's going on right now or the wall Street Journal has the story um Merkel told a small group of German lawmakers that the government had made a decision to cope financed the construction of a five hundred Seventy six million dollars in gee that's liquefied natural gas terminal in northern Germany\nOr this terminal this project had been delayed for over a decade why\nBecause the government of Germany to corrupt government of Germany was cutting deals with Russia\nTo keep the pipeline is the only option for German gas\nUm [noise] us media outlets are going to spend this you know they are [noise]\nAnd they're going to show that the that Germany is doing this on their own and all that it's not happening\nBut north streamed to pipeline deal that we've talked about a lot on this program is a big as Joe Biden's had big F ing deal it's a big deal big big deal this is the this is the pipeline this is the company and this is the the the contract that the the consultants all that that the ... the former German head of state\n[noise] was involved in are still involved\nTrump said it was very inappropriate that the u._s. was paying for European defense against Russia well Germany the biggest European economy was supporting gas deals with Russia and guess what Trump was right about that Trump was right about that but nevertheless because Germany so corrupt\nThey were willing to take the kickbacks kickbacks from Russians [noise] and the appointments to Russian gas companies in exchange for being completely and totally relying on Russia so what does NATO\nNATO was essentially keeping Russia at bay from rolling into your that's what NATO was designed to be that's what NATO is to keep Russia out of Europe\nSo we're paying for NATO\n[noise] we're paying for NATO and the United nations frankly but we're paying for NATO to keep Russia out of Europe while Europe cuts deals to exclusively get the L energy from Russia and you see the problem Trump faced year do you see the problem yeah but the United states face\n\nThe north stream to gas pipeline as an eleven billion dollar pipeline that goes seven hundred and fifty nine miles from Russian gas fields to Germany\nIs a massive massive massive pipeline in once Russia gets it and once germ once Germany and then the rest of Europe is completely dependent on Russian gas [noise]\nRussia will be able to do whatever they want to Europe NATO or not if Donald Trump has proven ... putting puppet [laughter] so he has to say that he was put in front of it he would be in on this deal he would not be trying to get Germany\nPut together a gas terminal where American gas could get sold up they should just keep that in mind your

accountability act a law that pays students to transfer out to a failing school there and dozens of schools that are deemed failing in Alabama and some of them are right here in Montgomery the law help students in those schools pay for private school instead\nSome school systems however Oregon complaining now that that takes money away from them ws if a twelve John O'Connor joins mainly\nTheir mark right now if you're a child as a failing public school you can use state money and the form of a scholarship to transfer them to a different public school or to a private school\nThis from the twenty Thirteen Alabama accountability act which was controversial but for the past and has been ever since as political reporter Olivia and us form reports five years in some school boards are asking the legislature to repeal it\nWhen you have a government you know giving you a chance to come out of poverty to be a part of the learning system would you not buy into that\nMontgomery public school board member Lisa Keith is talking about an Alabama law she supports allowing students in a failing school to transfer to a non failing schools or private school with state tax dollars in the form of scholarships but some school board members said the act takes away tax dollars the school needs\nThings are short winning tests but [noise]\nYou know we have a lot as\nOf names and so every vet count\nWhat we're doing is asking for public funds to be kept in\nSome Baldwin county school board members say the same thing\nBecause we're scrambling for those precious dollars\nBoth on camera in Baldwin county school board passed resolution encouraging state lawmakers to repeal the act\nWe've had a number of systems around the state of Alabama that have called in ... many some have asked me to use a resolution as a template\nSupporters of the act said they want to give parents the choice to decide where their children get an education\nAnd for us to try to take that away and education that is offered [noise]\nSenator Trent ... says you do not only have to be zoned for a failing school to receive the scholarship and they were below a hundred and eighty five percent of the federal poverty line it can also apply to receive that scholarship on\nLibya thanks and from last year's list released back in January twenty three schools have been deemed failing in our area based on ... but at the level of those in Montgomery County which of course the school system here currently under states' intervention\nOr Thanks John Mica MRI school board by the way past that resolution asking lawmakers to repeal the accountability act five to one last night one board member was\nNot there okay so this was the Brubeck Erbil in very poor thinking very forward thinking so if you live in the ZIP Code at the school and as soon as the school you can go and be sent to another school or you can get a tuition check\nA voucher for private school\nAnd so no they we we need the money we need the money and so by not having the money for that particular school over the for the entire school system is\nSo you should get the money because you're failing your failing school\nMan that's incredible and the the way I see this is it's not even if that's the way you're going to treat it it is public phones you truly be public\nThat they are given out and therefore the parents of the children that were just a public provision of education exactly not for some government run essentially corporate monopoly with the whole public school they they separate\nGo into a governments who system right well my kids are part of the public the public but they were they were going to private school they didn't live to Bangor to help me get a mortgage or pay for the entire thing why was that bad at it\nOn this only gets triggered if your school is failing and also I Believe the scholarships that go into these opportunities scholarship funds the person like cigarette tax payer you up to designate I Want to put some of that money towards those scholarship\nThan I Know that I Know that the legislature has got to put it but I Know about what I'm saying yes to even suggest that\nThat's why me coming to you Dan and you say okay you're an electrician\nAnd you're performing poorly and you tell me that even though I'm performing poorly\nI got a huge you like you're a monopoly that's why they're doing but I Know that the legislature has got to prove it but the point I'm trying to make kids they're trying to force people or these kids and to go on to a school or they're trying to convince the legislature to improve it\nTo ... well on the books now for them and to stand and to a caller from home as Eleanor they can't get away from\n... Glen we know that\nOkay I'm pretty good ... yeah I mean it was this this beyond obvious\nRight well you know it's obvious than but they're the ones who are making decisions\nOn the county's\nSchool even if it's going to be public school board\nA was smart\nNeighbor excuse me is you know he's okay okay\nOkay well we're I'm preaching to the choir there you go\nYou mean when do you do what is your the\nTwo seven to nine to two it is ever gonna get you guys go in there for a little bit it give for some reason it gets me going I don't even have children I mean I'm a taxpayer I Do pay the sales tax\nSo it but it's a it's just frustrating I've heard about this but on the fringes that the issue of the school system or Montgomery for a while I Am abroad as a private school in Montgomery than my parents made the decision the some of the Catholic and pay for preschool\nAll through the twelfth grade but then they bit would it was hard work I mean it's\nNot cheap it's maybe cheaper than some other private schools in the area but it's not cheap by any means and they still then that's a kicker people paying bribes school are still paying taxes into the public coffers\nI can relate to them\nBasic way or [noise] um there was some kind of interesting I was on Fox It's MORNING talk about border patrol um and this guy is the head of the council for the union for border patrol they came in and endorse Trump he says something that really was kind of amazing to me\nAs we speak the Democrat Party is ultimately encouraging caravan\nAfter caravan of illegal aliens so violent outlaws and break is\nDon't worry about it folks you have nothing to worry about President Trump class had a Democrat says that caravan of migrants edges closer and closer to\nOur border and our next gas warning that a so called deep state of war President Trump and his top corner policies\nPresident of the national border patrol council Brandon Judd is here to explain brand and they're going to tell me that all border patrol hire the higher ups and and the lower are not on the same page to secure the border well\nWhat we know is is back in March of twenty sixteen when border patrol agents endorsed President Trump there was a huge backlash from management within the agency in fact ah the the deputy commissioner at the time in March and this was witnessed by several individuals have called me and he asked me to rescind my endorsement\nThat person has since been the political appointee of the presidents and we know that they just didn't support the president so if you look at the current situation\nUnder the Flores settlement agreement we have to release children within twenty days unless we send them to a state license facilities there's nothing in the settlement agreement that doesn't say that we can't send parents to state license facilities as well and\nThat's what the agency should have been working on all the way back in twenty seventeenth\nI Want to get that strength someone that now appointed by the president to work on this very issue he did not support the president\nThat he did not not in again and Mark Twain who is in its commissioner ...\n...\n... who called him and wanted him to rescind his endorsement of Trump he remembers the border patrol people were kind of a big part of that immigration\nKinda pace of the Trump up or just as the union the union this is the guy that Jeff Sessions is really good friends with\nThat when he was being on the show we'll be talking about them\nAnd he called and asked him to send it\nAnd this is the guy at the turn and found out that John Kelly\nMade the recommendation of\nThis isn't it\nSo ... is that even on the same page as the president right now these guys powerful position as there is\n... if you look at it and I'm I'm floored that that happened um but but again that's the politics\nCommissioner my when I was not the president himself in fact if you look at the New York times and New York times said that there was a huge argument over who the commissioner should be and unfortunately I'm a secretary of homeland security one out on that on a whole lot shallower\nBringing your brain pet Ted come out with this information right now let's talk about what the president what the options are because these these migrants now all they have to do is cross the border bring a child with down claim asylum and then they get into our country and like\nOn like that they can take off their their devices on our lax and Guthrie only two percent are showing up for their court hearings what's to say that all one hundred percent of the group is not going to try to claim asylum and do that very thing when they get to the border\n... well that's the trend right now if you look back in April of ... in April this year\nThe first chair of and that was organized a they came and they played a high stakes game of poker with the United states government the president said that all of these people would be held in custody pending their asylum or deportation proceedings and a pointless seem Francesca said no they're not going to win so they organize this caravan\nThey came across they cross the border illegally and we did in fact release them now that his bird a niche era ban\nBut this caravan as much larger\n...\nThat's interesting now you know Trump watches boxing weren't ... and I wonder if he's going to go and\nWhat happened to you I didn't know that hey we didn't do John Kelly's outside his door and I wonder where John Kennedy would say when he's if he was asked about it\nI Wonder too is there's there's probably more going on there for probably reasons that have to do with issues beyond homeland secure beyond just immigration enforcement but also to do with what ice\nIs dealing with in terms of homeland security that I'd imagine John Kelly likes this guy there I think there's some reason there's there's guys in the commissioner's in his position where it goes like he understands the drug cartels he understands you know anti terrorism actions\nAnd I'm sure there's something Kelly as a relationship with this guy or it's like okay\nYou know he's got to have that have something where he's earned John college which back roads there'll be young but did John Kennedy know that he called and told him not to indoors to withdraw the riches that's that doesn't look good it doesn't look good they're shown any way when they're more show will be\nBack right after this [noise]\n[noise]\nMean don't\nAnd not even really point one after him [noise]\n\nTrue [noise]\n\nRadio hour\nMonday through

that's what we do want to know what the story is all you have to do is turn on CNN MSNBC NBC and all the rest of them\nThey're telling the story and they're usually prompts boarded the water's their intention I think you're exactly right they're trying to censor Donald Trump Donald Trump slobbering them in these uh uh meetings to the town hall meetings and he's a ... a a painting\nHe's killing him because he's telling the truth and they can't afford to have somebody with that much media exposure to tell the truth ... and uh because it's hurting if\nI can tell you that those polls are accurate and they know something that the polls aren't indicating and they're scared and that's why they're pulling this thought should Donald Trump and everybody else up\nI'm pointing the fingers that the Democrats\nWith when they're dealing with the Democrat\nWhen I was a ... a couple of things here when when you say they um [noise] yeah we were having a discussion about Democrats doing this versus an individual or somebody with the intelligence espionage background [noise] see I think that I\nI don't see a collective need is a Democrat said are\nDoing that as I say I collected notice of Democrats who were trying to benefit from this and trying to take it for\nFor what it is remember that if you're in the intelligence community have said this all along which ... is this information business\nI learned that from my dealings with them in the Nineteen eighties there and that this information business so when I started analyzing this last night and looking at all of the commonality and watching how all those shows will be in play\nThen what would they did is this person is basically creating a narrative in this question is how long does it go into asked if the guy's really really good he's owning a car if he's not so good he's definitely going to get to cook but I Will let you go to the person ...\n... I'm thinking that the bottom line is doing it on the path of Democrats [noise] it might not\nHave let's say let's say doing it for the benefit of Democrats\nYeah or it could be very well be faction within the Democratic party there are a lot of things that the Democrats have done that not all Democrats were aware of it's a faction within or or someone within the leadership assigned somebody do it yeah like a good while you're in your ...\nThat's going to get found out if if you got ... Schumer coordinated some either it's going to get found out\nWe oh\nYeah but but it was just take it but when it could be here and the simple solution and that this person is either really mature doesn't know crap\nOr in the security plan which they're sitting by the way the secret service did great um they don't want the secret service investigated sort of FBI most likely be looking at\nUm of one of the things that I think it's going to be a give away here guys and I and he is the um the label\nYou know when I was doing fraud cases specifically counterfeiting one of the things we had we we investigated was called\nPinochet's computer printed fake money and it'll leave a certain signature in the printing so I Believe the principal labels are going to give away some incredible clues as to where uh what type of a minimum what type of print or this was and that'll be one of the baby clothes in addition to fingerprint they at least the signature on it\nAnd it seemed like there were two names over misspelled\nDebbie Wasserman shows which was the return address\nAnd John Brennan misspelled\nAlso the John Brennan package which has CNN when he worked at MSNBC let me turn to something out there mhm none of these packages reached the person who was supposed to go to\n\nSo if John Brennan winter vaccine gotten a package and MSNBC and they deliver that package to him and how he responded to that would have been very interesting\n\nIs similar in misspelling John Brennan his name kind of saying I really don't know him the member and the intelligence community deception is what they're all about is misinformation ... direction\nSuicide bombers basically saying no I don't know ...\n\nAnd if a bomb would have shown up at MSNBC and would have been delivered to John Boehner's office or handed to them\n\nAnd what they did is they put a little barrier in there so to the phones you go to the soldier boy sociable and we're going forward today Moshe\n... enjoy them and I found out what was it in a Maxine Waters or a box that was delivered what it was a new set of wigs\n[laughter] okay\nWashington sold says she probably has a mascara loud tons of makeup in order to simply amazes me that the Democrats and the far left when all these Republicans were being harassed and in in restaurants in ... in rocks going through buildings and stuff and all this violence not one Democrat\nHas come down to the condemned this at all and now suddenly they want to play the motor\nOh yeah\nThat's all get along I I notice a week later can't we all just get along kind of like the Rodney King or you know we we shouldn't be doing ... stuff and this and everything but if you don't condone it I mean if you don't condemn it your condoning it and that's exactly what they were doing\nAnd now they just try to lift the ... the the or the or the other side of the coin over and trying to play the victim card it's it's pathetic\nIt really isn't that that's one of the things they've caught my eye yesterday when I was watching how and particularly this morning when I was watching maker and watching the news last night and looking at the different places is ...\nThey were calling it wouldn't Hillary Clinton how she was handling and particularly Schumer and Pelosi saying what Trump said it wasn't enough and it's almost like they did have a heads up or something but didn't know exactly what it was\nToo much of a coincidence or like your you mentioned earlier and when your callers mentioned to none of them got exploded\nNo no no no we got to the person and none of them did under them exploded\nCoincidence all this happened to be on the same that person whoever did it is going to have is what is going to find themselves on the side of the street with a bullet in his back of his head and I got savers robbery and you're still going to have his wallet in his back pocket in his watch on his wrist\n[noise] that's how they cover it up well it's going to be in this

figure at the point or those on this and that may have been a mistake that an espionage type person where they may\nI noticed one thing too it's taking the uh the camera and the lens off the invasion that's coming through Mexico too I noticed that perfect timing\nWe're yeah we're absolutely obsessed with this thing and the question is are there more to come\nOr you remember when they when they

that sounds like me because even if it was a private courier nobody does that and you know what to eat or out on a short nobody's there was an open 'til nine o'clock by\nYou know the key is this is another [noise] device apparently a suspicious package delivered to Robert Deniro as a building where he has her business is not\nTo did not explode in the New York times this morning regarding this uh you know nobody knows at this point I'm terribly without the New York times writes some bomb technicians who studied photos of the devices circulating on social media is the sense of CNN [noise] suggested\nThat the bomb had the hallmarks of fake explosives the kind more typically depicted on TV shows and in the movies rather than\nDevices capable of detonating they write a digital clock was taped to the middle of the pipe a feature that experts say it's typically shown on fictional bombs in an attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension but unnecessary in real life\nIn fact bomb makers generally avoid attaching visible clocks to their devices to keep from tipping off their targets about when bombs are set to explode so that just goes to the whole what exactly was the intent of this device\nYeah you're right Steven that that's well said by whoever point that out to the you know the the bombs have really two components have an explosive explosive material and initiate her hobbies initiate or is there are a real things are so many ways to initiate an explosive cascade okay it's only a few ways to do it to put a digital clock on their\n... you're right is is is is so amateurish that\nIt almost says that this person want this device to detect age I'm as some means to terrorize and get a message out there without\nHaving the actual devices that pain or even in some of these cases appearing capable of doing Dannemora show\nShannon [noise]\nSoon as those who to ...\n[noise] hey Dan how are you doing good how are you I think\nThere's a little update on the Robert Deniro thing I think it kind of jumped the gun on that one and they found out that it it was a bomb it was actually just his last movie the end\n[laughter] which which could be done about\nThis which was a bomb [laughter] so um I don't know I'm I'm Still a out there and and the camp of I think this is a dirty tricks off flag crap uh I mean the only thing I was missing or the acme\nSign on the bombs in turn address\nLabel yeah you know it just it just seems all to bat and everybody just happens to be every person in the news too you know Trump is having a feud with the ... had said bad things about him uh you know especially like deniro I mean that guy he's I think he's a craze lunatic\nYou know I think it maybe now any sustain a restaurant and try back a little bit longer no so because he certainly is a is just absolutely and say hey I'm some some of the new poll out today I Want to know if you take a look at any of those um\nEspecially saying a Kramer\nWas sixteen over high camp now\nYeah that's that's definitely a done deal there\nYeah it sounds like it and I saw the uh Josh Hawley now plus seven over McCaskill on a recent poll and then um Nevada pillars of plastics over Rosen cruises kind of fluctuating between five and seven over a I call them beta boy [laughter]\nBronze plans for the the more interesting one is the Morsi a mansion poll that has more ... by two [noise] that was pretty interesting\nThat that is but I don't don't you think this could be an outlier yeah\nI Would say it is I I Would say mansions seems to be [noise] you know going to relax and of course Florida still kind of dead heat plus or minus one depending on what you're looking at but I I'll be honest with you I I think [noise] I think all these polls are having issues um\nI don't think a lot of Trump people uh answer polls I Know I don't any more um you know just don't feel like debating with people when they call or especially on a push polls um\nI and I think the methodology is tough now with people with cell phones and landlines and well I mean what are your thoughts about just the overall how much more difficult is to actually get a good valid polling sample\nWell I think that one of the problem is when I was in the east coast could they in turn ozone him is that uh they they're using waiting in it so\nNow we are both do do do waiting that they'll have thirty five percent or Democrat twenty nine percent over Republican in the western independence fry and by the the waiting is off and protect you don't think there's any ... ... ...\n... yeah they used to overweight Democrats now the overweight independence\nWill end it should be on it but they but I don't look at these posts new have Democrats had thirty nine percent and a Republican said thirty one percent and then ... percent independent is just not correct\nWell yeah if you go back and look at what the percentages were let's say in the two twenty sixteen election you would at least want to look at that no no um or or or or the previous mid term elections in terms of voter registration but\nYou know I I I still think that Democrats are going to be crying in their beer and Republicans are going to hold the house\nAnd pick up I was thinking you know we'd be lucky if we picked up three or four seats in the Senate but I mean there's a possibility of five or six if things really go that way I mean what what are you hearing about the uh the early\nReturns and so forth I'm Still here and really solid numbers for Republicans\nYou hear about the early vote\nEarly vote yeah and only only scientists not read read slow isn't about and that doesn't worry me right now\nNo because I Know from their pattern Nevada is they Republicans a turn out in droves and catch up on election day on that seems to be their history in Nevada at least that I can recall\nRight everything is ... county is ... counties in ... in the Los Vegas a much higher in\nRight so uh so I'll ask you the question I asked me last week if you had to predict today how many states will the Dems pick up and the house and how many are Republicans pick up and the Senate\nI think that uh three or four in the Senate for Republicans and I'm not quite sure because of the house thing is to fluid and his opinion dynamic research has said\nThat it is getting more and more difficult to poll the sixty nine and he'd do is to say that they've been polling um because of a lot of different things whether and and his wife people's habits are this time of the year but um\nMid seventies Sunday should be a great day risk of a couple of showers by Sunday night\nFrom the blue water weather center this is rich Thomas\nBy um attorneys sausage groves inviting you to attend the successful aging boot camp and Archibald senior center on November first if you were raised to five this is a must have been called six born on for nine one one registered see sort of limited called six or nine for nine one one to register\nMainframe media Walter or saw station so they want to see\nThe New York post had something else they\nSay the pipe bomb center CNN appears to including ISIS parity flag with a phrase on it that says get her done well solar the cable guy\nYeah I got to tell you I'm really really skeptical of uh about this stuff this just seems so\nOver the top that it makes you really shouldn't even be curious as to what his motive could have possibly been\nAgain look at all the factors here they be excessive I mean overly excessive postage that wasn't even stamped in many cases in other words hey look at me for this being tied to big type on these envelopes again screaming to look at the symbol of gum pull this out you have this really heavy packaging\nYou have just just a ridiculous errors like the misspelling I'm John Brennan's name rice and\nA package being sent the CNN he you know he works at a different network he doesn't work and see it as more so angry at him to do this ridiculously Savage jak you think you'd at least get the network it just doesn't make any sense nothing makes sense of this\nJust one other component to this and and we don't know who did this we have no idea but then again maybe they didn't explode because the bomb maker was really bad at it I doubt that\nIt's bad dealing with the explosive material blackout\nOr whatever it may be you usually see some kind of negative incident in the past and someone reported it to the police force you see these bomb makers blow themselves up I mean this is pretty common in a few people have no idea what this is so amateurish was intentionally Dannemora show [noise]\n\nThe White House was Jose is how do you know when you say you're banned by making them [noise] and then having a hard [laughter] new diseases is going to go crazy you go to the phones your junior junior ...\nHey how you doing things for taking my call she was in a caravan coming our way might be a little harsh but I don't think another one would try it if we opened fire with rubber bullets in the crowd and aim high so we don't have kids\nWould that be too harsh I I tell you would ever is done everything's it'd be centered around the optics of it and say you were neighbors and so my needs to stand back and say what is this going to cry on camera\nRight\nDon't you remember the pictures of the kids in the cages and all that kind of stuff they're the they're looking for the odd things a bit to make it a bad story\nAnd I'm looking for something to make it here and you're looking for something what\nTo make it in to make a stop no more ... coming our work well changing alone would be very very helpful your word I just want to run that by science can I can you push it\nTo go to ... it was going out none of my friend what are you up to\nAh I'm I'm Glad we tried it in the hot weather for the rainy weather Robin joy and there's a lot of 'em yeah sure I Am I tell you you know all this talk about\nThe um the\nBombs and all that or whatever are being used as in other crops and stuff out of a\nUm you know real bombs and everything you just wait to see if the left has already done it they will start saying look look the Republicans are ups upset 'cause nobody got blown up you know you're not\nSaying we're not saying that were upset 'cause nobody got blown up were you know it's ... cause nobody did any in any halfway go to Mike ... a one or two or three of them go off right\nWell I noticed two things that happen today John Homan Morning Joe use the false flag narratives\nWhere he said you know what the news I just sort of ... that the Democrats who really bonded type thing and he he put that out there today\nI Believe it is the first hour when all of this started happening to lots of one okay yeah tell me the one about the three bears this one's Wylie coyote and the road runner it off this one's getting old already yeah um I I don't know I I just uh but you know thankfully the same agency the uh\nUh the ... or ... used bike information the ... they're investigating this now we'll get to the bottom of it objectively another family matter either\nWay whoever and they're the ones that are so as a person who did the post flag narrative was John Brennan\nHey did you and I bet that\nIt uh yeah he did when he was doing an interview on stage\nYou know what maybe you know I think it was what ... ... there's been devoted burn up the midnight oil to do a little maybe a call for\nA minute ... percent expected in this whole thing to John Brennan\nWell and that would be great for him to so yeah I think it's a false flag you know that that that that's the way for them to\nAlso misspelling you name the name of the package diverge from him to also to uh CNN Bush's MSNBC\n\nDot to not know what you said that well but that's why that's why you might the big bucks not far away all literally\nA British could I could you read it at all have a good afternoon acts like he missed a plane there's a montage of the major you kind of a sense of where we get back to dampen budget you know these are the talking heads\nIf you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed we have\nA president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraged violence against the media and we we are in an era now where violence seems to have licensed by the president to the United states\nPresident certainly has encouraged to kind of rhetoric is what happened when the president called the enemy of the people that we did not hear the president accept any bit of responsibility for something that he and his supporters are due in lead\nDonald Trump too often has helped to incite or some of these feelings of anger there's less violence\nAnd you go that was bringing the very end there there's going to do ... what was it a murder shown on Thursday

up everyone\nYeah and you know you're trying to break the mirror gentlest plan you know a ... he hears the he was the one bumped on the road none of them expected to have to deal with and uh I I'm Sorry I'm just watching this this\nCycle of news we've seen this week a judicial watch I just posted this from Facebook went down to Guatemala and has learned that this caravan is extremely well organized and doesn't include elements of human trafficking in it\nAnd it's um you know I there's people that are also determined to get to the truth\nI think what we have to hope and pray they're the ones the prevailing I'm Talking about that not Amazon and Google but on these other stories you know uh\nThose bombs were Joe\nYou know they had ... but in digital watches the not even alarms in ... there was no chance any of them would ever explode [noise] um\nBut it is that designed to drive sympathy it out some evil conservative probably wanted to blow all those wonderful number so\nI I'm just it's just crazy I've never seen anything like this before\nNo you're right I agree with all of that it is totally insane and um it\nReally really almost ... speech or ... you know I Know what else can you say except it's just it's really scary\nBut at the ... the places I go and the places I looked for specific feedback on I'm seeing is a doubling down on the determination to votes and reaffirmed as president\nFrom the everyday Americans that put him in office in the first place horrible looking at how we still packing giant auditoriums Brandt the guy's a rock star he fills the capacity thousands waiting a you know they can't get in\nSo somebody likes the guy and I don't think it's just the people that are showing up at these [noise] so it's\nThey're they're you know I get ya and and and I and let me just say I agree and and for the same reason that I understand why he was elected in the first place\nListen you know how many times do we talk about you know how could people vote for Obama or a liberal in\nParticularly when it comes to economics and capitalism and what we always say you know you can be lied to so many times before finally do the the people are gonna throw him out because life or the average American family was not getting better getting more\nAnd so they said we're going to give Trump to try and and guess what he's delivering\nAnd that's why I think what you're saying is it is happening at these arenas and all over the country I'm the same thing\nLife has gotten better and it's resonating with the average American family all over the country are and I think I I don't I don't question that at all like I said though they have to have a read them get out and vote\nThe conservative too I think Kavanaugh was one of the ... the I guess what the Democrats also need to read and to get out something to offset that momentum and do we see bombs than we seek caravans of the all the stuff you know this is this is what politics\nIn terms of economic than in terms of what's happening in the market and I do think I I really am convinced that a higher interest rate these terrorists that are that are beginning to really start to leak their way into the\nProfit margins of the company because a lot of companies are talking about it now and I do think it's real ... uh we're beginning to see that impact if you look at all the sector across the country and that make up the s than the five hundred\nOr many of those factors probably Ninety percent of them are down this year ...\nUh and some are down ten Fifteen twenty percent ... there are certain factors that are down over thirty wow and a lot of this is because there's a fear of the backdrop is happening around the globe you look at Europe which is the leverage to the gills do you look at China which has enormous amounts of debt\nOr those economies are not doing well all of those markets are down or the Chinese market is down over thirty percent from the heat\nAnd so there and so the people here in the U.S or in to spend money managers are beginning to look at the United states and say well we've got a wonderful broke or a year\nBut with the interest rate going up like they are on and these tariffs going up like they are they're going to be potentially significant headwind or these us a multinational company going into twenty Nineteen and that's where the concern is coming from\nA particularly next to you got to think about the euro your comparison say first quarter of Nineteen the first quarter of Eighteen years you're going to be tougher comparison as we move through and so you throw in there those big headway in the booth that make it a little bit difficult and so I think yeah\nThere are there are forces that work around the world that are that are you know fully funded deeply entrenched the drought on the Trump and blow down his momentum but likewise I think there are also forces at work in the market that are not so much politics\nAre and you know and that's why a lot of people including the president have been telling the fed chairman\nYou gotta you gotta you gotta hit pause on these Bryant high I mean look you know so I could go on and on um the home sales numbers down five and a half percent this boy if that was an out that's because your mortgage rate\nI Hope the fed paying attention to the thing and um\nAnyway ... going to be an exciting day I'll Try to call in and and a comment on it if if we can and ah\nSo ... we'll look forward to it in the meantime\nHave this kind of wisdom of phone call away by calling three eight seven

I I think you know ... is he came to me one day and he said I have an idea\nBut how do you price in the improvements in cancer treatment that have happened over the last Twenty years it's very difficult to arrive Steve or which one of the chapter authors he's he's very sensitive to this because he is he's a cancer survivor now ... yeah he's gone through treatment in the past year and a half\nAnd he was he benefited from a treatment that was unavailable Fifteen Twenty years ago\nAnd he says you know how do you put that into\nNot just inequality statistics but how do you put that into understanding what people's standard of living is and how it's changed over the years\nRight and like just take entertainment because I I consume a lot of it I tried to provide a certain degree\nIs like I'll go back from the ... second watch say while I was doing it just this week from a permits early nineties wrestling mhm the footage is grainy in a way it's not as bad as say like some of the seventies wrestling\nBut the footage is not that great the graphics are kind of cheesy or the audio does all patchy here or there over modulated in certain ways and yet I'm streaming this audio and video on a Internet\nThat an Internet network that nobody could have imagined when say Vince McMahon the owner of the WWE takes over\nAnd like he for years talked about imagining an a network that ... and they thought maybe a cable channel [laughter] and then it became know this whole Internet thing and I can just ... ... my own lifetime the whole idea of of watching a movie watching a show it's just completely changed\nAnd yes we can put dollars and cents to that and that's important\nUm to directing what people actually want\nBut it's also how do I how do I value that are put a price on now instead of owning a huge DVD collection\nAlmost every piece of television or movies or music is now the ... touch for like ten Ninety nine a month it's just it's like it's difficult for me to uh\nPut in certain terms and I'm sure you could in terms of like money and but in terms of standard of living that's just the entertainment\nLose everything has changed because of certain technological changes\nAnd I imagine you know get into that a little bit that it's it's almost like individual people and certain technologies and products\nAnd for instance you brought up the the median wages or to start there if you look over the decades there might be a full and the median wage or the median income or it might look like the one percent is getting more\nBut as I was reading today you shared a great piece of there is a difference if you look at individual people in those categories what tends to happen over say what has happened over the last two three decades if you look at individual people in those categories\nRight see and that's one thing that I Believe is a little misleading about how the statistics work even if you're looking at the top one percent or you're looking at the top twenty percent or the bottom twenty percent\nWhen you look at how those change over time and you say oh the top one percent now has a ... a larger share they have a smaller share what you're missing is there is no such thing\nHuman wise as the top one percent it's not the same people and the top one percent\nA surprising number I think it's pushing thirty percent maybe it's down around twenty seven percent of the surprising number of people find themselves at some point in the top one percent\nOn the income scale and that's because they'll have a house or a large capital gain or they'll receive a lump sum from ... from their pension plan or something right there that that one ... right or an inheritance and ... and so a surprising number of people for at least one year of their adult lives\nFind themselves in the top one percent and that's not intuitive\nRight and so comparing that over time doesn't really make a lot of sense it's different people and many people may be moving towards each other and the distribution is continually changing\nIn terms of the people in that distribution and where they are there are new people coming in their immigrants there are young people who are getting their first jobs and have lower incomes there are people who have earned a lot over their lifetime but then retire and are hurting as much if you're looking at income\nAnd so there's a lot of churn there's demographic changes there's changes in households and because so much of this was based on the tax a tax data\nFrom tax returns you have to understand there's a big change in terms of how people file their taxes whether they're married filing jointly or married filing separate layer single or qualifying cup qualifying widow or widower with dependence\nRight and more than that changes in the tax code changes\nWhat kinds of numbers people report in terms of personal income for all of those things have to do with choices that people make in terms of who's in the household how many people are in the household how they file their taxes what counts as income and what doesn't this year\nAnd even when those things change has inequality really changed between Joey in states right right and that's that's a point I Want to make is that any quality is something that exist between people right it's not something that exists between statistical categories\nNot in our intuitive\nSense of inequality right when we turn around and call you were thinking about inequality between people were thinking about poor people on this side of a wall or the slums of Mumbai versus the big skyscrapers on the other side with thinking about the people in those buildings in those shacks versus in those skyscrapers\nWere not thinking about statistically\nAnd that's what I was drawn to a voice to is that I I'm thinking about like myself and other people I see like okay are they getting a fair shake you don't want to make something clear in terms of like income like even if I Do see\nAnd er and somebody just one near the mega millions jackpot I don't ... and maybe it's just me I don't have an impulsive like that's unfair that they have that much money and I don't I don't have the impulse to me but I Do have an impulse to me that is in this other ... inequality in or a quality that you bring up\nIs that did somebody lie cheat or steel to get that power over somebody else did somebody lied cheater steal to get that money\nIt's it's interesting how that really will go and then that would piss me off and that I care about I care about fairness I care about is their justice actually being served I don't care if somebody has more money in ... as long as they did it in a just a way\nAnd yet and sometimes I I hear my friends on less than their friends they seem to conflate the person is has the monetary wealth and that there's almost an implicit assumption that it's a that it's wrong and this all has to be kind of unpacked in a way\nYeah and it makes international comparisons difficult to LA because in some countries that may be more or less true Mm right is that in some countries that may be that\nOut of all the wealthy people are all the high income people in the country the majority really are crooked and its allies spit it ill gotten game yeah\nSo what would a quality require right a quality would require maybe that the outcomes differ a little bit some people have a nice new Mercedes some people drive an old Honda right it\nIt it allows for some of that any quality but we don't feel like it's correct you're right justice justice is probably more what people care about as a matter of fact what I'm what I Would I realized as I think one of the issues with the inequality measures\nIs they're trying to make inequality something positive and the economic sense something objective and they won't want to come up with an objective standard and the objective standard is always perfect equality right\nRight the top one percent should have no more than one percent of the wealth right right and that's the idea is that it would be perfect equality that every person earns roughly the same or receives roughly the same in income\nAnd that's totally quality and then how far you are from that objective standard is how unequal your society but inequalities probably in right for our intuition when we think and say inequality it's more of a normative concept it's a value Judgement\nRight it's about is that fair is that just is there an outrageous gap\nBetween people right not just an incidental one right in there and this is interesting to be the people that money is corrupt and you know to a certain extent we both love I think moral philosophy yeah so like yeah if you just love money for money's sake you know one of the money\nMay be the root of all evil fair enough money for money say can be corrupting but I was a fun story I was listening to this morning a pod cast\nI'm In the eighties there was this um wrestler and then you might remember him tend to be off the the million dollar mess and they wanted him to be a bad guy when they're first crafting this character\nAnd the million dollar man really comes out of that idea that this is Vincent man he he hated when people would smoke around them so we pay them to stop smoking a cigarette\nSo everybody's got a price and but they want the be all she did go down in the ring and start paying people do humiliating things and out of this is like oh look at him corrupting people and make them do terrible things\nSo I started to save and then I bought a real estate investment started to rent it out and make money that way bought another house and she started to build up that wealth through real estate\nAnd what amazed me is instead of and then the person originally asked questions said thank you two are and and asked her a few more follow ups but there are a few people responded go oh so now you're a slum lord instead of provide head\nAnd it's just absurd and I think folks if one lesson I've learned that mentality is destructive\nIt will not help you personally I don't think it'll help the community generally and it's why I have sponsors like ... or what the goods and group on here because that's how he changed his life he was working a job that he was proud to have but it was a nine to five job and he saved up bought real estate investment properties\nAny rented them out it went from one to two to three or four to five and and he's like okay now I can quit that job I can be a landlord now I'm going to be a real estate agent\nAnd that's when ... got in contact with me and he really folks wants to be your buyers agent so if you're thinking of I Want to buy a home\nThink Eddie ... with the goods and group is number three two two zero six six to he wants to be your buyers age and but what exactly does that mean well it means that you are looking to buy a home\nUm he can help you avoid some of the pitfalls of oh no we bought a fixer upper that needs new you know heating and a C needs all these different things she can negotiate that in the process of buying the home he can negotiate\nAnd the actual buying of the home closing costs warranties again or repairs that might need to be made I mean\nBig purchase it's a big money decision it can be emotional that's why you need a buyer's agent like Eddie better with the good group but here's the best thing when you're talking about a buyer's agent it's free\nHow is that true well it is it's free because\nEvery residential real estate transaction oh commissions are paid by the seller\nSo there you go you know it'd be negotiated they give Eddie ... with the good singer because he will be your buyers ages three two two zero six six to three two
