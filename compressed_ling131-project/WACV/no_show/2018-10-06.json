man\nIs he is I think he's a what'd you say he's probably one of the most successful money man I Will say all of his time I mean some kind of moved on from that I'm sure when you go back to it you know and I\nI'm going to say this we the the money men like me mhm are trying to mirror image of what he's doing other words take some of this new stuff and that's why we're going to talk about today some of the new things that you have no idea maybe you do\nThat Donald Trump is trying to do for you open avenues for you money man money women have they need to be on top of it if you're talking to someone who says Donald Trump is not the man maybe you don't need to use that plane\nBut if you talk to someone who is appreciative of what a what Donald Trump doing and uh I Am I'm One of those that really thinks that he's the man he's the man with a plan and I really think that we need to pay close attention to\nAnd and we're going to talk about some of the things that he his opening the doors for us and he's all with 'em up for us to do and money man come true we're going to use those things\nWhere you know I wrote him a letter you did you how did that 'cause you know they say we're you know heavy risks that we ... had that whereas the crowd you know 'cause he's he's like the chief right now as far as the president ... so and you know he's he's a billionaire\nAnd offered to take all five six eight million dollars just hold it for oh okay\nYeah you know we'll have to worry about it all just kind of well I mean it gets kind of big low down and you know me being a good American Idol

all related to come over here with a ... Volkswagen or in the Bible you know you don't come here and I'm\nA big your people's car let the people over there and grab a yes\nThere's a funny joke about that you know they put that wall up uh-huh and I like the week before they put the wall all actually two days before the put the wall up yeah one guy comes over into\nTo East Germany yeah and he takes his car posted in shock ... and the gases ... when's it going to be ready said Tuesday [laughter] is is okay when he goes back over the other side over there to West Germany I Hope I got this right\nThank you rescue man you just keep on making me feel is a man\nOr I'm here for so today we're talking about the the things that ah can make you feel warm and fuzzy a new new laws in a how Trump is coming out with some new stuff\nMhm and uh I understand he's coming out with a lot of stuff that's going to help people who were trying to put away money for their retirement\nThat's right now a lot of people say well you know my retirement is going to get locked up I've got a a as a retirement program back a little I did a little chastising a little earlier before the break a\nMedical workers are being done wrong in this city because they should be able to take money I Wonder if it demand and a half or even though they're still employed if anyone is listening to this is a management person you can change that all you gotta do sale investment company to change that or get the you know what out ... and lives will be another one that will do it for you\nNow I Want to say right now I Know for a fact\nThat uh and you do too I'm sure in in the medical field right you know nurses work hard they sure do now when they went on that TV show what was it the view\n... odd just want to put my foot through the television talking about nurses didn't work hard and they or you know just a bunch of prima donnas now know that these are not been in the hospital is and I know you know nurse comes in their spends ten minutes with me I'm not one not only one on that floor and she's got to look after\nAnd you know I'm a ...\nThese people deserve the respect of course their male nurses to right they're out there and there were there taking care of folks and then not getting the appreciation and they they don't need this this problem that you just mentioned well it's not just nurses\nGet to your laboratory people ... who who should have a lot more respect in you know they're they're kind of like the unknowns you got the X ray and the radiological paypal or you've got to physical therapy people you've got all the you got all these different aspects\nYou you've got the transportation people you've got the pharmacy\nYou know everybody works as a as a you know as a unit that drove the hospital or machine right\nAh but the fact is when you when when I went on hospital\nPuts together a retirement plan and they get snow covered and I'm going to use the word snuck it by the investment uh people ...\nInto a allowing a contract to sign that they can't take the money out when they're fifty nine and a half and maybe even though they're stealing board ... is something wrong with it because a lot of people break down and they want to start working part time or they want to work\nOr somewhere else and keep that job a little bit you know but the fact that they if they work in just one day a month\nThat investment company says you can't have your money and you're like sixty five sixty six seven years oh almost and you can't get any money\nThen you have to quit your job so you get your money that's something wrong with that picture of you know a lot of people when they get to that in half they deserved they said well we're just doing it so that they cause they might spend their money I get that pitcher but what if you're fifty nine and a half and you've got quite a bit of money and then you want to take some of it out and put it\nDid they don't have a safe mode that you could go into and then you're kind of stuck in a mode that you don't want to be and they need to put some more liquidity in these things so these four O. one K. is are getting that way ... the I'm I'm Talking ... more bad about for three days and four fifty seven and\nA uh those those plans haven't gotten to where the four oh one case have got raw one K. is they're still not where they need to be ... but the full ... have more protection mechanism a lot of them will allow you to take out a what they call a just a withdrawal\nAnd usually they put in there like fifty nine and a half is usually the the primary age but they can put in their forty five\nThey can put thirty five mhm it's all in the plan documents okay\nIn the in the more liberal it is I see people all the time and trying to borrow their own money out of a for all three bay paying interest they're restricted they don't get their money okay some people would not save I get I get the ... but when you're fifty nine and a half and you can get your money I think he went too far with it way too far\nSo how can you tap\nYour retirement savings without getting hit with a penalty by the government that's\nAnother story but we're going to talk about a centrally or that's called a Seventy two tea you say what is a Seventy to take as many as ... Seventy two T distribution oh are you know\nLet's say you did have a four O. one K. they would allow you to take some money out before you were fifty nine and a half okay and if you worry then you're you're dealing with a good company okay maybe you can be forty five\nSo you say look I'm going to continue to work\nBut I Need to get a hold of some of that money because I've got children to send the college I got this got that and ah maybe they set up a program for the for the the nice thing with Trump maybe they didn't and we're going to get more into that\nSo the Seventy two tea will let you take a distribution of payments\nOver a certain period of time I think it's five years do hope that\nAt a certain amount you can't turn it off you can but if you do then all of them the money if the penalty okay so if you had a hundred thousand dollars maybe you could take out five thousand dollars or ten thousand or whatever the number would be\nPer year with out of the penalty you do have to pay taxes if his before when Ralf no you would not pay taxes on that\nA and a lot of people say well how would that help her four oh one wrong you don't have the votes taxes anyway keep in mind you've got to be fifty nine and a half to take money out of a rough regularly without any taxes a lot of people don't know that there's two guidelines on or off\nOur eyes and for one case and that it's one you you need to be in there at least five years you\nGot to satisfy that bright and fifty nine and a half which ever\n... in other words if you are sixty two and you just did it you just a then you'd have to use that stay in five years if you just put it in rye rye if you were if you were fifty five\nAnd you put it in a row and then you turn fifty fifty nine and a half or a really sixty at that time you'd be sixty then you could take money out without any tax or you just got another little loopholes about it\nAnd that's where someone like me comes that's David Ernest right there to seven nine seven four\nThree want he knows the little ins and outs the loop holes what's what what are the say the the the the Eddie and the flow of the whole thing he knows all about it and doing it for Thirty years\nCalled him up to seven nine seven four three one and talk to them about your finances to say\nYeah you want to make more have it\nAvoid penalties a lot of people don't realize that your four one K. using near our raves and you're for all three days even if they were to allow you to take the money out which for freebie usually won't uh there's a ten percent penalty on top of taxes\nAre in it lifts your fifty nine and a half a lot of people say well how does that equate well we'll give you an example\nLet's just say that you have had this happen people come to me so I Am I'm In trouble but I Need my retirement money and I said well look\nI'm you're going to get hit hard how's that going to happen held already well I'm fifty five okay\nCan you wait until you're fifty nine and a half no can't do it I got to pay this house off why you gotta pay the house off well I just have to de ... says that I say branch who say that I had to [laughter] well now sometimes people get into a pickle I had somebody they had was trying to do from one house to the other and\nAh they couldn't get a loan unless they got the other one paid off who so they could have been some creativity done there where they could have took some money out of an hour I paid the house of\nBeen sold it there and that ah sixty day period hopefully if they didn't ... then they're gonna get crushed but the you got sixty days to do a roll over that still law as long as you do one hour a year if you do more than what I re the government always listens to these companies\nThere's a few companies and I'm not going to name him 'cause I I really dislike them but I don't want to get sued so\nI'm not going to name [laughter] but they went to the IRS and\nSaid hey why don't you stop them don't let them take more than one hour a a year that they're doing this and they're doing that then he might not be getting your taxes why and they said okay so that went along with it\nSo you you ... they don't want you to be able to be creative so you've got to be one step ahead ... if you're going to be creative creative creativity stifled\nA lot of times so this is some stuff hopefully Trump is working on trying to stop and the other thing is there there are few unknown laws which are not really laws because they're called uh they're called letters a of decision they say what they call they're called ...\nThey're not in that they're not in the law of the unwritten law there there is something where you get all you get a letter from the IRS saying that you can do it\nBut it's like between the one company and they are is then you take that and you can use that as an argument and ah\nSo sometimes the these are companies have gotten permission from the IRS to do something and then you can use that as a basis but a lot of the CPAs and the tax attorneys may not always know it\nWho ... said was at the party and question could corroborate her claims she said she felt pressure\nTo change our sworn statement by a former FBI agent she felt pressured because she said I Can't ...\nCan't repeat it but I Can't ... I don't know ... I was never had a party with having all as describes my Ford and then those who are pretending this isn't about truth injustice and ... fact finding a pressuring her to change her story which is a fancy words saying asking her to lie\n... crime yes all correct\n... lot of academia look that after this who ... who the forwards identity will kind of emails we're going back and forth why Dianne Feinstein recommended these uh democratic activist\nLawyers to afford why they never told her she can testify in private and keep her ... her face in her name out of the press as much as she could she could just do it in California they go to them that's something that Senator Lindsey Graham told me right away he said she can do it by phone we can send somebody out there\n... they needed to clean slate and the cameras\nUm for them and I guess there next ... be so it it's just been awful but America has been watching and I don't the after he's confirmed and hopefully he will be I won't get ahead of the way certain senators are grappling with their vote decide devote Lara but\nUm if drug capital is confirmed as adjusted to the United States Supreme court this will not end there they think it won't end because ... men they've never met for things these men have never done to them personally and individually but\nOther folks won't forget how people behaved how they were ... try ... drawing them out of restaurants publishing their their kids names and their personal home addresses ... that's not that's not the first amendment that's just crazy that's crazy\nYou know do you um think that and part ... men are are you argue this last week uh when the president came out of the press conference which I think was one of his best press conferences for his incredible and ... could have gone for three hours [noise] ah that he taught\nUp a really made ... lost some much needed lessened the Republicans ... fight for what you believe in a fight for principle fight for person instead of being back on your heels cowering and an elevator\nThat the the reason ... elected as because he wasn't gonna take that any more he wasn't going to just keep getting pummeled and beyond perpetual a perpetual apology tore free themself for America and he he's not ... they called him ... I think the bullies are the people\nWho are swarming individuals in public or the Senate or restaurants\nAnd and ... screaming at them within ... centimeter of their skin\nBut I think trumps taught the Republicans ... throughout this whole thing\n... shock me just last night after I was on your TV show and thanks for having me uh that the way everybody describes\nBank and when I don't see from him he's fuming he's throwing things at the TV he's angry he's a bully it's exactly who they used to come he's not that way how they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job numbers and and bringing peace across the world and bring it make us prosper it\nAt home if he's sitting there fuming all day they they owned the acrimony down there for two pretty vicious wave via way they've gone after people um according to one gender according to one's politics and you're so right he doesn't retreat and back down when he believes in a principal\nOr a principal in this case PAL Brett Kavanaugh and they didn't know each other before this they didn't know each other well at all but the President Saleh judge Kavanaugh somebody who sat\nSo they sitting on the DC circuit second highest court in the land over three hundred dishes judicial opinions that none of these Democrats even try to pick apart I respect them far more Lars they said you know we have a problem with the five following opinions that he wrote and these particular passages we think he went outside the\nContours of the constitution the law there is no such are no doubt on about ... they're talking about a passage from a yearbook you can sit in a post it note versus three hundred judicial opinions the answers to twelve hundred written questions over one million documents you need a Mack truck the hall around all this stuff he's produced and you need a post it\nTo talk about a passage in your book so this just drive a lot of Americans even apolitical Americans Laura as illogical and beyond commonsense I respect them more if they said we're angry last election two years ago and that President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary was constitutional less than all this nonsense\nWe're going to later on in the show Kelly and have a discussion about what these currents feminists are doing to poison the relationship between men and women and specifically the ah\nThis idea that if you're if you're an accuser\nYou must be heard and you must be believed in if you're not believe in there and the woman or you're anti victim and jumped the promises talked about this a lot you know the ... we all have to stop\nIdentifying ourselves as victims of the victims of that because I mean that's not going to help you advance of the person as being at a victim\nDoesn't and that every every man as a perpetrator every man has to shoulder the burden of the me too movement every man is a rape is every man is a sexual harassed or by virtue of their gender and then everyone is a victim\nOn even those who many who are that have been victims of sexual misconduct or worse don't necessarily consider themselves victims overall and that's being lost and they didn't here as well I mean if you if you asked\nIf you do one of those are asking everybody who's out there with the masking tape on their mouths and those signs are holding up why are they there what this what is this about\nIt you're going to get answers that I really have nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used at Ford because they they breached her anonymity they revealed her identity to their world is out on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even gain or even the of telling her what her rights were what she could do and they're using Kavanaugh and his shoulders should not be should not be shouldering the entire me to live in by the way large ding ding ding happy anniversary one year anniversary\nOf the me too movement but you know who started it not break Kavanaugh Harvey Weinstein ... wearing today it was Harvey Weinstein major democratic donor you're not going to find him in a picture of the Brett Kavanaugh you're gonna find it in pictures with Hillary Clinton and\nA lot of lot of a powerful now powerful female actresses in Hollywood who looked at the other way long after they were just starting out long after they were helping very powerful and very wealthy but let's remember\nHow who got this all started let's remember he's facing criminal charges he's facing criminal charges and doesn't earn women describing kind of ...\nAll right this was a a moment yesterday on\nMSNBC a network that I literally don't even watch anymore because it's so pretty interesting so predictable but this was Mika Brzezinski are reacting to uh your comment that Dr Ford look she was not treated badly she was treated like a ... a ... was in America\n... egg and tell your story because he say women

very convenient to drop that but I Want to know your story I Want to know what happened you should have justice Rome certain hold on I'm not done all\nKnow you're ... you know okay you can't just throw that out as a political dagger to protect this reprehensible predator of a president\nReaction to that\nI have to reaction to that not I think that many people generally has made my point for me that people are judged women are judged by of what their grief or their harm or their recourse\nOr their quote victimhood based on their politics and I think many people are making the point for me but I don't dignify many things out there are because they're they're wholly irrelevant and I will tell you a lot of blowback yesterday a lot of pushback and a lot of blowback\nUm and I'll I'll have my say about that at some other time but at the moment I think it's completely irrelevant given how how high the stakes are Lauren\nUh to get justice Kavanaugh confirmed and as an associate justice in United States Supreme Court but it won't be bullied I won't be bullied either and I I won't be bullied um and I I'll have my say I'm not going to say much else right now that I find it to be\nOn basically are relevant and when I talked about the ... which by the way it is trending on social media I Love I Love informing generations that of a new term that may not know it uh but when I was

they if you let them do it to you got yourself to blame 'em by my to my mind\nWhat's happened here in part and only in part was directed personally at Kavanaugh\n... my my take on it is about the overarching purpose of this\nIs the interim effect but it creates or conservatives and maybe not just conservatives but anybody who doesn't\nI'm told a line of the new empowered progressive Democrats basically they are telling you that if you try to crash your party this was the kind of thing we're going to do to you and I think the only way to combat that\nIs to fight it aggressively and make sure the people who pulled that are apt to be held to account\nYou keep doing it to us there won't be any us left because no good people will want to get into politics\nAnd I I really mean it's not just someone from coming from someone who supported the president in the campaign but coming from a lawyer and a longtime conservative like myself I really believe Trump taught the Republicans how to fight\nIs thinking of simple formulation but for a long time Republicans were just taking it and they were afraid they were all just like they were all sleek in an elevator any longer I've never seen Mitch McConnell fight harder than he fought for this nomination\nIt well I think he's showing Trump is showing that this is what people have one at all along and look at this sometimes the ... the president I think goes way overboard and makes me cringe but if I go into my head if I have to pick\nI Want somebody who's going to fight than somebody who's not and if that means is going to be accessed from time to time then you know then there's going to be accessed from time to time\nBut I think he's showing that there's a hunger on our side to not just stand in a defensive crouch and keep taking this stuff with which we've been doing for years\nWell I think it's important that we have McConnell out their Lindsey Graham John Cornyn or even been fast talking about the mob mentality that we can't become a ... a country by mob rule where people are afraid to go to restaurants ...\nYeah and I and I think Laura that if you don't raise the stuff\nAnd turn it into an issue particularly one more on the cusp of an election\nYou don't have a compelling way after the election to say that you know this was on the table for people to consider and you have a mandate now to stop it because people voted against it so I think this is not only has to be fought but it has to be paid\nA as an election issue and frankly it helps the Republicans to tear up because\nI I've seen you say this what are you know on television and heard you on the radio said a million times\nOrdinary people commonsense people do not like the stuff I mean they see these these Olin ski I direct action tactics and they say you know there's some parts of this\nAgenda that I may agree with but these tactics are not America and and I don't think that's the American anybody wants who sensible\nNow and again people like Feinstein who looks either liberal but she was fairly well respected\nUntil I think the last you know a couple of years where she's been especially the last year

overlooking the boats yes go ahead sorry go ahead and to\nYou know I Would just have to ask a smart\nPolitical people is there someone that we can get done before the midterms and if there's not been I think you have to double down on Kavanaugh on say you know if if you vote Republican and we get we get a a majority in the Senate or then we're going to nominate\nCan a cabin all over again you know

... that you know he's a legal eagle he's always law you know constitutional law\nBut you you know you can be a political a political consultant if you want and actually be a good one handy because that's exactly it just like what they should have done with Obamacare Mitt Romney remember when he announced the Obamacare is a law passed\nIn twenty twelve Romney kind of just dropped it after he did his soap box a thing on the hardware store like one of his eye sockets they just drive to take it out\nAcross the country and said it's going to destroy your health care and that would have been a great issue for him it into this is a this is a great issue for the Republican\nYeah well I'm going to go from the who to call in east wouldn't say a man's got to know was limitation [noise] um

dynastic approach to it you know to the Senate and\nThe house of representatives I I remember her father I mean and then she when she becomes a big liberal so I don't get that at all I never I never

[noise] I'm of\nThe truck is probably worth about Fifteen my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell it for about ten\nOkay 'cause one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value\nOK okay you're not violating that though so we're good on the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\n[noise] um about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much debt other than the eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage or we have about Ninety thousand\nOkay but rather than include the car the car you know to do and what is the Ninety thousand on\nMostly student loans or we have some tax stuff um medical bills\nOkay so can you pay off forty five year making one forty and be dead free in two years my answer would be yes\nYes and um that would mean that if you want to keep her car there's nothing out of line with keeping it but just right at all so I mean we're not going to keep the dad a regardless of the interest rate we're just going to get rid of it but you know so but if you told me you owe thirty thousand dollars on her car and I would sell it in a heartbeat\nAre you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nI just know first of all thanks for taking my call and good luck to you for like\nOr should regard in retirement and college climbing from my one year old mhm\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby step for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash [laughter] um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on [laughter] I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I'd probably Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have no equity can it\nUm and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um so I'm going to be putting that into a check five twenty nine I think ah for him in any kind of\nPicking out some close stock mutual fund\nTo see where it goes from there okay um so my question is\nWhat are kind of my what do I do with this kind of piled cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses for\nFor um you know every any given mom because about twenty seven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter] um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then\nKind of want to know what to do with the rats should shy through it towards my how little that every year or\nShould I put it someplace else\nWe teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps that tells you what to do at different phases of your financial bland and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial planet tells you each time what to do and what to do first what's new second and so forth\nSo I'm baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund\nOf three to six months of expenses um that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so uh twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate\nAs adjusted emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n[noise] um so I'm about Seventy eight year\nAs the household income yeah okay All right and uh do you have a four one K. at work you know\nI have a I had a pension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it I'm Sorry I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well\nI'll tell you that mandatory\nOkay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I had very I currently has just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man which is one of kind of the the rubble and I hunters\nMe I'm familiar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a I'm a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo are coming there they're they're doing pretty good but none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time in her life so that those things evolve to the point that they're probably gonna be a good thing to do with some or you know in certain situations and so forth but\nOn the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the investing business so I don't care what you do okay I don't affect my income at all but people have always asked me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you you and your argument you you're married\nWe got married um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each\nUnless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred as eleven thousand and that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds I spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stock mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a force in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international\nNow once you're doing that and you have the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with you've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it and mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and so you have you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that that's maybe step three is ... by babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different in in you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and in what you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget uh\nAny extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr which you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I'll find and my budget almost keep jumping around that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you doing sir better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have are currently two hundred and twenty three thousand in that a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty normal currently with a U.S department of treasury um it as a result of having been a disgruntled from a service academy or three years ago\nUm and the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I'll do for a while um should I continue\nPaying off as small as that first or should I I'm a just a start to save rapidly the hundred Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know that that will eventually end up any collections account if\nI'm not able to pay the amount of people um\nYeah um and what is your income now\n\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred ... a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year although\nWow so you learn to you guys are the only guy on the side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three in the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can get who got wonderful income you'll be dead for two years\nFor someone to thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou're gonna get a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nOr so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance owing junior year they're either at the surge through in the service or you're assigned to the recruitment and um and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it it it it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enroll for a period of time and has forgiven or\nA yes or harbor my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something\nWell the only good news and this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that\nAren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dog ...\nHave to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new it finds them for you it's powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes identifies people with the right skills education and experience for your job and actively\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January took myself yeah I'm a checking account because\nHardware e boyfriend got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs yeah well we know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I rest\nMy case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life and make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independence from mom of eventually but if you can get her ... I\nDon't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual but to do that too I like run yeah I've been out but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again\nBut you like going to see last time not because she was healthy but because she was on healthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running and healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but if she does she go hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again borrow cooking you know and and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen a in numerous number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nThem now she only the Medicaid but she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want him just in a in a fall the rest of their life\nIs I mean they add controlled or she has a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen uh as as as early mentally ill and he is voices if she's not on a couple of different minutes she does\nWell her ... her only shot then as what we're talking about but our goal is for this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nYeah and it happens to people all the time but what\nDoes she say right now when they call her\nAnd then also you get nothing\nSo she does take up the phone\nYou know you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you're just a you know because they're going to just I don't\nThink I should be talking she should be telling them to\nBe either one of the American long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing because all they're doing his badge or her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we started\nI think they got it on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate and I are going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months old ... they're going\nPliable today but she's got no money and you're not given or any no so they get nothing\nNothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof and give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people go collectors\nAnd let's say I mean she'll she'll I'm a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight hundred there hey look at can we work at a deal yeah or you know they\nGot Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years from now back up and work and again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that the settlement and full will do it and get them in writing and no electronic access to your checking account because whatever these collectors sites you can tell they're lying if they're malnourished moving it's a filthy industry\nSo you got to treat them like rattlesnakes because they are they got to really tender\nRattlesnake soon after she starts making some money you got\nEmotionally on there so you can you can give her the cheerleading ... days without\nMoney and I think here to rise to

I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying all on paying all his bills he still has about I'm K. left on the equity loan ... thousand on a credit card mhm eight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the edge\n[noise] I'm putting everything\nWas a turning out to do everything on on that much money does that amount to what is it\n\nA month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nIf any aid on the car eight on the house and she didn't want to credit card\nOkay All right and it ... you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done in a year okay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're\nDone with a dead or you're right it rankles get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they're still working at a steel plant that I understand that right yes I was going to come a moment and it'll come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid of my prayer is at least that he gets through this year and that way your debt free and if he's a hundred percent that free house and everything and probably make it on a Social Security he had to write okay mom yeah not ideal not what we\nUh then the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get dead free then let's build an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses where we get past that and then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement is to clear that debt and to have that emergency fund and blood\nAnd he is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds gay and gay then why a bank [laughter] and now I'm [laughter] I'm someone at Harris H. B. K. and uh you know four and a and B paid off in twenty forty three and knowing that\nHe wasn't that long\nWhen two reasons one is they're stupid and the second reason is\nCounting on the house I've got a lien against the house right\nNow that you know and so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the question is is\nYou know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry I mean they'll they'll loan anybody does worry that are not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nLending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nOn ... inside of the industry is just stupid as what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it's like no they would've offered the dog that credit card\nSo I mean in dead people get credit card offers so you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card offers it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just be you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how are you\nOn the umpires have I got to require retirement are you OK\nI'm here about a year ... and I'm a ... century and I don't have a four one K. off pretty good mhm\nI quickly there or if it to be better to file for Social Security and law before it goes there for ... for ... for the whole time and they ...\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's why you're comparing it to say words if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it will you know what is the rate of return\nYou know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes of you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it [noise] um\nBy not taking out your four one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to get earlier\nUh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh definitely [laughter]\nYeah so you got to kind of gas and you've got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.

drive [noise] I think\nI'm getting old because I'm getting more and more ...\nI was thinking this morning about the neighborhood I grew up in\nAnd you know as you get older you don't remember the bad stuff all your does remember the good stuff and so it's very I'd be like in your mind it was an audio neighborhood it was incredible ... full of kids and we were always doing something you ever get a ... a piece of plywood out and put a couple of bricks\nA naval you're jumping and it didn't go well and you go over the handlebars I mean have you ever done stuff like that and we'd anymore how much\nI mean we play baseball we play football we spent a lot of time arguing about the call\n'cause we wait what all they argue about whether somebody is out of bounds we played and played and played and played and played run in and out of each other's houses and one mom always had some lemonade one mom would always have some\nBaloney sandwiches I mean it was a great neighborhood and I remember being a little kid\nSome of the kids I played with started going to school I thought man I Want to go to school it'll be cool to go to school when I can go to school I'll be happy than ever thought that and and then I got to go to kindergarten and I thought man next year\nI'll be in a grade with a number on it\nI'll be happy then they teach you to read in the first grade I'll be happy then and when back when I went to school and I don't know where you go to school but I mean we had one through six was elementary school\nAnd and so you know you're about a second grader and all the sixth graders there the king of the hill right they own the school right and so you're like man\nIf I could just get in the sixth grade I'd be like the big dog on campus I'd be in charge I'd be I'd be ruin the school man I'll be happy then\nThen you finally get the sixth grade and you know what you look over there and we had what we called junior high school or middle school which was seven eight nine school I went to and I thought man\nIf I could just get out of six ... middle school you know they've got I got paid the they've got football they got cheerleaders\nCheerleaders they guy lockers man I if I could get over to middle school I'd be happy then you remember\nAnd that was in middle school I got to be about the ninth grade and I was fourteen Fifteen Years old and one of my buddies got his driver's license\nAnd oh man if I could just get my driver's license I'd be free I could drive myself to McDonald's and we go through McDonald's I'll tell you how long ago it was we would go through the McDonald's drive through and we can get a Big Mac and a small coke for a buck sixteen\nThat time and since then our income has gone\nDown and we added another child and we've gotten into San credit card debt and we have a car loan now um\nWe can take the money out they'll have invested over the past three years without penalty to do that or should we pay off our debt and leave that money and continue contributing to their prepaid plan how much is in there [noise]\nUm about eighty six hundred\nEighty six hundred dollars and how much do you own your car we have a ten thousand and one of your on your credit cards all five thousand okay and um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nWe just started ... and that's and I realized that we did that baby steps out of order with having pizza pan pre played pan and then and then I don't know what to do at this point\nGotcha okay I'm In your household income as well [noise]\nUm I had the next twenty five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand over to our um no I Would not cash would\nStop adding to it um\nAnd um you do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning in financial ... University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to it you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a new emergency\nAh no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of their enroll it into a five twenty nine\nPlan in good mutual funds and here's why you're much better off to save for college in a five twenty nine or an ESL and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plants here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so if I ... a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of an increase in price 'cause that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an increased rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing\nNow tuition for the last Seventy years as average about seven point two percent inflation right\nSo that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent average annual return over that same period of time minded\nAnd so you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is a ... and it's a blanket statement but and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness\nGovernment are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans in the process I mean they're just horrible administrators mess\nSo in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration with a with the stability of the fun of still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say a roll your eighty six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned to call to vacation because you're broken you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt\nSo you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas hey Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent uh want to thank you for ... for a a help\nI was going through after you for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for you and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ...\nTo my question because this is a wonderful thing that sticks to happen or we were my family my parents have received an inheritance a mineral rights in West Texas a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oils but not not a time [laughter] ah speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell and cash out or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom and we want them out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly mhm\n[noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual uh oil prices that sustain a drilling a and and that's one reason is west Texas is struggling run our oil prices are so far down that there's no boom\nOkay I mean when the gas for five dollars a gallon or the boom by her main\nBut are you doing and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue all of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all they get just about everything I Know just in\nA [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have\nTo sell all of them you have to sell all into little or none no it's not an all or none or what you it's it's simply a they're looking at the three million for all\nThe and the or you know obviously one point five for half okay so you're just and on ... yeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah I mean we're not oil people\nYeah I think I don't think I'm asking is is what I mean I'm ... so you're only talking about selling our house\n[noise] we're deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table this debris million dollars on it when I go by oil rights within my answer would quickly be no\nMainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that okay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable in less risk personally okay\nAbout the middle kitchen type ... go by what rights in West Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell for the same reason I was doing you know that you wouldn't know why and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with is getting the family to understand the you know lower afraid the stock market crash yeah well it might\nBut I can start cameras rock markets less risk than growing holes were hundred percent sure that you know I I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be all person to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just felt like yours off\n[noise] uh no this is I'm I'm helping my mother and father mecca to such oh I see so it was a just a day and they can make the decision for the whole thing or not yeah\nAren't than if I were in their shoes I Would at least to sell Seventy five percent of it\nI probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they are just dying to be a little bit and they're all business and they're scared to death so phone ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh I don't really know so that that\nYou know be struck out right after I sold it I regretted the rest of my life you know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that\nFamilies entire portfolio\nThree million dollar network because of um\nPersonally if somebody asked me as a financial coach as I Do that I Would say no\nThis is the ...\n\n\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of it there are a ball they\nNever live up to the expectations

get a condo over Knoxville and one of the ball game over there and he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out\nSo three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more stuff more repairman you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big term investment that you get rich on then you'll be fine\nJamie is with us Jamie is in Alexandria, Louisiana

have a thousand less so that's not bad\nBut your your take home pay three thousand us thirty six thousand a year so that means you're probably making about forty five thousand before taxes as I don't write\nIncome at age ... is a thousand in something they'll find them on with a I make my twenty two hundred a month from my job and I get about nine Ninety two inches off a point about three thousand now in income\nOr a little over three okay I'm In a well you don't have a lot of wiggle room heroes and two boys um ... but let's just let's stop a second because it sounds like you're paying bills

I think they're going to find that this was clearly a democratic yet and drag\nEven George if I saw something like that I probably never gone another person's how\nWell you went to a lot of funeral homes sometimes as an invited guest because you could see the ... the person who died\nRight and that's what I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that so many people want to talk to their loved ones for the last time\nI used the deceased always near their cash skipped during a funeral or or or are they is\nNormally yes standing at the foot of the cast it because that's usually where the ... family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects\nAnd so anything that said they can hear because they're very very nosy and as to what people are saying about them or how they look or you know they they like to know that stuff and but in the last\nSeven or eight years this business where there's tables set off to the side with all these photos and their life in pictures\nAnd if there's a group of people standing around by those pictures then despair will go over there and listen to what they're saying and it's funny because I've already been there where a man said that lady with that had on over there I said yep\nHe said well she's saying that that picture happened when we were in Missouri she's out or her mind we weren't in Missouri when that happened\nWe were in Pennsylvania and it's like okay no I'm not going to go argue with your lady friend over there\nGoes on is very interesting usually well it has to be an immediate family member that invites me you just can't believe how many nosy neighbors there yeah I ... at any rate I go to this ... this particular funeral the man was standing at the foot of his casket\nAnd he looked at me he said you can see me I said I can and I told them what was and he said I bet my daughter phones you she would find somebody crazy like you\nAnd I'm thinking okay and so I said well I said yes your daughter did call me and he says I got my son doesn't know anything about this\nAnd I said to the cause the daughter I said does your brother you called me she says oh yeah he's really into this\nAnd I just started to look to your father gave him aside and so he said will call my son over half recall my son over\nSo he says to me tell my son to go home right now that my brother bill is in my basement trying to break open my gun cabinet oh boy and I looked at him and I said now you're telling a crazy person that I mean you know he called me crazy\nWas it was the brother going to try to do so man or woman was just wanted the collection of gun role he wanted to just keep 'em for a meal right\nSo I said to the sun I said your uncle bill is in your dad's house right now in the basement trying to break open the gun cabinet\nAnd the sun looks at me he goes he's not I just saw a half hour ago and I said point them out to me\nHe's lucky he says you know I don't really see him I Am the father said my house is two streets over I says apparently your father's house is only two streets over and he learned to do this to her and she said I didn't tell her\nAnd I said please go home and go down the basement and see what your uncle's doing\nOh sure enough that's wrong well bill was breaking open the gum Kim and I'm right on ...\nSo it it's interesting when things like that happened or were they told me where money's kitten or a I Can't tell you how many gifts I found for wives that the husbands died right before

don't know they're dead but\nI mean the middle of that you don't know how do you not know what you would I Would agree with you yeah I Know you can do\nThis no I'm not saying they're happy about it but ... we know that they're dead\nYou know not everybody who dies moves on thinking this is all fun and games ha ha I'm dead and I'm going to happen and how to be depressing even for some of the uh ... deceased I Would guess\nWell it's it's a lot of them are sad because they think that they will\nIn children grow up and it's like no no no\nNo no one to go into the light you can come back and

pretty easy\nAnd you hate to put this out there but I it's actually pretty easy to put negative energy on somebody it's not as big of a ritual as people think it is I mean if you think about it you don't care for your neighbor and every day you know what are you fighting about you're fighting about the property line\nSo every day when you see him come out of his house and go in his garage to leave or cut his grass you're sitting there in your kitchen watching him going oh you jerk I Hope you break your knee or\nI don't know like you why don't you move you know look at it this way if I said to you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock I'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for me I Will say a prayer for you\nExactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen every time she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't that didn't\nKnow that person one realize this is happening to them and to fight it off\n[noise] they can eventually but remember comma you know be careful who you credit for a while under the bus it you never know what\nGoes around comes around that's true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI think if it's done with enough intent or if you actually go to someone for his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody they pretty much know easily\nThe three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one to all three of them and and no particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problems dating and you always had a good time\nAnd all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person after the second day to your show right down the toilet so something's going on but if you know if you go to somebody like me or you look at my one book that he has the instructions and remove negative energy\nOnce that's taken off because and anybody can remove negative energy off of somebody you can't do it to yourself\nBut you can definitely have a friend do it and once that is released in gone you're fine the same thing with health if a person has a curse on them and they've got\nA bad health problem and you go to the doctor you go for an MRI you go for the peace and you have blood work done the doctor goes no\nEverything is normal there's nothing wrong with you we can't find anything\nBut gosh if you have a curse than you are negative energy I knew\nIs

like I said it you know what nobody has to live like that you don't have to be a martyr do something about it had it removed it's not hard to do you can do it\nAnd it is long and you know ... actually a person doesn't even believe they have a curse than I Am and I tell them that they do\nIt down in front of me I'll take this off of you they don't even have to believe that all they have to do is give me their permission\nMy grand daughter got a promotion where she was working and apparently she got a promotion over somebody who thought they were entitled to that job and she did it fair and square you know decent and everything she's bright girl\nAnd but strange things started happening to her I mean things that would always go well\nThings were really kinda screwed up\nAnd she called me up one day and said papa ... I think somebody put a curse on me and and I said ... let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you I mean you're in good fun person you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over\nAnd I want a hostage and I said of a couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes and sure enough it ended up being the person who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nBut stop sending negative energy to hurry to go that far off right exactly\nSo my question is when someone does get hit by a curse mhm how easy is\nWho put the curse on them\nFor a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is um [noise]\nDid you take somebody away from their spouse in other words that you have an affair with a married person believe you me a woman you know ... ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody\nWouldn't meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens and but\nThe bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself you have to call Murray and when ... how do you get at all\nNo you can't remove yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and again they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and and when go speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nIs every buddy susceptible to a curse what about someone who's got so much energy and positivity can they put up this for ... for you to kind of block it and she you\nKnow unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that may be has to be do something on every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were first\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed most people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have\nA curse removed off of them again it does not affect\nThem as a matter of fact I think about it ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's a game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York\nAnd so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time they're ... gets up the whole stadium is going oh leave huge or don't hit the ball in and out and then they clap as he does its negative energy thrown on that person's\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the home she has an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their playing to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's gonna be added on every all their stadium that is not his home state yeah\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of ballplayers\nHer ballplayers in a slump let's say in the early\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too it's especially ball players\nLook the dead fans that goes that hang out stadiums you know you couldn't walk up and stand next to LeBron James and a basketball game you would never get on court the guards and everybody would\nKeep you away but gee if your ghost who's going to stop you know exactly\nWhat about the dream state visiting the dead and for other things\nOne person has crossed into\nIf your dreams you can talk to them you can get all kinds of information from them you can get a hug\nA kid I mean it is so comforting to be able to talk to these people they look good they look at the uh happy they look healthy and bought if the person has not crossed over you will never dream of them earth bounce spirits cannot get dream\nNow is an earth bounce spirit is in your bedroom while you're sleeping you're going to him as our dreams technicolor loan flashy um we're wakes you up and you're breathing hard but that goes was not in your dreams\nWhere was Mary and wouldn't tell your website is her name linked up the coast to coast am dot com she's also pretty prolific author with books including Ghost World one ghosts be beyond delicious the ghost whispers cookbook she was a consultant on that TV show that was fun I remember those days used to talk with me about\nAt W.

so ago and he said they were than negative energy in my house and I wanted to know anticipating one finger disaster after another\nAnd ... anything that I suggested you did not do\nYou know we have the same\nThey sound like they're in the background whatever they might be\nWhy or how many how often did you much\nFor one million\nWell smoking works and it really does help get rid of negative energy\nBlamed smart gene Merriam excuse me explain what ...\nIs actually what Native American Indians used it said you're sweet grass\nAnd it's a bundle that light in your blowout and you go around the perimeter of every room in the house with the smoke and if there is go sit in the house that will make them very lethargic laid back it makes a huge difference you will see a difference in the duty not retaliate\nOr its negative energy is in the house it will help dissipated but the problem is one says and then you've got to do it especially if it goes in the house you've got to do it at least\nEvery two weeks and you have to get the smoke everywhere because the one place you don't get the smoke is where they're going to be hiding\nBut if you've had but the lady from Cincinnati hopefully you hit a minister or\nA priest come in and blessed the house that makes a huge difference and much more than one because the negative energy was pretty strong and one time is not going to

been able to track the terrible\nUh Thirteen Ninety I Believe is the earliest evidence uh fourteen twenty is the first full deck that we know about in the Italian Renaissance but no one knows who the first designer was actually\nIn I I really like that and I think it's part of what tarot is ultimately it's it comes from the human imagination\nMaybe it was given to us from above song or from above\nAnd lo or within and you know I'm a union psychologist so ah we've then is to place that I look\nLet's explain to her all the people who probably knew what it looks like but they might not know

which came first the playing cards at the terrible cards and actually\nIf you think of a standard set of playing cards that is equivalent roughly to what's called\nThe minor our corner of the ...\nThe child has an additional twenty two cards\nThat is called the major are coming up and these are the cards um that people commonly uh think of when they think of Cairo cards you know they have they have the magician\nRyan old card a fool and\nWheel of fortune and things like that\nAnd deaths your favorite car George yes it is [laughter] favorite because I'm fascinated by it I Know\nI Know you are and it is it is an extremely a beautiful cards the card them as it is the devil card and the tower ... usually three cards which people think are the most\nUh uncomfortable course of the major are coming up but every court in the tower deck has a positive and negative aspect\nUm and the modern tarot which is really my forte um has really moved since uh you know ... it became very a cult oriented in the\nUh nineteenth and a early twentieth century England with the\nSociety of the Golden Dawn and that's where the modern tarot are really was birds with the you know wait jak or the Arthur wait ... the writer weight tomorrow and what what uh what happened then was very exciting in the world of terror out in that [noise]\nFor the first time the minor are con which are like playing cards a deck of playing cards each one of the tips or the miners were finally illustrated with rich\nDynamic pictures that tell a story before that time\nOnly the majors only the the pardon the expression Trump\nCard ... uh where we're going to talk about that yes on the right\nBut I'm\nOnly those had pictures that you could actually just look at directly and\nUh get an impression of him and kind of just coming to the sense of what was going on there the miners before or the twentieth century um his head geometric design so if they're forced suits you know like my heart's clubs diamonds and what's the other one\nA page right those are equivalent to the Cairo the terrorists suits of a\nCups or tentacles\nAll of those minor cards she's had geometric shapes on them so if it was a seven of cops\nThere would be a just a picture of seven challenges on it say and that's all you had to go by now there is in a very rich and dynamic image that goes with the meaning of that card and\nUm there are probably six or seven hundred ... a new and different tarot deck today out on the market\nBut they all pretty much followed this the basic Cairo convention so that it doesn't really matter which jak you're using and some are very out there even my deck is pretty out there\nYou rode the nine yeah you came up with your own new\nYes correct um but it's the same architect\nSo you know a card is in the car has an

I worked with him for a number of years she helped shape my career years later he went on to ... became a professor he got his PHD taught to journalism to a number of younger people simply loved it it'd be a great guy\nShield lover did at the age of Seventy nine usually an outbreak\nOf fleet born type ... downtown Los Angeles health officials say they're investigating several cases of the fleet born at type is a disease that infected fleas can spread to humans that while the fleas can come from cats rats possums pets\nAnd in people however typist can cause high fever chills headache and rash it is not transmitted from person to person and can be treated with antibiotics but a big problem in LA\nInternet connected devices like routers and smart home gadgets are typically low hanging fruit for hackers that's because most step simplistic security systems like all being outfitted with the same password was leaving the factory or having no password at all\nAlthough new California law would make it legal to manufacture or sell Internet connected devices that are not equipped with a very unique password when that devices first huge it'll take effect January first twenty twenty\nSenator Susan Collins Republican out of Maine and Joe Manchin the Democrat out of West Virginia\nSay they intend to vote in favor Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation two crucial boats that appear to secure Kavanaugh's confirmation to the nation's highest court they will vote tomorrow doctor John Curtis online columnist dot com with us well let's close John very close\n... close to the final analysis nobody you know the FBI and you know the Senate We're not really interested in ... uh you know drinking habits as an undergraduate or to high school where\nI mean that's what the Democrats were trying to do this really what it comes down to you it's one of the biggest squads by any political party every ... done drag this poor guy through the mud over absolutely nothing\nA bet with and and I think if they investigate all ... I think they're going to find that this was clearly a democratic\nEven George if I saw something like that I probably never gone another person's\nHouse well you went to a lot of funeral homes sometimes as an invited guest because you could see the ... the person who died\nRight and that's what I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that so many people want to talk to their loved one for the last time\nI used the deceased always near their cash skipped during a funeral or are they is\nNormally yes standing at the foot of the cast it because that's usually where the ... family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects\nAnd so anything that said they can hear because they're very very nosy and as to what people are saying about them or how they look or you know they they like to know that stuff and but in the last seven\nOr eight years this business where there's tables set off to the side with all these photos and their life in pictures\nAnd if there's a group of people standing around by those pictures then despair will go over there and listen to what they're saying and it's funny because I've already been there where a man said that lady with that had on over there I said yep\nHe said well she's saying that that picture happened when we were in Missouri she's out or her mind we weren't in Missouri when that happened we were in Pennsylvania and it's like okay no I'm not going to go argue with your ...\nInterested in what goes on is very interesting usually well it has to be an immediate family member that invites me you just can't believe how many nosy neighbors there are yeah I live at any rate I go to this ... this particular funeral the man was standing at the foot of his casket\nAnd he looked at me he said you could see me I said I can and I told them what was and he said I bet my daughter found shoe she would find somebody crazy like you\nAnd I'm thinking okay and so I said well I said yes your daughter did call me and he says I got my son doesn't know anything about this and I said to the to the daughter I said does your brother in law you called me she says oh yeah he's really into this\nI just started to look to your father and gave him aside and so he said will call my son over half recall my son over so he says to me tell my son to go home right now that my brother bill is in my basement trying to break open my gun\nCabinet oh boy and I\nLooked at him and I said now you're telling a crazy person that I mean you know he called me crazy\nWas is was the brother going to try to do and show fan or what was really just wanted the collection of guns do you want to keep them from Salem\nRight so I said to the sun I said your uncle bill is in your dad's house right now in the basement trying to break open the gun cabinet\nAnd the sun looks at me he goes he's not I just saw a half hour ago and I said point them out to me\nHe's lucky he says you know I don't really see him I Am the father said my house is two streets over I says apparently your father's house is only two streets over\nAnd he learned it as a stir and she said I didn't tell her and I said please go home and go down the basement and see what your uncle doing\nOh sure enough this wrong bill was breaking open the gum cabinet right on them so it it's interesting when things like that happened or were they told me where money's kitten or a I Can't tell you how many gifts I've found for wives\nThat the husbands died right before their birthday or an anniversary and you know it's like look in this covered in his shoe box you gonna find a really pretty necklace that he's out for you you\nYou give them closure\nI Do I Do it if you think about it you know\nIt would have been really nice to talk to a couple of your loved ones before you couldn't do it anymore and I think people like that and it's not always wears the key to the safety deposit box a lot of times it is but not all the time\nWhen a when you're dealing with the deceased how many of them are generally know but their debt\nEvery one of them how\nDo you not come out of your body and look down in ... leads the body and look down and go holy smokes I Am dead\nSo they're not in denial\nThey are not and I know there's some psychic send me the and said that they don't know they're dead but I mean\nThe middle of that you don't [noise] how do you not know what you would I Would agree with you yeah I Know you can do\nThis now I'm not saying they're happy about it but that doesn't really know that they're dead\nYou know not everybody who dies moves on thinking this is all fun and games are ... and I'm going to happen and how to be depressing even for some of the uh ... deceased I Would guess\nWell it's it's a lot of them are sad because they think\nFamily or watch their grandchildren grow up\nAnd it's like no no no no no once you go into the light you can come back and forth you're not gonna miss anything plus the fact there's proof of that\nBecause if you take pictures and you get or herbs and pictures\nPerfectly round circles they can be little they can be big they can be any color they can be sparkly though there's fears that have crossed over back for a visit if there's a design in the middle of the or enlarge it you can usually CSI profile or a face of who it is\nIf the orb is blank in the middle is the dust particle don't worry about it\nYou have looked a lot of negative energy persons what have you concluded about\nThough [noise] well I really believe it's pretty easy and you hate to put this out there but I it's actually pretty easy to put negative energy on somebody it's not as big of a ritual as people think it is\nI mean if you think about it you don't care for your neighbor and every day you know what are you fighting about you're fighting about the property line\nSo every day when you see him come out of his house and go in his garage to leave or cut its grass you're sitting there in your kitchen watching him going oh you jerk I Hope you break your knee or\nI don't like you why don't you move you know look at it this way if I said to you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock I'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for me I Will say a prayer for\nExactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen Everytime she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't that didn't\nKnow that person one realize this is happening to them and to fight it off\n[noise] can eventually but remember comma you know be careful who you credit for a longer the bar is you never know what\nGoes around comes that's true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI think if it's done with enough intent or if you actually go to someone for his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody they pretty much know would easily\nThe three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one to all three of them and and no particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problems dating and you always had a good time\nAnd all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person after the second day to your show right down the toilet so something's going on but if you you know if you go to somebody like me or you look at my one book that he has the instructions and remove negative energy\nOnce that's taken off and anybody can remove negative energy off of somebody you can't do it to yourself\nBut you can definitely have a friend do it\nAnd once that is released in gone you're fine the same thing with health if a person has a curse on them and they've got a bad health problem and you go to the doctor you go for an MRI you go for the peace and you have blood work done the doctor goes no\nEverything is normal there's nothing wrong with you we can't find anything but gosh if you have a person you are

I think somebody put a curse on me and and I said Ari let's let's think about this for a moment who would want to do this to you I mean you're in good fun person you were a nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over\nAnd I want a Hamas and I said of a couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes and sure enough it ended up being the person who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nBut stop sending negative energy to hurry you go that far off right and\nHe was so my question is when someone does get hit by a curse mhm how easy is it\nWho put the curse on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is\nUm [noise] did you take somebody away from their spouse\nIn other words that you have an affair with a married person believe you me a woman you know ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody wouldn't meaner than men she's gonna curse that person\nAnd because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens\nAnd but the bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself you have to call ... ... how do you get at all\nNo you can't remove yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and again they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and and when do speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nIs every buddy susceptible to a curse word about someone who's got so much energy and positivity can they put up the force you to kind of block it and she you\nKnow unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the cruises removed\nThat doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that may be has to be do something it on every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were first\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed most people as long as the you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have\nA curse removed off of them again it does not affect them as a matter of fact I think about it ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's a game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York\nAnd so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time there best hitter gets up the whole stadium is going to lose you jerk don't hit the ball get an out and then they clap as he does its negative energy thrown on that person's\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the home she has an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their playing to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's gonna be added on every all their stadium that is not his home state yeah\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of ballplayers will\nHer ballplayers in a slump let's say you really\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too it's especially ballplayers\nLook the dead fans that goes that hang out stadiums\nYou know you couldn't walk up and stand next to LeBron James and a basketball game you would never get on court the guards and everybody would keep you away sure but gee if your ghost who's going to stop you know exactly\nWhat about the dream state visiting the dead and for other things\nOne person has crossed into ...\nOut of your dreams you can talk to them you can get all kinds of information from them you can get a hard\nOn kids I mean it is so comforting to be able to talk to these people they

background whatever they might\nBe why or how many how often did you much\nFor one gun\nWell smoking more and it really does help get rid of negative energy\nBlamed smart gene Maryam excuse me explain what smart ...\nIs actually what Native American Indians used it said you're sweet grass and it's a bundle that light in your blowout and you go around the perimeter of every room in the house with the smoke\nAnd if there is go sit in the house that will make them very lethargic laid back it makes a huge difference you will see a difference in the duty not retaliate\nOr its negative energy is in the house it will help dissipated but the problem is one says you've got to do it especially if it goes in the house you've got to do it at least every two weeks\nAnd you have to get the smoke everywhere because the one place you don't get the smoke is where they're going to be hiding\nBut if you've had but the lady from Cincinnati hopefully you hit a minister or a priest come in and

was on the phone with us Mary and you could hear something like a ... sound in the background did you hear that\nI did and ... and she did\nNot have bad or I Would have told her about it when I talk

of the if you're with a regular company\nIt probably unless they go in and ... ... not going to work so easily because companies have to set up the abilities for money has to be taking the news for certain ways and one of the biggest things that I have seen their hospital workers out there\nIf you're a hospital worker and you're hearing my voice right now in this city\nYou need to call me because there's some things about your retirement plans that you don't\nKnow or if you do know that you can fix\nBecause there's some uh for example did you realize that if you're working in the hospital in this city most of the plans as long as you're working will not let you take withdrawing left his lack of the\nUh what's it called a hardship and then you might not be able to take more than five thousand dollars I drive you can borrow up to a five or ten thousand dollars ... on your own money paying interest on your own money which is not a whole lot of money when you're paying interest on it but\nI have nurses and folks all the time who are like in their sixties that cut down to like partial a retirement and they can't get a dollar out of their retirement at work because they have to be Seventy and I asked ... to get the money\nSo these are things that need correcting and Donald Trump's working on it so shame on you medical people out there that are setting that up and allow knows a financial\n... lizards to talk to you in the last name ah I'm not talking about your workers I'm Talking about you you are management people that are being deceived you all you got to say no you can't come into this whole endless you fix it where they can take their money out at least fifty nine and a half is just don't work and you\nUse reminded me I'm I'm uh my my grandfather Ninety seven years old first time he was ever in the hospital got kicked out that really took a turn off the nurse you know it was a\nI don't know how [laughter]\n... oh yeah yeah I I had to plug that in there because I've been having problems with that these nurses and bless their cells they when they retire they they don't have to they shouldn't have to completely stop their job because like greedy investment company\nHas a smoker that hospital uh-huh into allowing them\nTo sign a contract with them they are the forbidden to take their money out to the seven and a half their in their started so with these new four one K. benefits they're going to be more regulated and they'll they'll they can take money out these for all three babies they're not as regulated\nAnd these four fifty seven ... they're they're not as regulators so they they can paint them that way so there's a lot of things that we can do so if say like a student wanted to pay off their ah funds faster\nThey can use their four O. one K. to do this\nOr a good information good stuff to know because there's so many folks out there with student debt and it does not seem to be going away\nYou can call David artist

retirement program ... little I did a little chastising a little earlier before the break a\nMedical workers are being done wrong in this city because they should be able to take money I Wonder if it demand and a half or even though they're still employed if anyone is listening to this is a management person you can change that all you gotta do silly investment company to change that or get a you know what out ... and lives will be another when they will do it for you\nAnd I want to say right now I Know for the fact\nThat a child and you do too I'm sure in in the medical field right you know nurses work hard they sure do now when they went on that TV show what was it the view\n... odd just want to put my foot through the television talking about nurses didn't work hard and they were you know just a bunch of prima donnas but I Know that these are not been in the hospital yes and I know you know nurse comes in their spends ten minutes for me I'm not one not only one on that floor and she's got to look after\nAnd you know\nI'm a ...\nThese people deserve the respect of course their male nurses to right there ... there there were there taking care of folks and then not getting the appreciation and they they don't need this problem that you just mentioned well he's not just nurses\nYou got the laboratory people ... who who should have a lot more respect in you know\nIn the radiological paypal or you've got to physical therapy people you've got all the you got all these different aspects you you've got the transportation papal you got the pharmacy you know everybody works as a as a you know as a unit that drove the hospital or machine right\nAh but the fact is when you when when a when a hospital\nPuts together a retirement plan and they get snow covered and I'm going to use the word snow covered by the investment or people who come\nInto a a allowing a contract to sign that they can't take the money out when they're fifty nine and a half and maybe even though they're stealing board front is something wrong with that because a lot of people break down and they want to start working part time or they want to work\nOr somewhere else and keep that job a

work and your schedule of we're going to talk about how Larry came to meet me and and some of the ... is health conditions that lead up to his visit\nHow did you find out about me or how'd you find out about the Arab shop\nActually I had a a lady in my church who came to react church one Sunday when I was really doing bad and she had been to see you and you had helped her with so many different things and she said you really ought to go see him it can't hurt and so we made the trip and the rest is history\nYou know I I ah saint prayer request almost every day in emails and I'm post on different social media and I know our bodies are amazing uh amazingly made and I know that uh we have a lot of choices and we have a lot of choices of what makes us get sick\nOr that we may not be aware of and we have choices that can enable or fuel the body to get well\nWell and\nI agree with that like I've told you before I spent the last forty six years in ministry of thirty nine of those years is a pastor and I have seen the power prayer I experienced miracles personally I Know that God does amazing things but I also know that God works through individuals\nAnd he works to medical doctors any works through every other alternative kind of medicine that I've ever been a part of an all of my life and uh personally I think there's a place for all of it and I'm I'm happy to be a part of things now at our shop having experience which you had to offer to us\nWhere he's skeptical earlier today apprehensions are doing it seems like your family has some association with the vitamin sales well\nMy my wife's a family had been with GNC general nutrition Centers for like thirty five years I have been around\nHerbs and supplements or of you know as you can only imagine and I knew there was a lot going for in fact I have taken a lot of things through the years from GNC\nAnd a lot of it helped me to a great degree\nAnd it wasn't until this peripheral neuropathy began to take a hold on me that I realized that we were in in trouble needing to go in another direction and uh\nMy my family is now retired from GNC so it was great to to know that we had this option with herb shop to come home when that back up again\nOr you um said neuropathy but you had some other conditions that were also a prevailing I guess what was the climax where he said enough said enough\nIt boils down to where it was in the fall of two thousand Seventeen that my my family doctor after three or four years of intensively trying to find a solution and my physical problems are just looked at me one day and said from an AMA perspective I don't know what else to do\nAnd so we had we were trying everything imaginable and at that point ah my wife and I just we're looking at each other saying we've got to come up with a different alternative because everything we've tried at this point\nHas failed and and what uh I Know it could be emotional but what was your life like it that low point of health at that where\nPeople were coming to you offering suggestions of what to do what what what I mean it wasn't just like a head cold I mean it was that was pretty rough\nIt was it was rough because basically uh having been a pastor and I was still passed ring at the time\nAnd I uh I had got so weak\nI couldn't even stand up to preach on Sunday mornings I was sitting in a stool and was having to hold on because I was so weak physically\nAnd it was very very hard on me I I've always been a very active person and especially as a as a pastor a bad week we're sixty hours I normally work eighty hours a week and I just put my heart and soul into it and when you get to the place\nYou only have about two good hours a day and the rest of the time you're you're in bed it's really rough on you emotionally mentally to to realize I Am no longer able to do something that I've been doing for forty years\nThey are people describe this kind of not only of a pain but your arms and legs feel like they have lead weights or\nIs there was lead weights there was no one is a I mean I even got to the place where a by after news my legs were in such bad shape\nThat ah I I couldn't feel the pedals on my car to drive anymore and so I became even more and more dependent on my wife and on other people to do literally everything for me because I was losing total function all the way through\nAnd it was it because you weren't looking for answers you had been to multiple doctors for quite some time\nI I had been seriously going to doctors for nearly a decade\nOr you know a lot of neurologist I had been a rheumatologist I had gone to several different a general practitioners\nThat had been recommended that might have different options and there was a point that I I almost I I ... I felt like the the woman in the Bible with the blood disease who spent everything she had on doctors\nAnd there was nothing else from a human perspective that she could do an and I was at that point that there was nothing left from a human perspective that I could do and we were praying hard\nWell I Am glad I was part of that answer um but I was in the easiest thing to deal with it either I Know I have you are a big to do list or that a lot of the burden back on you I but I gave you answers I gave you choices and I think they made sense to you\nThey made sense because I I remember after those that first couple of visits and and you ran the test on me and you basically sat down with my wife and I and said this is where we're at this is what I see\nA we have major commitments that I Need from you as far as supplements are concerned and as well as a whole change in your your eating habits and if you're willing to do this for six months I think you'll see a change\nAnd I remember going back home and having long discussions with my wife and it's like I I just feel in my in my heart I Need to make a six month commitment to this and she goes I'm with you I said it's going\nAnd the whole family because everybody is going to have in one way or another commit to this to to make it a a joint effort so we made that first six months commitment and stuck to it and at times it was a challenge there is no doubt about it but looking back on it right now it was the best decision we made\nYou a little different than many patients I mean if you do have a lot of problems they came with yet a lot of different mode alleys but a characteristic Lee you had better records than many people I see you had a going back maybe Fifteen Years you knew how many ...\nAntibiotics you would take and you knew what a pain pills you would take him for which situation you knew what was in an injection and doctor gave you you had a very good medical records and it showed that you may have had momentary relieve\nFrom various situations a pill for an ill kind of scenario but you relapsed into a greater degenerative condition and actually had more conditions and symptoms front each time you reach that pivotal point where the doctor says this is the last thing we could try they try that\nI'm kind of fix in and lo and behold you're you're you're set back worse than you were before a and because of those records not only the notes and that the doctors took in the notes you had\nA you could see this this timeline and the way I work as I'm unlike an investigator I look at so many facets to a person's health\nA biochemistry the function of the by it doesn't work in isolation there's that you have to understand a lot of deep and broad picture of what's happening\nSomething as simple as the size and shape of a red blood cell and and your blood work you're MTV and our need to be a and M. C. H. the these are the ... the the the average red blood cells size and shape and thickness\nAnd they were at highs and lows of those variations well that tells me that you don't utilize\nHave floral Quinlan syndrome and so with nothing to lose I went online\nI began to search this condition and I found forty side effects\nThe flow acquainted loans and I wrote down that I had thirty five of them\nWell we do a ... and the Arabs shop genetic testing and I've had radio shows about the genetic testing that we with ear history as I mentioned earlier in your details and and understanding that a certain genetic tendencies wall let the floor Quinn alone kind of passed through with less harm it actually\nMakes the mitochondria kind of the power plant and your sale die or knowing from my lab that you're really low on phosphorus and that's one of the side effects of taking the prescribe neck see 'em\nThat you had these combinations of things that were leaning to this this kind of muscle dying disease I'm ... and I knew what the answer was from a supplement so I put it in your vote a call I didn't need to run more testing at and have you spend more money I guess I got you started on what would\nFeed the muscles and and start providing energy\nAnd and I think that was a big positive you know turn around in this because I\nYou know went putting all of this together and not only talking when you were talking with my family doctor before than they were concerned everyone's seen to be concerned about my family history you know where there are things going on in my in my past it might've been pre determining what was going on at this point and\nThat that's where I I was blessed\nBecause as a pastor I've pretty much had to file long form with the IRS every year so I had all my medical records\nAnd in fact for a forty years I was able to come up with every medical expense every doctor visited every medicine prescribed as well as records of test surgical procedures and everything else and so\nMy family doctor asked me to put this history together\nAnd when I finished it was about Thirteen pages long and he was totally blown away he'd never seen\nA history on an individual to that extent\nAnd and so I I I was excited to be able to present that to him to show him what was what was going on and given the details and to understand\nHow the floor oh Quinlan issue wasn't something that just started it actually went back to the early nineties when I had my first ah reactions to it and at the time no one ever caught that those problems were there and so I had\nNearly a thirty five year history of this building up in my body and continuing to do do the damage but\nIs these antibiotics that are like ... they're stronger often doctors will say that you may not have responded to a predictor infection with an antibiotic or that or they see that\nMaybe in your note said it took a stronger antibiotic of other things that also disabled mitochondria are are the cholesterol medication can do that too\nAnd I just know from knowing that that's what ...\nBut I think of ways to help them understand what the doctors doing what I'm doing and and you know if I'm like I just left to the store and had my son trying to fix a little a plumbing thing and I had all the tools I think are necessary except there were a ... a ... a particular ranch would've been better\nAnd he decided a hammer was better you know sometimes we grabbed the tool that we think we can just get by with\nAnd and not to cast anything a doubt on on a medical but they're tool box is a drug or a surgery they don't have the resources of nutrition to the level and the understanding\nThat I Do and so uh Larry saw that he needed to get somebody else with a different tool box and affect a lower level of enter into a box or let's let's get all the resources here and open them all up and let's take you know let's get a plant and so that's what I offered was a plan\nWe started with detox thing and to help clear the way they let the body release a lot of congestion to let the body discharged things and then we went into a maintenance schedule but let's go back to to the timeline of how you got to to such a deep problem\nOkay let me let me go back to Nineteen Ninety One that I Know that's a long time ago but I was diagnosed with a trans verse my light is of the fifth arrest vertebrae\nAnd what that simply mean as I had a severe virus settled into that joint and uh it was very serious in fact it was such a severe virus that the neurologist they went to in in Indiana said he only saw two or three cases a year\nAnd it when when it was done he looked at me and he just said layer you are the only person I've ever seen walk\nAfter having that virus everybody else's in wheelchairs and that was a miracle in itself but this is when it all started when I had this a virus I was given ... pro ... came out in eighty seven so it was still basically a a relatively new super drug super antibiotic\nAnd in March I was I was given twenty ... pro tablets and five days later I was in a are with a breathing issue I was admitted for three days but no one looked at the relationship between my breathing issues in ...\nLater that year I had injections and my feet because they were drawing up\nMoving down to the end of that decade in in Nineteen Ninety eight I had my first Arthur ... knee surgery or one of the effects of four Oakland loans is they have a way of just totally destroying your your knees and cartilage but then in in Ninety nine I was having heart issues heart cat was performed\nAnd uh I was discharged with forty ... pro and six days later I was back in ER\nAnd there was no connection between them and one of the the effects that I have learned about ... has a cumulative damage to it for oh quaint loans don't just do something and then it's gone but it just continually builds up so\nOne of the big issues that I dealt with in in two thousand and two I was given tech when\nMost people haven't heard about tech when because in May of two thousand two it was taken off the market but\nAfter taking ten tablets I was in for X rays in shots sores broke out on my lower arms I was tested for during the tightest in over the next fourteen years yeah fourteen years I've visited dermatologist in several states\nI had as many as a hundred stories at a time on both arms but no connection with floral Quinn loans was ever considered a today my lower arms are completely covered with\nUntil I got a hot tub in two thousand sixteen that I purchased a new hydra therapy for my peripheral neuropathy that they've subsided and I assume probably the Korean had a little bit to do with that but throughout the years I've just spent thousands of dollars on medications and doctors and test and everything else trying to find out what was going on\nAnd it just seems that a floral Quinn loans were the culprit during those years I was treated for congestive heart failure or I was given prescriptions a Corvette is all cream menace cycling for skin infections are salsa mess for ...\nAffects the dying for itching and highs me ... meant a mirror perplexed for restless legs syndrome and the list goes on and on and on\nIn October of two thousand eight ahead about with kidney stones and I was given forty ... pro as part of the follow up two weeks later I was an urgent care\nOr in two thousand ten I was getting a scene neurologist and I've already mentioned the reaction I had an Iranian I reacted assembled to in the same way\nAnd a two thousand eleven I had a bout with pneumonia at an urgent care I was given ten levick went in three days later I was getting a CAT scan of my heart\nIn August of eleven I received just to live when in ten days later I was getting another CAT scan and during this time I ... I was continuing to battle with these sores on my arms I was seeing dermatologist I was taking medications again for fibromyalgia because it was that just seemed to be it\nSo when I I I moved through all of that and I get back to to two thousand Seventeen where things had reached this this crescendo uh in in the summer of Seventeen I had a severe reaction to poison ivy and I've not had a poison ivy issue since I was a little kid and I'm sixty five\nBut I was put on steroids for thirty days and had a serious reaction to them\nAnd everybody's like oh boy things are really going downhill they're getting horrible I went to see another neurologist and mow bill a hate concurred that this would peripheral neuropathy but he totally disagreed with the whole concept of flow Quinn of loans\nSo thin end up these out thousands Seventeen we're even looking at psoriasis I was sent to a rheumatologist so as you can tell\nI felt like a guinea pig and they just kept sending me here and there so people could could see what was going on and that's when in December of Seventeen uh I went to see Carl at the herbs shop\nAnd as we've already talked we've been going through these test [noise]\nBut I I think there's issues there with wheat that my body doesn't digest it and it creates issues same thing with pasta\nI Love spaghetti and we just had to make the switch from traditional pasta into rice\nA pastas and I can tell all the difference in the world I used to have a big plate of spaghetti and think oh I ate too much you know my body was telling me you're consuming a wheat product and you really don't need to be doing that so that that was a big switch or your history\nOf the way you had the symptom like poison ivy but a skin rashes um the inflammation so foods trigger and inflation response of your body can handle it\nYour history of certain medications\nI knew your liver would be compromise that how it could produce its own his demands\nAnd so you couldn't elevate an antihistamine natural response so you acted like so there were times when you said you to dozens of ... [laughter] a and a few days to try to stop the itching and they say you were over producing the histamine\nSo that you could cross reference the the plant paradox diet to also a low histamine diet\nOr and save the similarities in those diets but\nA low inflammatory diet a low histamine diet or or the plant paradox there there's a lot of similarities in it but the point is there's certain foods that are known\nTo to make more of an inflammatory response and that puts more work and more pain on the body and more bloating and and and kind of not feeling\nOf energized after eating and so that's the logic behind this and and the result is is there to show it uh you felt better when you started eliminating certain foods\nSome some of the changes that we made we we switched from your traditional Irish potatoes sweet potatoes now I have like sweet potatoes are I I I don't know I probably average eating sweep tastes were five times a week\nAnd you know chicken became my native choice\nI I've always like chicken anyway and so it was easy for me to just push some of the other stuff away I I quit peanut butter\nYou know ... big about cutting out peanut butter and I was a peanut butter hall like I guess you could call me I if I ever got hungry and make a peanut butter sandwich in in eighty going out the door and on the men and eating bread eat peanut butter and that's not helping me a bit\nBut um you know we began you\nIt was much organic foods as we can get our hands on a fresh fruit and vegetables became a mainstay in our diets we we switched from canola oil to all of an avocado oil and uh I've actually I don't like a\nAvocados at all on make that clear I just don't like I cannot [laughter] but I I had some some friends who own a Mexican restaurant that uh\nThey they found out that if they mixed with their guacamole with the good guy you know that I liked it and so I I have it shipped to me but uh\nYou know so I can eat that in salads are in wraps and and I'm I'm In in good shape there but the changes that that you make\nAre are crucial and you have to stop and realize what you used to think just made you feel over full your body\nWas actually re nagging on that telling you that you you shouldn't have been doing that at all and so that's one of the things I've learned from plant paradox that that I Need to listen to my body more I I used to just ignore it and think oh I'm I'm having a bad day and really my body was\nTelling me you're eating stuff you don't need to be eating and you need to make some changes ...\nWell that's a little bit of the psychology and comfort foods or comfort eating is you think you're going to enjoy and have this elation\nBut then the the the bloated feeling the heavy feeling the the the the wanting\nTo take a nap or feel hired a as a side effect so a re recognizing is your goal to have a productivity energy the endurance is is that your goal or is your goal kind of a momentary are sweet taste desire main that is five\nOr so we have to look at this balance of what our food offers and what we can gain from the food and what we can we can lose our health from the food the wrong foods so the food plays a big part in our overall wellness if ... if you've just tuned in is Carl Schmidt and I'm interviewing and discussing with Larry stover\nOr his change in health and how serious is conditions where I'm at the

working in my yard I'm taking care of projects around the house\nWhere I I can actually you know get down on my hands and knees and do things a or a lay under a sink in and fix up plumbing problem where I couldn't do that before there was no no strength or energy so\nI I'm I'm Still behind I mean when you think about it I basically was not able to do anything around my house for five years and it's it's caught up with me but we're getting it back\nAgain in my strength back I'm able to do things I'm able to spend more time with with my family especially my two grand kids that are full of energy\nAnd and those kinds of things are are great because uh I I tell people I feel better than I have felt in five years and I I've got the energy and strength ahead even before that period in in my life then I feel like I'm On the road to getting back to taking charge of things\nAnd I I'm actually hoping by next summer to where I'm going to be able to get back into some areas ministry again because I Hope I didn't have enough stamina and physical whereabouts\nAnd not a down in my mind in that regard\nBut I think uh people you know getting near retirement age and they think OK well at least coast it through and\nAnd worst comes to worst I can you know I've got a recliner over here in a remote over here in the refrigerator not too far away I mean if you want more out alive than that

years and I was in my doctor's office it was a hundred and Seventy over a hundred and and my family doctor that's it you're going on blood pressure meds and and the stubbornness and me came out and I'm like I don't want to go on blood pressure medication so I left\nHis office and drove to the herbs shop\nAnd I was telling car on what was going on and he's like I have what you need and I'm like okay what's that [noise] and you you brought out these in Seoul's for my my shoes and a skeptic in me it had it came out again and I'm like uh-huh\nSo anyway you you said take these home\nAnd I want you to wear 'em and I once you start taking your BP and so I said okay I I Will do that and and I was amazed uh I think it was three days later my BP had dropped down to a hundred and thirty over Seventy five\nAnd it has stayed relatively in in that range ever since and I I still wear in soles in my shoes every day\nAnd I I Am amazed by it and I'm I'm Talking to two people every week about this is amazing how many people have high blood pressure these days but again when you think about what we eat I'm not surprised that the whole world and have high blood pressure\nBut uh I'm trying to tell them I'm like look it would be the best investment you could ever make\nTo to buy a set of these things and try and I said there's not a whole lot of difference in the cost of them in a couple of rounds of blood pressure medicine so you don't have anything to lose and uh I have probably six or eight people right now that are probably so close to taken the plunge and\nI'm I'm working on them because I'm I'm Amazed again that are those in Seoul's did so much and you can explain the particulars of how they work on I'm\nWell like the there's a show if people want to tune in like a on our

us and we study the people who have found solutions to the trends or are uniquely working within the trends that are shaping the work place in the workforce around us and I would say to somebody who came to me\nAnd said damn I have a goal of getting into the print media business I Want to create a newspaper I Want to create a magazine I Would look at him and say man I think that ship has sailed I think you should probably do something else\nBut I realize there are some newspapers and there are some magazines that\nHave found a toehold in today's economy and some of them struggled through very difficult time post two thousand seven two thousand eight the great recession if you'll recall that time Craig's list to maybe just been born\nAnd a lot of the advertisement that the newspapers were take with classified ads I mean those things I I\nMy inclination is to say that those classified ads in the backs of the newspaper or just cash cows for them they were uh selling a just a small amount of space at a pretty good price and that's where the community when to buy and sell them to learn things when Craig's list came out it disrupted that to say the least\nAnd as well as ... as well as all the other online sales things but Craig's list as I recall seems to be the big culprit\nAnd it crushed a lot of these print publications particularly the newspapers\nBut if he rolled around most communities you're going to find a local ... least any community of any size\nA local weekly independent maybe it's by weekly independent newspaper\nThat seems to be doing well\nAnd we're going to talk about the trend of bucking the print media industry in the year two thousand Eighteen and it really begins in the year two thousand in a sense the print media took a big hit with the great recession we're advertising either win away or changed in form\nA the advertisers who couldn't afford it just simply vanished to many of the advertising clients just simply vanished couldn't keep the doors open yet again some of them seem to be doing quite well our conversation today\nIs going to talk to the coke publishers of\nThe ... newspaper here in ... it's a weekly independent thirty thousand in circulation about eighty thousand readers per week\nAnd we're going to learn how they've grown their business post great recession it's not something that I ever thought I Would here we're going to learn what decisions they made a man and\nSee which of these decisions would be applicable across businesses across industries is there something that they know that they did that they could advise you and me on on growing their own business in keeping a weekly print newspaper alive I'm always looking for feedback on the show [noise]\nHere's a couple of ways you can give us some feedback and that is the first the phone line to five one to six or eighty one hundred that is both phone an textile said\nI don't think we're kind of light in line I think we're just trying to find three or our Marquette or of our audience and the best I can handle wanna tell any story then in ...\nAs you said and when I'm American and on the air you know in this era a nice way on it you know it you know ... you get it right accurate and we don't\nGet the L even more\nLikely that like we always have that we have to really be on on our game on the order a liar\nAnd where it and the hospital\nWell let's talk about that the hostilities are meaning you know there's no doubt that the the tenor of the tone of the media consumer has changed particularly in the last Eighteen months or so uh when someone says the term fake news\n... what are you saying let's not let's let's go next to when when they can work publication of fake news but generally do you have a does taste bile in the back of your throat as a Newsweek or person as soon as having\nA kid can't really to me I mean it I mean it's pretty ridiculous at the Atlantic and added it's not fake it just it ain't they don't agree with that but\nI mean it's aggravating but I mean I really like that I mean certainly we get it but I felt like it's more of a national ice skate I mean I think people now we're back I went down to the house in order to make a name for high ... or just cover for getting out and get on it at our\nEvery go ahead Rob I'm Sorry\nI pretty much every time you faced something somebody doesn't like the story they don't like 'em or if you're interviewing you know a politician or somebody and they don't like that where this which way the story's going um\nThey call it fake news and so it it has lost if somebody is email me yesterday and said that to me I just wrote back I was like you know fake news has no value to me or that that terminology is is a joke it's become ridiculous\nI mean to interrupt you on that we're going to go to break I Want to hear more about your opinions on this socialist into what's working on ... and I am Rob ... and actually try on line with land you know weekly we're talking

Trice online they were the co argued co editors come publisher so I think it's co publishers ... publisher in it or anything yeah\nPretty much everything lenient in Mobile Alabama we are talking about the print industry in our time today we were we were kind of talking about fake news I Want to hear robber actually wouldn't have you guys do proactively to make sure your presenting\nBoth sides of the story but stereotypes of of all media is that it leans left with a couple of notable exceptions\nDo you go through pains to make sure it is equal or the coverage of any stories equal unbiased do you work actively do research the other side whichever side that may be talked to me about how you gather content for the stories to make sure it's well represented\nWell I I mean our heart story at all um I think a lot of the people did not realize or we have an opinion on and are are in our commentary ... and that as an glass ... at\nWhat I what I think every get it or set up a market for it I mean we get\nIt ... it can I rented or people who are to live I mean and and that that are doing our job like that\nThe challenge of an\nIdeas on any number is ...\nAnd ... and paint politics at all but when it comes to covering the story we try to present and bring on a leading everyone opportunity Kate came comment on me you know a ... ... ... when I Try and they don't have an agenda of it so\nWe do a lot of investigative reporting and um that's that's one thing that really makes this newspaper very different from a lot is that we really committed ourselves to a lot of long form investigative journalism with that either\nYou have the responsibility to offer opportunities for people to explain themselves are typically people don't take that opportunity\nAnd that he you know when when you're on to something\nA lot of times when people say they don't want to talk about it I'm not going to talk about it and then they run around it's fake news or the ... you know they were is treated and that's a that's a pretty typical response we've been doing this for a long time and\nYou know I've never had anybody say boy you guys got that right you know in in it almost Thirty years of journalism I've been wrong but every story we've ever done\nIs just you know that you're dealing with it just has to try to be fair and try to get both sides of the story in but you know a lot of that also is dependent on people answering questions\n[noise] that's funny so none of the people you've ever written about that have been exposed her featured or anything like that in a news story has contract to do to say you know what that was pretty accurate it really hurt my career and my future but I got to give him credit for his mark\nTodd a single one [laughter] you feel like when a when in so many communities\nThe newspapers the weekly or the daily rather newspaper says they have historically been known\nHad to roll up and go to three times a week in some cases disappear entirely do you feel like there was a sigh of relief in certain leadership components or elected components of the society to say good riddance now I don't have somebody looking over my shoulder was the era\nWas there a a a sigh of relief from some of these decision makers as the newspapers left town\nI think if you see any area that doesn't have a very big news coverage is you're going to see more corruption I think that you can look at that they want their hand in hand um I think they are certainly people who are good public leaders don't save value and not having a daily newspaper not having a good newspaper in their town\nOr people who want to get away with things wrong with it but I you know I I Would say the minority in most places but they they make a lot of boys and they create a lot of trouble but you know that's what that's what newspapers or for that we are in the fourth estate payments\nAnd in a lot of us still take that very seriously and that that's it is important or dirty to have a strong newspaper watchdog that's the thing\nThrough your advertisers continue valuing the fourth estate or are they looking for eyeballs only or are they are they in for the belief of what you stand for or is it the eyeballs\nDifferent little of that yeah I think they kind of getting a little bit you know providing um I ... and you get A's coverage on our readers are going to pick it up and advertisers ... an eight by reading the paper in ... and now they're getting value at\n... ...\nHave you ever uh been offered a bribe to or not to print something [laughter] [noise] not in the\nLA and I think we've been we've been threatened I'm sure yeah well\nFor whatever else you know those those are\nThat's just part of the business you have to deal with people in stupid things like that but no I you know people get upset when they're when they're being exposed when things are being exposed or or stories they don't like there are people who get upset there are people who are\nIn a reasonable about if there was some politicians who understand that's that's all part of the the deal and there are just some rebel and he'd react very poorly when when ... written about them that they don't have that is not going\nWhere\nMine came marched in show what's working our focus workplace in workforce trends and if there's any industry has struggled post great recession it's got to be the newspaper in print industry\nIn a million new struggles with the current presidential administration beginning to accuse any story that didn't favor them as fake news yet this group continues to thrive they continue to grow they continue to gain readership and Rob just before the break you were talking about having to\nBe hyper local I Want to hear how you define hyper local in how any business in any one of our listening areas can take that idea and apply it to their own business hyper local\nI mean for for us it means covering news that you're not going to get anywhere else or you know for anybody else it's going to be something that you can't get\nOn the world Wide Web you can't replicate it and that's I think that's the tough part for a lot of businesses um is trying to find a place where you fit and that people come in and say man is the only place we can get this I mean you think about your work\nProximity to the restaurant but also you know there's all these chain restaurants that are producing the same things around here why then the other two were restaurant because it's a trick they have something that is unique and that's that's kind of I don't have to look at it was like especially in these days\n[noise] talk to me about your brand don't to me about how you make your brain unique it must be easy to see a competitors or a similar ... publications in other communities that you may keep an eye on and want to start to him between them 'cause you like them but you can retain a brand unique to yourself how hard\nIs it to maintain a distinct brand in our in our day\nAlone I think our brand very like our community a lot actually is very unique and has a lot of flavor okay I think it can make it easy and all and that\nMind as to keep my though on TV and yeah I think that we try to live by that you know cattle on a story that aren't being tall and in a trial a law like make it out our our entity and tell that story at\nHonda and makes it easier to keep the wrong a strong and and you're doing\nI think anything that supports the idea of keeping mobile funky a is a heck of a challenge man when you when you can say does this help keep mobile phone getting the answer is yes it's got to be a great feeling to keep the cell phone but every commercial heart yeah\nSo many communities want their unique brand communicated and you guys seem to have done it quite well with mobile and laying there but at least in my own opinion I'm curious let's move on into talent\nTalent is a challenge for every one of my employers are was recently this week in both Chicago and in San Diego\nAnd a common complaint with both was how do we find and keep good talent and then they added challenge of finding people that can report in research done right well tell me how you find talent and what you're when\nYou're looking for to know that someone's going to do well in your business\nI don't know it's it's always difficult to\nInsure I Would never been any of my vital organs on anybody that you know so this is going to be\nAnd and if I go home and I mean we always anytime that we enter a online and hire that person is going to be an ally [noise] wait I you know on the end of a turnout that sort of our our ... that we actually ended up\nWith a team that I mean it definitely is hard to I mean at at a part of it in a work in his etiquette in there and and he\nIs there a background you're looking for\nWell I mean they're kind of reporting um you know or you know a lot of industry are a lot of the journal or that\nUm yeah ourselves a lot I'm Sorry I mean I'll take a A R A L and set it at all not at all and a lot or other out\nIn a an on again off or something like ...\nOn a on a lot in my head on and on a local ...\nYeah it's I mean it's it's not easy with these things um I think you know for one player and talked about they talk about retention at least\nUm the people who come here enjoy coming here to write because we're doing ... story is that journalists want to do I'm most journalists have been small newspapers you end up in the stories about you know somebody's quilts collection or somebody\nBecause growing a giant cabbage occasionally against somebody stuff um we we don't do that stuff you know that we don't do a lot of community news which is a shame but it's just part of the way it's the way life is now and so\nYou know most of what we're what we're doing is investigative reporting are covering bigger stories and reporters are into that and you know so a lot of it\nYou know it talked about brand a lot of I think what makes a brand you make or any brand is there's got to be a truly from this about doing the job that comes through can your readers or to your customers and you know what to say that I think I Hope that's what\nWe have it in the paper that there's still some fun and still some joy in it and people were picking it up and saying and I don't know what it's going to have this week but there's going to be something interesting and exciting\nYou know what you've said something that I think most people would find a somewhat confusing their their their browser for road right now do ... and doing the job joyful illness and producing the product on a weekly basis is that a a\nI mean I Can't imagine that you go around your workplaces going is everybody feeling joyful now you've\nGot to go ahead you gotta you gotta look if you're if you're doing what we're doing right now at our in our business and you're still allowed to do it you better be very excited that you're allowed to do it I mean it's it's a\nFor me and Ashley both I think it's it's a dream come true to be able to the newspaper publisher gym to put out a newspaper for sixteen years now that is that's not me saying we take lightly other tough days but it I mean that either you\nOr you know I'm I'm fifty one years old so um if if I were in a traditional newspaper I probably should have been kicked out of the curve right now and try to find a job doing something else so I'm very happy to still be in the journalism and so I Hope that that part you know when you come to work you should be excited about it but\nYou know your employer would be telling you don't come back with any more giant cabbage stories we've already [laughter] Mrs Jones joined cabbage is you know once you've reported on ending cabbage now five times go to some real work [laughter] that's a big story so I Want to do the same bag for me if you will a\nJump in your own a year book and flip some pages

when it's\nKind of I mean we're ... or people who are not happy to get it either and I did that and you know and you know can is an opportunity in either on a weekly paper at that point and that will definitely at a tiny place\nSo it was like the demise of your of your favorite competitor very competitor but there are your favorite competitor and when they went away it was a new seized on that opportunity on\nRight now that I'm going to have any way I mean that every young or old lethal aid\nYou take her back and we had to leave feeling yelling at all [noise]\nI think we have than the number of times but we've been struck by lightning is amazing because he did uh we've we've gotten lucky I'm many many times I think one thing that sticks in my head was early on that we're allowed to be the uh\nThe official get on it for basis which was our large a concert or you know we have a big festival music festival in which a late September early October and\nVery early on we were allowed to do that and um they put together a guide for them and it became a big paper horse at a time when we didn't have a big paper and and that was that was something that put some money in the in the coffers for us and um you know they're just been in some related\nMelissa Melissa my work but it's actually said gosh I guess if somebody up there like the ... something new to this happened to the soup and we've had a lot of good things that have happened to that kind of came out a little older\n[noise]\n\nChevrolet Master control center says is W.

S. obeys\nPage share this we need to be calling the governor we need to be calling our representatives we need to demand change and we need to demand it quickly because uh you know these these violent people being back on the street are just going to\nContinue to commit violent crimes I'll give you another example we had been told that another person up for parole was in prison on his second murder\nTimes two is up for parole again so he he's already committed one murder known to prison got out as committed another murder and now there's parole board is putting him back up or ... that is someone they shouldn't even be considering but yet here we are I mean you know\nWhy it went to space wintertime difference when the point that he committed the murder and then the boys had he was in jail and how long has your impression at first\nIt was the first murder was many years ago okay so I mean it's not like this all happened within a five year period so there is some time but it doesn't matter where you can order one murder and you get out and you commit another murder you know track record we have an example of that Mario Woodward who killed officer police officer Keith out\nYou know um he he had been in prison\nOfficer house so you know it's as they do their job which I Know that's asking a lot but if they would just do their job and stop\nYou know just on a on a whim letting these folks out and if they had public safety at the head of of their thoughts them than their thought process and what they're supposed to be doing none of this would be happening but you know I'm at the point where I don't think they care about public safety I think they care about money dollars\nI was told that I don't know if it was a commissioner or deal sea but one of the high level\nMembers that deal sea was at the parole board during these uh most recent hearings that we had where this guy was let out that lets me know I mean he could have been there for something else I'm not going to say that but it does at least um\nWhen some credibility that deal sea is pushing for this as well\nAnd hey the governor controls all this I think the governor and you know I've been in contact with the governor they assured me that they're going to address is ... and I believe that\nBut you know I think the governor needs to act and needs to act quickly because again we don't need anybody else losing their lives because of what these Yahoo's are doing that but the ... there's going to the phones let's go to Henry Henry on board with a ... by late\nMorning then I you know what I'm doing good Henry that afternoon Lyn Henry calling on\nJust on the comment that I that I could turn me on my neighbor on Darrell Bailey during an outstanding job and I caught in one hundred percent and I'll stop mom going do um when I get out of time with this attorney I'm a corridor governor's office\nAnd I also have an email address but I just think that we can't\nPut our police officers and more in danger we get them off the street and then the parole board is putting on back on the street\nYou know that's not right but I ... and the mayor Montgomery a police department they're doing a great job either district attorney he's doing an outstanding job so\nAnd we are so willing to pay everybody with the same wide brush\nAnd\nI Can't at a double murder yeah I understand that never should be Perot but\nMaybe we need to look at the underside also [noise]\nOkay I may I add nobody said everybody's guilty and everybody should be locked up forever nobody's that no one here said that\nYou're you're against their what is this opinion or what I just said [noise]\nListen first of all I'm Glad that um [noise] he's reformed and he's doing good but one thing I Do know is you can predict the future by\nWhat people um do repeatedly for instance through the Senate passed ... is a good future and the capsule\nIt like for instance what brought all this up and is is really selling the light on what's going on at the parole board is this guy who committed these multiple robberies and shot a man almost killing him\nWhen he goes to prison does ... does he take advantage of the classes as the other is education does he do what he's supposed to know or he goes and attacks prison guards commits a sex offense does all these things\nThat we should show a parole board or anybody reviewing his father hey this is not a person that needs to be back out on the streets\nAre great OK yeah but how many of those people are actually a problem I think you said one hundred eighty people\nWent up five ... five hundred and fifty one\nOkay so a hundred and eighty can't roll out back\nAnd the and the essence I listed three that were really the most serious\nCriminals and on and we would all agree should never ever have been granted parole and I will agree those three should not maybe we need some kind of legislative a remedy that situation\nI'd had we created such obscure such a wide variety of latitude or the parole board to be given in and it says you're making maybe we need we need to restrict that\nNo doubt yeah so I grew up [noise] you know some guy had been told have\nThe governor actually has the authority to reverse parole board to citizens um you know I\nGot back there I'm I'm not you actually have somebody that's been elected ... be held accountable I never heard of in a ... or ... ... members or they're not at lower appointed and they and Alabama and there's no symbol or any kind of\nRetribution towards them should they\nAnd here's the problem but here's the problem with the parole board which is which was mentioned in article is that they really don't have any government or they can pretty much do what I Want to one they want to and and that's a shame the board\nSays made in the sand about Obama's isn't that a good system at all\nBut now the people you hold responsible are the elected officials and there are elected officials who put those parole board members on the board now I'm not a\nCurious what are the qualifications to be eight or ... on ... ages as qualified and is that there is no qualifications ...\nYou know it's it's really a part time job to get a vehicle and they're paid over a hundred thousand dollars and years mind\nI don't know what I'm saying this gentleman of research thanks Bye bye head [noise] as a board system in Alabama's of I mean whether you're talking about hair cousin Haji border you're talking about at this commission is terrible you go to Ken Ken welcome born today Marcia\nHey Dan [noise] got a question for Easter Bailey I'm actually looking at it from the other side of the spectrum I don't think it's three enough because obviously going to prison is not a deterrent for crime anymore and I'm curious what you at the district attorney [noise]\nSee the possibility of changing the white punishment is held out to make it an actual deterrent once again in this nation\nWell first of all we've got to do what we're ... we're going to be honest about what we're doing now is a fraud I mean nobody knows that the judge doesn't know the prosecutor doesn't know the victim doesn't know the defendant doesn't know defense started nobody knows\nWhen sentences handed down how long that person's going to serve in prison we don't even have a wild guess anymore [noise]\nUm ... you look at the parole boards own rules which I have in front of me right now that says that on a volunteer fence that the initial Perot consideration Shelby set\nAfter an inmate completion of eighty five percent of his or her total sense or Fifteen Years which is less well we know that's not true that we know that they're not even following their own policies [noise]\nSo you know the first thing we're going to have to do and we were promised this by our legislature and I hate to keep bringing this up but our legislature is pitiful\nAnd they promised us when we had sentencing reform that at some point in this process that we were going to have truth in sentencing so that we all knew everybody knows when someone has given us in it that is what they're saying this is going to be all\nAbout the deeper issues that centrist is light happy or otherwise is deterring crime\nHow do you as a law enforcement official solution to stop the crimes from happening in the first place people are scared to go to prison is what I'm getting at that means nothing anymore [noise]\nWell that probably depends on the person I don't necessarily disagree with you but there's there are a lot of people that are made who who did not like president never want to go back so I won't say there's not a deterrent to to everyone\nBut it is obviously very complicated one of the things that we have to do and I talk about this all the time were down one of them on on on the other topics is that we've got to be proactive ah you know working with kids and parents and everybody else to keep the kids and\nA venture all the people who grew into adults out of the system to begin with if we got to reform that whole process you know our education system and you know mental worrying and and all kinds of things that that we can do with that\nBut as far as a deterrent you know once the crimes committed the only thing I knew as prison um that's the only thing I Know can be a deterrent once someone has committed murder\nAssault or a robbery or something like that if you have better ideals I'd love to hear because right now that's all I Know that we have in the criminal justice system\nIt seems that get dropped off there [noise]\nBut um you know of one of our favorite to law enforcement officer saying if one of the things that stops crime escaping the criminals locked up there as soon as they get out and even if they go into doing lesser offenses they have a tendency to be to committing crimes [laughter] you know downtown and go back in ...\nYeah I mean art Baylor when he was chief of police or Montgomery I saw this week I mean he was famous for always saying you know it's two or three percent of the people who are committing the crime over and over and over it\nAnd arrested multiple multiple multiple times\nAnd yeah I mean and I do believe that and you know obviously it's not helping matters by taking the violent offenders and putting them right back out on the street I mean what do we have a ... you know ... these people got to live somewhere where they could be living next door to you\nAnd when you're sad part is they normally go back to where they came from having worked in helping folks have gotten out of prison not to get back into the environment 'cause it said that environment is where\nHe learned in had to go stay or whatever so you would hope moment with the bill type thing absolutely to the phones to John and have a question for your own way gun was more today more show than we do by\nThat are violent how're you doing anything it was great how are you a great uh money Don I'm an I'm an extra ... a couple of times and I will agree with you a hundred percent I I Do agree there is there one group and they should never say Las Vegas [noise]\nYou know ... or you have to ... I was ... I went walk okay ... supposedly the second one a gun and as soon as we do is go ahead Jim\nUh-huh and uh you know and I'm not going to stay here by I was an angel or anything like that I felt like I gave me a ... like I Do find here's the truth of the matter\nIs I've been in stock for his first and when you have the fire that burned ears or body\nAt it for ... who's ... who's got money ... pool it's got there and they worked all the way up with the war I literally thing in the newspapers have both the whole ... murder case\nThat will get but at least by an honor and they don't have to be used to pay for it but now ...\nYou know anything that Mike ... book the carpets but what they do on the other and make me for even borrows the four hours and and they get treated like their ...\nAnd then they release and you'd think non non violent offenders like myself I was not a pilot or better odds are backed by a fabric\nAnd you know it literally took me almost an act of Congress considers\nJohn ... here's the deal was made and this is my perspective on that I Want us to do everything we can to help non violent offenders the route rehabilitated I Want us to whatever programs which and come up with whatever things we can do to reform non violent offenders I'm all for I'm not\nThey can be willing to step up and go you know we grew up and I need to be held responsible\nIn do you remember the name of Dan I'm Wondering what would happen if one of the board members is indicted by grand jury for being complicit murder [laughter]\nRight now we're in ... but I didn't want to meddle in whatever you\nDecide to do I'm ...

I Believe so so wash room was before I unmanned wasn't it was\nOh what a\nYou know I don't I just wanted to and I remember ... eight yeah OK okay uh\nWell I mean the longest time we knew that there was going to be a marvel phase Sylvia Atlantic\nYou this is D.C\nSince she was asked one they didn't have phases as I understand the hundred was before that yes three hundred sick yeah three hundred in them before the big but um look thing they and they and are these are stories and want to make\nAnd there was like a list of like twenty five stories that they said they want to make a Washington was on that as well as darn returns which is a frightening or written a tale\nLast like how many hundred as well and the a watchman is by Alan Moore and so the swamp thing movies that they're working on developing this country's Alan Moore's work um but\nThey had all these fantastic stories\nA fan's we're familiar with all of the eighties is the thing that brought comments to the for the killing joke very dark tales but very fit the world that the Batman and joker living or then you know and they they at some point they just completely off of that the TV show started hitting it was almost like I said okay well let's just go with\nSuper special effects TV shows they're not going with any of the stories that have the ... Wonder Woman obviously it was really good and Batman Begins was very true to the uh Batman origins\nBut the other two you know this of course everybody talks about Heath Ledger letters joker portrayal\nAnd that was the best thing about that movie to face was good but there was a third one and the lines in a more very you know they just they banned it and they've got in this but both companies there's so much material that's good\nBut it seems like when the streamlined is get a hold of it all bets are off my Batman my favorite Batman as always has been in most likely will be a Kevin Connolly\nTheir vocalist their vocal Batman just portrayal of Batman the animated series is my favorite [laughter]\nI'm not a union we've talked about this I'm not loyal to a voice actor no they're not as an actor doing a character yeah earlier but I'm not loyal to voice after doing a character I liked his I liked I liked the animated series I liked the trials in it I liked the stories I liked the look I like the music I like the and\nThere was a fan made short several years ago I Can't remember exactly when that was unbelievable the special effects everything and the guy that they had to play it I Can't remember the name of the guy that had playing Batman just killed and um it was it was but I think it was before Batman Begins advantage thousand two thousand three\nAnd it was like this huge sensation and everybody you know they said hey let's get this petition they got tens of thousands of signatures but again you know China\nThey the the Warner Brothers folks and ... that's what I that's what I'll never understand is that they have a they have a massive\nPool to pick from of of talent as far as writers and story ideas and everything else and they just don't do it mainly because I think when they settle on a director directors like where you're going to use my writer and you're going to use this if you want me to do and I'm going to do it you have to do it my way and they really want\nTo put my spin on it you would have would knows exactly how this is my vision of what a Batman or insert ... popular ... book a character here you know how they used a\nHollywood alliances to step to cast the county has because some of these people don't most unlikely and and oftentimes we as fans like oh it's going to be horrible and it is\nSo I think the best movies just seems like when they go out and find somebody that they think would fit the role you know some young actor who is hungry and just kills the role you know it just doesn't like\nGallagher do I know she's been other stuff but man she was born to play Wonder Woman here they went around the perfect person wasn't Tom Holland thing I did a Spiderman yes I mean they wouldn't have happened to your number one he's on his thirties was All right I'm\nFat that alone was pretty cool there's that shows a Andrew Garfield sitting on the side would send a kid and said who knew\nUh I Wonder if ... knew he was sitting beside town hall and it's like six year olds yeah but I mean I thought I liked his trailer Spider Man\nIt's all you know look for the next one the first to tell the ...

I was I was doing my backpacks I was going through and getting all the backpacks that's good to have and yeah I did I got 'em all um and I got all the the minor crime thugs things have you met up with a black cat\nOn you know I've seen her image all over some of these places that's another thing to hunt for me now is just too when you do at that I've seen her image everywhere on dog graffiti down to ... I was over in that area of getting a backpack now ... you know\nSwing interests cemetery I was like oh this is a cemetery I I'd\nI'd you know I didn't think anything of it yeah until you just mentioned\nSome little some something this blip on screen fizzled out some you can interact with and you just it just kept going by I mean nothing no nothing ever did nothing down interact me a while to find it 'cause like you know you had to travel around but I did a great area of around like\nSadly gyms those at a sea up there yeah it's worth it's worth doing um what level or you\nFifty okay so if you aren't level fifty or the suit you don't have to power and suit abilities get\nFifty one that the level fifty suit ability that you could ... could you have the three different abilities or the the level fifty one is it'll show the hidden the secret a photo locations on the map ... and that's why I quit that\nAnd that's where you know because there's some right up there in the in the graveyard\nOkay so that's something to look a look forward to and then I have to look into that I'm\nAn alpha clearing out little bits and pieces of the a of a test masters um challenges\nI cleared them all at least with a level one\nKind of get level to the drones ... my ... my least favorite pie that whole game ... is the is the height control\nSwing it forward is no problem is the height thing when suddenly drops now goes under a bridge and why and you and I have to try and I'm like two hundred feet above and I'm like suddenly I have to go swinging from full speed dropped down to the bridge and\nAnd catch it now there are no have you done any ... no I haven't I don't know lock that the ... the closest I got to it was doing aside mission recently where I had to chase them dubs oh the other end of it yeah yeah I'm Sorry to have the ... from the pages that I did the uh what are they called ... birds or something I Can't remember the ... yeah yeah\nBut ... the the stealth ones I enjoyed ... the the fighting ones not bad now we have to try to keep a combo besides you can that's the challenge of it yeah the bomb ones are All right and but the the drones are but drones within the drones are just a\nA a pain for me I think we've had is ... that's going to be the reason why I'm not going to platinum this game\nIn my case I'd have to do a more I'm more of those challenges because like like like you I just wanted to get them out the way ... declared for clearing for the sake of playing them but um some of the sense that I got to think I've got four suits left 'em well five now you mentioned the um the\nE su suit but a lot of the required challenge tokens and I think I Need about eight of them\nTo get the ones that I Need I got all the other all the other stuff that I've got a baby she based hope is here and there but for the most part I'm going to be challenged ... minds up to ... in my mind that gadget upgrades are all ... all the waiting on challenge tokens that I don't have ...\nYeah well we're going to have to go back and do a lot of hope hopefully it'll just be a\nStealth in combat that I'm missing a adult level of achievement ought to get that I could if I get back to find those to do those I'll probably have enough challenge to get what I Need to get\nBut if I have to go back for um drone or bomb challenges is going to be a chore yeah hopefully it won't be too much 'cause I got to get stuff for my ... well maybe this new game plus it\nAs an option\nShould be everything everything carries over four million plus usually maybe this new game plus it and then re do when you get to the challenge to reduce them at that point then you'll have enough to that might be to it\nMaybe\nWho knows you know [noise] ah so yeah I really haven't played much else and just as a as a PSA to everybody [noise] um you're you're free to you know for game releases and you want to get the game you can go ahead and do whatever you want but\nThere's something to consider because me and marriage is talking about this he was looking at but he was talking about getting\nA yet some money coming soon you're gonna get a sense of St odyssey and honest and and I are out of this to you know let's say CEO either way and I told you hold off on that began in non for any other reason than the fact that a\nNovember is coming up soon Black Friday comes into play\nYou'd be soft is notorious for putting their games no matter how close they release in a Black Friday on sale for electricity prices I'm given this at a early October release I think you're going to see a really good price a reduction probably in the thirty dollar range yeah\nAt the very least in the thirty dollar range for that so\nAnd I was the same thing I was so new and and I was telling RJ as well you know if you are going to jump into destiny for say can hold off and I hate saying that because I really want to hear to play with with us now but I'm just just hold off on it because it's going to be cheaper come Black Friday and uh and that's kind of the way I Do all that you're a\nTech stuff you know if you're looking into getting a TV or looking into getting any kind of a electronic gadget or something like that I Want that Oculus without the wires\nNo it's called something else I thought it might\nBe but I don't think it's called ...
