I just add something about me and banana and I'm not home ... thanks very much probably they will do that a peanut butter and baking sandwich I Do that but that was one that I just can't bananas doctor told me eat bananas essential that appeal as well you know bananas have potassium\nAddress right but there's gotta lotta sugar and I'm too yeah so there could be some part of your body says they don't really like this is my mouth that says they don't lock him as a waste of consistency and I just I don't know what it is not as ...\nWell I Hope I don't die not knowing\nYou don't mind I don't not knowing what am I managed to stay so I Know what they taste like I just don't like that to happen that often I cite paid her for going you could you tell me why didn't lock but now it may be he'll know maybe I'll look it up and he's got that book you know a rabbi in there yeah yeah exactly I Hope I don't keep me out\nNow they will they will they'll let you read only ... nothing really gay barely thou shalt eat the banana or not pass without damaging you'll be like just chicken\nYou know we're so history repeats itself what this shows about mhm you know uh\nIt it does it does repeat itself over and over and over and the first part I think of this show we had the news flash yeah and uh it reminded me of a you know seeing these old reel to reel isn't a lot of\nThese flash kind of things and uh\nEvery time I hear that I think of the the big balloon that blew up Hynden bird yeah man\nToday and oh the humanity of it and you know in what I think of that thing blowing up I always think of the stock market when it's blowing up like a balloon in the ... and burns down and\nOh the humanity of all the retirement accounts just go in fall into the ground and people crime and we've been saying oh we've had only done something before this had happened if only I had a parachute if only I had not gotten on that bad\nHistorical wave if only if only I had done it before it was too late that's the message today from the message is\nMy friend plays look at look at the wave is going on it's going to go on maybe for a while maybe ... maybe it won't fall\nMaybe it'll just fewer our our flatten out ... but how in the I'm not saying they can't but I just don't see how\nThis kind of thing can ... I don't see it right I don't see to me it's scary and I'm afraid history is definitely going to repeat itself in a bad bad way I'm fully in defensive mode right now for a defensive mode\nDiapers not preaching doom and gloom no he's just telling you be owned your guard you might want to look at it and say yeah you know he's right\nMaybe I should do something and all you have to do is call him at three three four two seven nine seven four three warn you might not speak to him exactly at that moment who might have to call you back 'cause he might be in here doing this right right but\nHe will talk to you know sit down and talk with you and he will show you some some charts and some figures and talk about your situation that not your neighbors situation or Bob down the street but your situation and Tyler this whole thing to fit your financial needs but you won't find out all these things unless you call three three or four\nTo seven nine seven four three on call him to day\nAnd if you can't call did they call tomorrow call today it would be preferable to go ahead and get started quick is you can't yeah just leaving you name any information on it\nExpectations other than chatting and talking yeah that's the good thing that helped anything don't cost you anything but you know\nIf you're a young young person and you're doing your four O. one K. and all this man keep doing it yeah because that's the thing for you but as you age\nAnd you've got your goodies all ready you you're you're you've already got everything ready to to go ... and it's it could it could just change\nYour whole life if things go hey why so that's what I'm trying to say we utilize the stock market in different ways that are protecting you are\nAnd there's guarantees with these kind of programs to there in the insurance or a top world and that's another ... dimension of\nOf uh of of investing if you want to call it quantum economics or whatever you want to call it right there there's all kinds of approaches you know a lot of\nPeople say they got to go to church every every week to feel good and feel like they go into heaven ... and some people say they don't need that but they they feel right there so\nIf you don't feel right with you're so right now about how things could go maybe you need a little bit of a counseling maybe you need a little talk people go to counsellors uh they're having trouble in their marriage and you know to counsel so having trouble in their life maybe you want to talk to someone about how\nTo still use the stock market in ways that protects you from this potential great burst of a sort of like the balloon going off in the Nineteen thirties the hidden in ... that could occur\nBecause they've they've over or should I say extended the the envelope of this balloon right now to actually he could be\nFull of a flammable situation yeah\nAnd uh we don't really want to go down to the ground in flames whenever retirement and her dreams were\nAre about to occur so if you're in that point in time maybe you need to get into a safe mode or look at getting into say clothing still grow I'm not saying to not put your money where it doesn't grow um well I'm Talking about some good growth here but I'm Talking about being on a defensive mode\nIf you're getting is some age on you 'cause a lot of times people just don't know ... and they don't get ready and they think somebody else is watching after him and maybe not\nWell let me ask you this mhm so you are black vegetables right and you kinda out any kind of out in the country a little bit you know and then you homes around neighbors and you get out in the back\nThe thing Illinois I'm this is a top breeding I Know slavery\nI'm Sorry about that of course\nI'm with you or do you have to go in this campaign and uh we're at the state of the campaign hours down even though it did lead to this but looking here in the bottom line is that you know pay is but ... has been in politics thirty six years so that's about as long as I've been alive she's been in Washington for twelve long years it's become a party line liberal\nI mean whether it's immigration where she's offering the open borders bill with diet by died uh whether it's the judges you voted no on Justin Kavanaugh was all for the terrible smear that her party carried out you voted no on Gorsuch ... Supreme Court justices that or a McCaskill is and she's just terribly out of step\nWith the state of Missouri of what the people of the state voted for and that's why we're going to replace\nSo right now on this issue of this migrant mob I don't like calling in a caravan it does not now that doesn't really [laughter]\nIt doesn't really capture it in my view a lot of people of Missouri thinking about like a crush like this on the border I mean it's a ... it's going to be a crush and it's going to and it's going to cause a huge problem for immigration officials and for the national guard\nThat I think that the people in the very very worried about it I mean I as I travel all over the state I have I have people talk to me about it especially the last few days I mean this yesterday every stop I made all over the state people asked me they said what is going on and they all with the state of the girls but we have a president\nWho is strong and who is willing to take steps to defend the country on like the Democrats unlike Claire McCaskill who they're open borders policy the course or or to encourage this kind of lawlessness and it's kind of a threat to the country now to have Claire McCaskill of this threat\nOffering an open borders bill I I just can't think of anything work so I Can't think of anything all week I Can't think of anything that's more dangerous for months tutor for the country\nWell we knew a Josh look at the rest of America right now it seems that\nThey support for Donald Trump is growing and he said his highest point in his presidency which is stunning given how perpetually negatives the press is I mean it is a negative drumbeat coming out of almost every mainstream media outlet even with that\nHe's at forty seven percent which is higher than bronco bomber was or how important is the president in this race for you\nTo report\nThat I'm a very voted for Donald Trump by almost twenty points on that that is a huge huge margin in Missouri which is still a swing state and it's because people want to what they want a stronger America I mean people voted to rebuild our country that's what they were voting for months\nThese are rebuilding the country under good from Missouri You know we've got our lowest unemployment rate it decades and the state of Missouri job growth finally hitting new high we've got blue collar economic growth jump rope at a point in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd the state rural unemployment for all that we're finally starting to get those jobs back from overseas the airwaves grow but here's what scared folks that the Democrat Claire McCaskill want to take all that away throw it all in reverse reverse all the games and then go back to the policy of weakness\nOverseas weakness on our border and uh you know we just can't have that and that's what this election is about\nJosh has these if at all these undercover videos of Claire McCaskill Harris her and her staff is that resonated at all at the voters where people are are saying that worked for a while we have to kind of lie of the voters we can't really say what we really mean about\nA various issues\nI think what's been usually resident and you know people just have to to have a politician and especially a lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their face in the open up bond or back to see clear McCaskill on tape saying that she wants to take away the second Amendment rights you know these are constitutional rights\nThat belong to people by virtue of our constitution to hear her talk about I was to take those away from all by her staff talk about\nConcealing the donations from Planned Parenthood and other extremist abortion groups to\nTalk about the fact that well you know the McCaskill really agrees with Brock Obama on everything but she won't say that publicly because you know Missouri voters are are so close minded I mean it's a ... a staff was caught thing over and over and over again\nIt's really the condescension the contempt\nFor everyday voter is really remarkable and people are tired of that they want somebody who believes in the state who was not ashamed of our way of life in the state and it's going to go represented\nA Josh a when you look at the makeup of the Democrat Party today the\nPerpetual mob mentality that seems to be encouraged and even celebrated or by some of their top leaders or how does this you know I mean it seems like maybe it's just a big cities and this is happening it's not so much and\nAnd now in in places like Missouri but if he needs covered a lot and certainly certainly had socks and other networks is that on people's minds the president says mobs and not jobs and it seems like people just want things to calm down and government to work for them\nYou know I think that's absolutely true in Missouri I've you know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill is offering its chaos at home and weakness abroad and this this mob behavior it it is chaos that is ... and I think with folks watch mobs driving people out of restaurants screaming them down and public banging\nOn the doors of the U.S Supreme Court and shouting obscenities I mean this is not the United states of America or this is not civil democratic discourse I'm all for strong disagreement that's great that's the first amendment but\nTo try and shut down speech and harassed intimidate and even use violence against people I mean and have Hillary Clinton as you say Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder\nOut they're encouraging it as a quarter McCaskill you know she is she's going right along with it I mean she was happy to see these mob tactic employed that is not what the people in my state voted for that that is not who we are as Americans\nAre Josh I'm the concern I think a lot of conservative religious voters have is the social transformation of the country and the the idea that gender is something that is\nYou know that we should really celebrate these things in public schools and and obviously the conscience rides and the religious rights of many say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe how ... how are the social issues playing in your state this election cycle\nYou know the Missourians leaving the constitution and they believe in the first amendment First Amendment guarantees the freedom of religion or to churches to individuals and all this was something where I spent the most of my career I've only been in politics for two years\nYou've been in the ... and I know you don't grow up there [laughter]\nYeah yeah but most of my career as a constitutional lawyer\nAnd it's a religious liberty lawyer and you know the people they they are a fair minded people\nAh they you know we don't discriminate against anybody based on their religious views but you know what we believe in the importance of value safe and we believe that the importance of value of family and community and those things built around\nThe churches in our houses of worship and we want to see those protected and I think they have the again the left wing agenda which has become so hostile\nTo people who have a so hostile to religious liberties just like it's hostile to our Second Amendment rights just like to come off all the free speech I mean think about it what what the left wing of the really offered to you know you agree with us or you shut up\nAnd that is just not what the people of ice they want I don't hold his country\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for him of many many reasons obviously substantive reasons menu of the news on critical issues from crime to the economy and immigration so forth\nBut I'll tell you why I think you're going to win is because the New York times\nIs already writing ridiculous articles about about your office in turmoil first of all you show me an office that doesn't have personality conflicts and and uh\nAnd people moving in and out and departures and so forth but it's this is the best that they can do with you that oh well we are not well you know of us in a surprising number of ... perching departing staff from the attorney general's office\nI started reading this today and I was screaming laughing because it's just like they could say that about pretty much everybody knows office\nWe are definitely getting the Donald Trump treatment I Love your time from the liberal you know the state and I do I wear a badge of honor I mean you know and I by the way I'm not going to apologize but all for taking up\nGovernment bureaucracy that when I came to office I was on the first Republican uh twenty five years\nOr the office needed to be shake it up it needed to be made more efficient it needed to be a revamp and that's what we did and you know what a great result the I don't care for New York times likes it or not I promised I Would do this but the people but they're done exactly what I said I Would do and that's what I'll do the senator to\nNow mom I I just think it's I mean I and someone who's been written about so much Josh made on e just gotten a little taste of it compared to me but I read these things and I read them much differently than most people I just read between the lines like okay uh-huh mhm yeah right [laughter]

about it\nThey know this is a radioactive issue for them they know speaking of radioactive they know this is a terrible issue for the Democrats reporters worth their salt should force Democrats\nTo ask questions or what should we do with this caravan what should we do with all these people do you think they should all coming to America do you think they should all be released into America including women and children just to show up at a later date which they don't do\n... who do you think should pay for their health care [noise] do you believe that you are free schooling is what what needs to be done for anyone who gets a foot hold over the border though the Supreme Court ruled that that we have to do that\n[noise] but when is enough enough when when is when is the human tragedy

[noise] yeah I think we ought to scrap what we've been doing there shouldn't be a lottery system people who enter the country should be based on merit we should be selective on who comes to the country with regard to those who come across the border\nI Would say look you want to keep people together and keep families together do it do it within twenty four hours and send them back and the thing is is we have an immigration office apply to come in as far as refugee status what we've done is we've taken away all the rule\nClaim to be a refugee none of the rules apply so typically if you come in here and you can legally immigrate there are some decent prohibitions aren't getting on welfare\nAnd on getting on government assistance\nIf you're a refugee apparently all those things go out the window so everybody knows that when you come to be a refugee so you can get on welfare and get into government ... and this is something that should change I'm fine with\nEach year\nPeople that we can emit into the country now maybe we need and will make that decision each year but uh we can't allow just people just to to come across the border by the thousands\nI'm Talking to Rand Paul here on the lower ... shows Senator Paul what can you think um are the most important issues facing the country today given everything that we're seeing all the great\nAdvancement we've made in the economy the Republicans are leading by a historic margin in the handling the economy Seventeen point advantage in trade and the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll or those two issues are our math and plus it's for the Republicans in in a tough midterm cycle cycle normally\nDo what do you see especially coming from the Kentucky perspective [noise]\nI think the good news is overwhelming at all how scared by the media you know he often being carried away with all the Trump range but said\nThe good news is overwhelming we have an economy growing at just an amazing pays over four percent annual growth unemployment at historic lows the main thing I see as I go round Kentucky when I talked to plant managers as\nI said we have a shortage of workers a shortage of people who are drug free with work ethic and so the answer here is this is a time before but this is a time when we should convert or work programs and our welfare programs to\nHey there's a job down the street programs and I think if we were able to do that\nYou know we have a great future coming ahead and most of it's because and this is what Republicans off in Washington don't get they keep calling it tax reform and the president corrects them no it was a tax cut a significant tax cut will return money to his rightful owner leaves the money in the private marketplace and guess what\nThe private marketplace will boom when you leave money in the private marketplace and so\nAll of that has been great and I don't think we can emphasize that enough and I think in the election if they come to fruition that not only the cabin on the inside of the Republican base but there are reports that early voting in seven out of eight states that are reporting\nWhere people can uh decide how many are Republican an amateur Democrat the Republicans are are in a big upsurge with oh you're voting\nAnd which is is is you know music to my ears because Tom Styron Soros and others have really funneled an enormous amount of money into voter registrations on college campuses which are overwhelmingly I'm moving to the Democrat Party or a Senator Paul why should Americans\nCare about this Saturday killing of this ... cars show gay who was living in the United states he was ... or was he he was\nPreviously kind of a sympathized with the Muslim Brotherhood and he\nNow he was mourning the death of bin Laden although he thought bin Laden went off the wrong track and got to radicalize but media had been tied up on this story for you know a couple of weeks now\nI Would say that to the killing of ... by the Saudis is just one more ... of things that they do that are not good for America there's been over a hundred billion dollars over the last several decades a supporting the ... around the world that teach hatred of Christianity Judaism and Hindus\nThey're over ten thousand madrassas in Pakistan supported by them the ... network which is a group of\nA bad actors in Pakistan that attack our soldiers in Afghanistan they all the leaders of it went to um to draw a funded by the Saudi Arabians\nSaudi Arabians madrassas in Indonesia as it used to have a relatively moderate form of Islam is a big Islamic nation but there there's a growing faction of a ghost who now believe in violence against civilians\nTaught by the Saudis so the Saudis are bad\nI'd say it's all Iran Iran Iran we have to support the Saudis\nI'm not so sure that the Saudis are less evil than the uranium to tell you the truth the war in Yemen is going to drag us into another war in the middle east thousands of civilians are being killed\nSo the killing of the journalist I Would say is just one more item\nOf bad action by Saudi Arabia\nBut Saudi Arabia sent arms by the hundreds of tons of it into Syria\nTo ... an al ... they they they supported the worst and most extreme elements of the Sunni extremists in the Syrian civil war\nSo no I Can't think of a reason why we shouldn't be the hopping mad about this but what I've advised as we should quit selling them arms or should quit aiding and abetting them in what they're doing throughout the middle east and the world\nWell the administration and the president himself yesterday said you know they're and they're important partners of ours so in the middle east is that not the case I mean they've actually assist in American interest in the middle east is specifically I mean the way they were on which still is the largest state sponsor of terrorism\n[noise] yeah but I Would call the Saudis the largest state sponsor of radical Islam you know they really teach it throughout the world the people who came attacked us on nine eleven weren't Iranians they were Saudis\nIf you really look at worldwide terrorism is the Saudis and therefore the hobbit is that is being sent an export around the world [noise] so uh as far as arms they by sort of orange sure but I don't think the armed our military arms are or something like any other private entity like widgets or whatever\nOur armed or something unique we paid for by the taxpayer the F. sixteen is not something that\nIf we could get jobs by selling you have six team to China or Russia I Would still be against it because I'm not I don't see our arms trade as jobs program it's about our national defence and I think selling arms the Saudis actually puts it I said at greater risk\nIt increases or risk that Yemen is going to devolve into chaos in Libya before it in Syria and Iraq before that chaos is where terrorists breed so if we want to stop terrorists we need to quit aiding and abetting the Saudis and creating chaos\nA Dell a gym near the Saudi foreign minister responded to your view on the show get down and he said that\nI find it very surprising that some of these thousand miles away from the events that happened miles away no access to information and intelligence services to senator of all this is not in the oceans and the some of the nation\nI take a swing at that\nI'm not too excited to be lectured by some autocrats from a dictatorship you know the Saudis have three thousand people in prison right now without trial so he says oh we should presume the crown prince to be innocent until otherwise proven what about the three thousand people in your country that you've locked up in jail and you don't give a trial too\nSo I think it's pretty galling for him to take western standards our western standards a presumption of innocence and say oh we need to presume the crown prince to innocent\nIt's a dictatorship nothing happens over there without the crown prince being involved the Fifteen people that were involved with killing and dismay and bring this journalist\nApparently many of them are henchmen there travel with a crown prince when he travels it goes up to two people who their punishment now has been being fired\nTo chop ups or to the chopping up and the December meant other journalists\nAnd you get fired my guess is they're uh they're banished meant will be in royal exile somewhere with lots of money the lower level people they will probably executed an outlet talk to anyone because they would probably implicate the crown prince and this so now

I help today sir\nYes do I have a pretty quick question I'm with my employer I have two different retirement account and when I leave 'em I Will be busted obviously um should I convert them to a traditional ... or ... I'm right now there for one am for three B. and fidelity\nOkay um well the four oh one K. is after tax\nCorrect so that doesn't have any penalty took converted to a rough I always suggest as a general rule when you leave your employer take everything that's best enroll it into an Iranian good growth struck mutual far you're more accessibility more control and more options to pick from and they open market than you do\nBut you're right some examples that I Would not converted to a Roth if it's pre tax unless you're out of debt have your emergency fund and have some extra money to pay the taxes so that that creates but the four oh one hey you can go ahead and stick that into a rough it doesn't cost you a dime\nBecause there's already after tax money that's in there um yeah that could be some growth in there that how you don't pay taxes on possibly um but it probably wouldn't be much\nSo just you know ... are you out of debt [noise]\nUm I Will be I have about ten thousand dollars left on the phone but um by the time I make this transitional by the covered\nOkay well then the other question is when you're not going to have your emergency phone number ... so we're not we don't do anything to create St taxes so when you sit down with your smart best are pro roll it all over to Iowa raise\nA traditional IRAs unless you can move some of it to a raw fire right in similar mutual

evicted get that old ugly woman out of your house\nShe is not a good roommate you want her to leave Louis is on Facebook should pull a thousand dollars on a four one K. to do baby step one\nNo cash out of four O. one K. except to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure when you take money out of your four o one K they charge you a ten percent penalty plus your tax right\nNow that means if you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year household income your tax rates twenty five percent plus ten percent that means you just got charged thirty five percent interest in fact I mean it's not technically interest it's penalties indexes but you never borrow money thirty five percent interest to ponder baby step\nOne no no no no no no\nNo or would you use that to pay off debt thirty five percent hit no no well they told me on hold and twenty percentile that's all they're required to withhold but that's not the calculation of how much the government takes you in the teeth\nThe government keeps you in the teeth out of ten percent penalty plus your tax rate you do not carry shout retirement accounts\nUnless it's to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure of its save your home yeah or if you're so far in debt it's the only way you keep from bankruptcy yeah you would do that\nBut at that point you're beyond desperate you're in deep weeds you know but definitely not never cash it out to buy a car or you know this kind of stupid stuff that people do all the time no never never and I was one of those in Washington DC Hi Anna how are you\n[noise] I think I'm doing well thank you for taking my question sure um [noise] so Antonov insects my husband and I purchased a first home and to that and then eight and market crash and flash value of our house\nNow three years ago our family through and we bought a new home twenty percent down into ... years now and I'll first home it failed a lot more for worry about it for it and we\nWait a minute wait a minute that that's not economic there's something else going on I ... a few places in the United states of not recovered after twelve years would you buy a ... or what\nI I don't understand it either 'cause we live in

hundred and fifty K.\nA recent comparative market analysis by quality real estate agent says his house is worth three hundred grand\nOkay is that what you're telling me yes\nSo you must have done the

about sixty chaotic\nO salad crown wishes ballot it's crap\nIts worst house\nToday in twelve years it sucks\n[laughter] so you think we should wait for it we we just suck more [noise] All right do you that that can actually my question because right now we're at dating I babysat them respect here's the thing we\nDo three hundred thousand dollars in cash would you go by the house next door\nKnow why because this sucks\nThis neighborhood is not appreciating for some reason or another it's the world's worst rate of return meanwhile the rest of the nation dripped way down and his up twenty percent\nI I I agree with you I this is why I'm calling because I'm trying to decide if we can pay their rent out no and wait until okay\nNo it's a bad investment it's a bad neighborhood I don't know what's wrong here but I I mean a ... a house you pay three and fifty thousand dollars for in two thousand three kings six before the crash it goes down and it's not even recovered back to three fifty it mean that's a very unusual real estate market unusually bad\nAnd I don't want to invest in it and going forward and so I wouldn't keep it going forward take your take your loss and get out you bought a really bad place for some reason I don't know what's wrong but that's the worst numbers I've heard and I don't know when\nI mean everywhere else just about as recovered Florida went down the Knicks went down freak in Las Vegas crashed\nAnd has recovered you know I mean but there's some you know there's some parts of Detroit that habit but those are economic pockets but it's not an overall

this hour Cassandra is with us tied Cassandra how are you\nHow are you better than I deserve what's up in your world\nI just want to tell you first off that we thank you for what you do on these changed my husband and I\nI live has really changed um but right now we're on that baby step to I'm paying off our debt we have paid off thirty thousand dollars and we started in May of this year and go on and we are questioning whether or not\nTo we've had we have a rough I Roth IRA and requesting on whether or not to poll from it to pay off\nOne of our debt that we have um [noise] it's it's actually a travel trailer that we use with our children and we're wanting to keep it so we want to pay it off on and I just we were sitting here and we're like we don't know whether or not to pull from it or not but it would have allowed eleven years earlier\nUm we owe twenty seven thousand on it [noise] um we're getting ready to make a payment of five grand here at the beginning of November are we allowed\nFor a household name to a hundred and forty thousand\nOkay and um what are your car's worth\nUm we just recently paid off one of our cars it's worth about Fifteen thousand the other on the other one word and the other one is about thirty thousand\nYou have to money I don't mind me kind of knew too much to try to do things with wheels on\nThem yeah\nAll of that I Know we all know English and all the things with wheels on them go\nDown in value yeah and you make a hundred and forty thousand and you've got about eighty five thousand dollars tied up in rolling stock and um it doesn't make sense I mean you're going to get ahead financially as long as you run with that value system um you know\nOfficially went you know financial piece university my husband's read the books and thought of I I'm actually reading the wind your daughter\nOh here's the rule of thumb okay when you buy stuff that goes down in value you don't get rich\n[laughter] even even like if you don't realize that goes down in value you get really on rich [laughter] yeah\nThat's where you are you bought too much crap so you want to keep the travel trailer silver thirty thousand dollar car\nGet you to another caller and pay cash probably the travel trailer off you have too much tied up and things that are going to be worth half of what they're worth today in two years and then ... year old\nBecause you are placing value on those benefits that is absurd [noise] and you're making a decision using wrong critical thought\nOkay you're assuming that the only way to get excellent benefits and the only way to cover the issues that the benefits cover is to take less pay\nWhy don't we go with another option make more money was excellent benefits but see everybody is a dumb this down\nYou have to assume the only way that can be happy is make less money the only way I could get securities make less money the only way I could get benefits just make less money what do you always have to put make less money at the end of the sentences why can't you go I can make more money and be happy\nI can make more money and get benefits so you gotta look at it that way to start with ... and make more money but it's amazing that people think that they get there there's some kind of a trade off here it's a false it's a false it's a false logic\nIs actually an oxymoron but um it it's just it's bad critical thinking skills channel no no no no it's not okay okay okay just for that reason it's not okay is there a difference between a psycho score and an experience or Equifax score\nEquifax has been given a score it said we suck or you know released all of our data to the entire world [laughter] that's the perfect score I'm\nAn experience doesn't have a score now I'm ... I don't think either one of these have a separate scoring rather than fight though I don't I'm I'm not aware experience website doesn't show anything except psycho score on it\nOr maybe they have a program and I'm just not aware of it where there started their own score or maybe Equifax ... says I don't care and nobody cares what ... million more [noise] but um\nTakes up their former president who made like a hundred and eighty ... billion dollars for quitting a but um no I wouldn't worry about it I wouldn't worry about any of these scores by the way because they're all based on you borrowing money\nAnd so again it's a set of false logic it's too bad critical thinking 'cause the only way you get a high cycle scores to borrow money and why do you get a high score so you can\nBanks somewhere worshipping at the altar of a false God called fight go psycho is not your provider the only thing psycho will provide you with us the ability to borrow money which should provide you with the debt\nWhich takes your income which takes your ability to\nWin with money away just gone by\nTo lean on his own Facebook I Know life insurance is less expensive the younger I Am if I'm thirty two what is the best age to purchase term insurance what exactly does that cover\nDeath um\nI still have school that that doesn't matter\nUh you don't need life insurance unless someone is dependent upon your income for their\nAbility to eat so\n... ... ... if you are a mom\nThe income that you are making you should get term life insurance today and it doesn't matter whether you're thirty to forty two or twenty two if you're a mom and you're earning an income and your kids are counting on your income\nThen you wouldn't need about ten to twelve times your income on you and yeah it's a life insurance coverage death in statistically the older you are the more likely you are to\nDie so it gets more expensive to pretty simple math formula and so yeah\nTwenty thirty two is more than twenty two and less than forty two years old uh the the premiums are less so\nBut it's not that expensive to get Fifteen to twenty year level term insurance ten to twelve times your income on you and that is not a baby step that's a start right now go get it now and just check out Zander insurance dot com they'll give you a quick and easy quote\nAnd um\nYou know it'll be really easy for you to uh get dolled in

[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nFrom the headquarters of the solutions is a Ramsey show that is some cash is king and paid off home mortgage has taken the place of a BMW and as the status symbol on Dave Ramsey your host thanks for joining us America open phones that\nAAA eight to five uh five two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five Benjamin is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Benjamin how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call they sure what's up [noise] well I have a question for you I'm considered uninsured rubble and my term life insurance will expire next year I'm an R. E. F. U. class there are some of us are considered uninsured rubble\nAre one of my questions is what should we do instead of termites\nThe accidental death insurance in place should I go ahead and canceled it or keep it since I'm now can't get term insurance [noise] how old are you [noise] forty three and why are you not ...\nHistory of diabetes I'm no longer diabetic but I I just got that diagnosis removed but I have have that in the past five years of my history\nOkay have you checked with Zander insurance and see what they can ride true\n[noise] we're in the process of having them do that kind of aid to double check\nBroken on dry up or something yeah because you know every day that goes by you're going to be more and more in trouble in your situation and so that's great news says ... hopefully is a short lived a issue\nOkay because in other words I think I think you're gonna be able get insurance on just don't know exactly when or what is going to cost that's the other thing you gotta look at it or he could be unreasonable but I'm diabetes is a real tough\nDiagnosis for life insurance really tough so um anyway\nThe answer to your question overall is if someone's uninsured well yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental\nWould be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue um but otherwise I mean you know statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidental death as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kinda gimmick insurance is what it is a definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment and if you're a term ... is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nNo I have not I didn't know about those sometimes they do ah sometimes it's very very expensive um\nBut again you might be worth it or if you've got a non medical renewal it may just jump way up like triple or something once you're paying\nNow kind of thing um so what you have like a ten or twenty year term it's run out right twenty or turn when we first got married yeah okay All right you know that that's um\nYeah you would see you see it go up it just to buy a twenty year term at forty rather than at twenty obviously but in your case if we did a non medical renewal most of them have\nTo find out how you can help me that new talk nine three one dot com\nMainframe menial won't or news station so they want to be in\nThe hour they pay versus salary my my husband is transitioning to trick position where they're going to be given him a pay raise\nBut with that pay raise their I'm saying that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him into salary pay she usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week\nI wanted to make sure that when he they haven't given him an offer gadgets that when they do want it to make sure that how would you how would you recommend\nTo calculate whether\nThat the salary rate is comparable with for example the hours that he was working for and the pay that he would get what overtime\nWhat sounds like it would be simple you been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that and overtime correct correct and so what was his income last year including the overtime\nOr about forty thousand\nAnd how will that compared to the salary\nFound out that the kind that we don't know yet\nCars are going to the salary is ... if the salary is fifty that's a raise if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours or expect to be work it's effectively a pay cut\nRight\nYeah that makes sense it's like\nI like because we were I was kind of weird because it's just more of an wearing the ... member cheer mhm\nUm I I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was kind of\nVery yeah but but the question the question and it's not just more hours the question is is this a good deal for him apples to apples not a ... and ... and has he got the chance to move up in the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be moving into management condition\nNo but I mean further up later oh okay but let's say like I say they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary\nWhile we'd be dancing wouldn't we yeah\nOkay yeah 'cause that's like that's like getting paid a lot more\nAnd I'm working the same number of hours you know and it's like it's almost like he picked up more hours but didn't have to work on them you see what I'm saying but it but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did him a favor and it's a band and he gets paid forty but he's working in the same number of hours where he's working when he was making forty eight then that's not a blessing\nYeah it's just making sense to you yeah that makes sense\nIf it's even if it's forty eight to forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward potential okay long term it's a long term good career movies moving into leadership and the management and that's where he wants to head towards long term\nBut um you know yes but\nBut again you just compare it to last year's income so the whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand\nThe salary because that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently\nYou know I'm doing good they taking my call sure what's up\n[noise] uh well right now I'm a I'm a income about thirty one thousand dollars a year I got a fourteen hundred dollars in credit card debt\nA battle eleven thousand a student loan debt [noise]\nIt ah that that about six months ago was that Nineteen thousand [noise] and I've been working working hard down saved my money and [laughter] and then all of whom I as I can do it or not uh cooks right now I came up with the idea for an invention\nAnd I don't know whether to keep you know steam rolling my debt plan and doing all that are just you know kind of jumped ship and say hey this is something that could\nBe my future and potentially mhm\n[laughter] so [noise] I'm In a kind of want a young lady and financial advice from you know what to do with the remaining then I have ... and you know my aspirations [noise] because I'm In the process I've been paid into a get a v a home loan now is just about there so [noise] any advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciated\nRight well I'm going to avoid buying a home until I got the debt cleared the only question is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now because we don't need to make a bunch of money five years from now we need some money today\nOne of 'em twenty thousand dollars a day so the invention you came up with as a physical product\nYes sir and say uh odor the odor either slash a mold a little small machine that um [noise] people getting on their own\nOkay and you've made one\nUh I ... made a very um rudimentary proud of the ... the next the next phase I've got is like either the at the end of my rainy day fund has started coming into my regular cash flow and like mine a computer and get my three D. modeling\nAnd get me a couple of silicon prototype so I can go you know take it to a you know take the next level and then when I Want to do\nSo again Dr jump off my my debt plan more do I change my invention [laughter]\nOkay um well what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between I mean you could just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot of money to be spent on something like this\nAnd if you're a billionaire and you you know you ... what you would do is you would build a couple of 'em and you get them out there and test them and make sure that they work and that there was a market for it before you went into production\nHum because you don't go into production on prototypes that our own tested or from an R and D standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no market for it not been able to sell it\nBecause you can let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your basement or if you had unlimited funds ever be able to sell them\nYou know ... I'd like trying to ah continue to do with the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in the in the property and a commercial applications\nAnd let's say let me give me just let's just make up a pretend example okay\nHere would be like your ideal thing you build one or two in your garage and you convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the ... the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works and if the idea works then and when\nGoing to want you to his place in order for ten of 'em or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside to test it and then if a place that order that just plays the deposit with large enough to build the order\n...\nAnd it finds itself\nOr do you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order was enough of a deposit to fill the manufacturer your first order out\n[noise] the thing I should dial down my rather than just an all my extra capital towards paying off my credit card debt and I've been on that\nI don't think you have time and much capital on this you've already you already built one in the garage yeah build another one okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right\n[noise] well as the person that but I I did see I'm a perfectionist I wanted to be you know a good the compound it\nThat's it so prominently there are no protections [laughter] very they're very purpose of a prototype despite all the crap that's broken [laughter] you're not going to get it perfect you're going to put it out there in the in the marketplace\nIs going to kick it around and you're gonna learn form and function changes and form and function changes in this which has to be on that side of this which has to be made out of this that and you're only going to learn that if you beat up about a hundred of them but let's get\nTwo of 'em in somebody's restaurant in there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um\nYou know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the um and then they give you enough money [noise]\nAnd there are a deposit for the initial order for you to do your manufacturing\nAnd basically you got almost nothing out of pocket except your brain power and your sweat\nA lot of these things get off the ground or the way a\nProduction or somebody's proven\nThe marketplace the actual photo side\nWay so stupid stuff so go easy man\nGo easy listening today Ramsey show\n\n\n\nFor years and one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do a live event in our city\nWith a radio show and book tours in our growing company and family time I wish I could be more places but it's just physically not

I got to tell you the dentist is not just having property it's where it is a in this course the Palestinians and the Israelis are truly want more they are because it's the holy land that's it's where\nJesus and everything else began for them and they don't want to move to Kansas City or Iowa or Nebraska or anything like that we've got the land available there's no doubt about that but it's not just about land a part of the issue is fighting over the holy land itself Sam I Want you to take that question\nUm there's land but if not their land and um [noise] um I I think trying to federal um where people go at this point is a ... that's not going to happen\nIs way way too late I'm if I'm Wondering if you should have her head um you know the the second burrito I'm forty years after you've had the fifteenth slice of pizza I I I think what's important to understand about the Arab Israeli conflict\nIs that the experts the of the state department diplomats and everyone has been using a formula that um\nYou know it all the the Israelis and the Palestinians\nCan be ... and negotiate a peace like everyone else and they're missing what I Believe is a critical point and that is that the mathematical equation that they're working on is flawed\nAs the state of Israel was um a lot of creative the Israeli DNA dictate the Jews never again be forced to um to do anything at the point of a gun I'm through force\nAnd the Palestinians DNA because of the establishment of the state of Israel in Nineteen forty eight warrants demands that there'll be some sort of military victory some sort of um he would dream a moment of raising the flag\nWhere they can say that their ... their opinion there equals that they've achieved they've achieved parity\nAnd both both sides um in in how they approach the world and how they approach their very very small neighborhood um are are bent ... patients are doomed to fail so\nPerhaps what might be the lives of course of action for is the change of the mathematical equation and to try something different to try something where I'm different sorts of ... of landmarks and while those can be\nAnd to this thing that really hasn't been attempt to\nBrian in Indianapolis Brian go ahead sir hey George good morning hey\nHey listen ah name what about what a mess over there in the middle east and and ... than it used to ride all the war is wrong or no good over there or outside of Israel and look at all the American blood been spilled over there over the decades and it just seems like nothing has changed but my question is\nUh William Buckley they've forgotten the history that nobody you know really remembers\nBut if he gave that secrets in I don't know you know he did or not was there any trickle down collateral damage to the field officer of the CIA that were out in the field or from the information that he might have given up\nAnd keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off the air and got to give you that question\n[noise] I'm sure a good question Brian uh answer your question is uh uh at the time or the agency the CIA um\nCould not take any more chances meaning ah in essence they they removed all of this personnel assigned to the station or got them out of a country ace up a they had to shut down or their source network a and anticipate to the entire source chain that that had been compromise there\nOr they had to shut down safe ounces ah where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill or had disclosed that uh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets\nAnd so here you have a uh the CIA the CIA point man and Lebanon that have access to everything\nOr what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the intelligence service for example\nA Kenyan horse trader swap with a let's say of the Russian KGB at the time [noise] so those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario and you shut down everything so ah was ah operations compromise or\nA operations were certainly shutdown stopped a until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are\nAnd then you have to restart a your entire um human collection network a which is never easy\nSam what's happening to Lebanon today what's the situation there\nWell I'm a Hezbollah is perhaps the most powerful political party in the country while I'm ...

final segment with red Britain than Samuel Katz their workers go be rude rules are website linked linked up at ... dot com for I don't want to get your take on these ... situation of course and\nOf course the U.S Saudi royals lied about the case or in the beginning a truly was killed at the consulate butchered uh yeah I guess because of what his uh his writings were about the royal family and about Saudi Arabia\nBut she's my gosh what's your take on that\n[noise] like goodness Georgia I can never remember another incident like that on a diplomatic a facility\nIn the history of time uh now I'm sure the Russians live possibly ah ah disposed of some bodies the a similar methods that we are just not aware of just knowing how the KGB operates in this arena but ah I just uh I cannot imagine how\nA this operation was put put together\nA to actually do this or\nInside a diplomatic facility or with all the eyes and ears that are on every diplomatic facility in the world\nAre you certainly could could have thought of a\nA a much better operation and and\nSo uh either it was done with the purposeful intent to resonate\nUh although it or how it appears that this just was a a a tremendous fiasco and uh I I certainly don't think we've seen the last of this now the curious part to George with this is\nA based on some of the research we've done here at strapped for a there appears to then a few other a Saudi princes that have disappeared too so um\nSince then since the royal prince basically took over\nA correct a and before a this incident uh and stay on both so\nUh this just might be part and parcel to ah Saudi a outreach and covert action a to a target and eliminate a dissidents or any enemies of a of the royal family but uh uh it's certainly an unprecedented a mess\nBecause when he came in with his daughter base when his father basically said hey you're going to be in charge here uh didn't he put a lot of boils away at the Ritz Carlton are in Riyadh and basically held them as hostage\nOr if he did and you know you get back to a you know the the CIA director uh is round or or just arrived there for meetings or\nA which is always very interesting because those meetings never happened in a vacuum or I Would not be surprised to see a some sort of a a effort behind the scenes to to try to make sense of what took place and and to move forward\nWhere it's you know behind the scenes or you know the intelligence services just go about their business\nAnd um because you know the the world doesn't shut down with threats with liaison work and uh and the curious part there is you know the Saudis ah for all their dysfunction and chaos ah there's still an intelligence provider\n... that that gets funneled into the to the big intelligence community so uh it it it certainly is a a fiasco though\nIt's like a partnership with a double isn't it\n[noise] well most relationships with governments are a time [laughter]\nYeah I'm a front side to say and it's just the nature of the business uh you know some\nA rock along steadily without uh any hiccups like with our five eyes relationships um but you know those are at times working smoothly as a as most people think\nAh because I remember a you know there are no friendly intelligence services so that's the one mantra that you learn and and basic agent school\nIs a there are no friendly intelligence services and each nation state is going to operate and what they feel is from the ... of their country\nThen you're more cars shrug it apparently was the nephew of the late Saudi arms dealer Adnan ... uh there was so the you know there's been this power group within the royal family for years what what did he right that was so devastating that they want to kill him over\nWell that's the fascinating part I was talking to a couple of our ah Saudi analysts this morning here in the office and uh one of the analysts actually had a went in and watched him at a in a local speaking event\nUh this is an individual that are really wasn't that high profile ah and you probably could have lifted you know a dozen others that are more vocal against\nThe I mean he's more well known now dead and then he was alive\nWell exactly and you know was at one of these cases where are you know you look at what the Russian what putting in the KGB did going into the u._k. and and taking out scribe Paul when ... you know the poisoning or you know so uh you know due to these intelligence services see these\nA nation state moves like this\nAnd say well heck why can't we do this too\nI I mean it might boiled down to being something as simple as that\nYeah it's crazy and Fifteen people and apparently they're going to war ... most of them which is interesting because of the big are they going to rat on the person who said get this done for me and I think we all know words leading a or are they going to keep quiet and the hope that they get leniency and get out of prison and a year or two\nWell and you don't want to be in a Turkish prison that's that's the one given\nYou know that's true too that's true to Tom in the Bronx will it's going to start at Tom go ahead\nI like to save their lane is a horrendous caper is Yemen\nI mean it gives the United states where every ugly face and name and how can you uh how can it be said that they want peace between Israel and Palestinians\nWhen they have this when they have these terrible stories going on one\nFor another if I were in charge I Would say well maybe you can take ... and make it a temporary of God when the over the was not for oil and that would go much for silver but for the sake of humanity to stop\nThe ... from uh\nSending missiles into Israel and Israel bombing\nWell ... is it that way and then there's another aspect to this story they ... they took I they they took Libya and they made him is headed to Libya\nAnd in the ... that they should go back there and retake the area in the creative same government for the Libyans\nI well I think they tried that Tom but it's just sailed miserably so far printing Sam you of course wrote books on Benghazi that horrible situation there\nA coffee of course there was no Boy Scout we hated the guy he was a terrorist and all of a sudden after Reagan bombed them killed is one of his wives and a little kid or you went straight gave up his nukes and his new planning and everything else what do you think of that whole situation for it\n[noise] well uh first uh you know the state department has a long history of tragedy I've I've lived through a lot uh\nAnd uh you look at bin ... I\nI'm a you know they they have done a tremendous course correction or the organization mild outfit is hired more agents ah they've they've now train they now train and protect with buildings on fire\nUh they've worked with empty and why to the villa protocols for that as an agent or I was never trained at the state department or as to how to do that in a smoke filled environment so there's been a lot of lessons learned in a lot of changes made and protection\nA ... he was a mess I mean ... Stevens never should have been there on September the eleventh\nOr as the chief of mission of the president's representative to to Libya uh they pretty much can do what they want and he decided he wanted to go and he was there and he shouldn't have been and um\nThe agents got overwhelmed and you know certainly the the CIA um security support team were heroes you know they came and uh and and got everybody out of the special mission compound there but uh\nUm it's just a a another long list of disasters that has happened and and [noise] um let's let's hope that we don't see any more on the horizon\nHow many Libyans storm our embassy\nUm than do you recall the exact number I I don't remember off the top of my head revering report\nFrom a rift there between the in in a couple of hundred of 'em were\nThing we we all really like\nThe ... local local local Seoul [noise] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa [noise] um\n[noise]\nOn the phone call\n[noise]\nOne find him on\nThe on the Web site from my side of the show but I Do\nBad as long as you love me go\nAh\nGet on that moment when when you\nOnly have about a ...\nA lot\nMe me me\nThey're ah\nThey're like wow\n\nAt all not at all in one way or the other side of the ... law abiding can manage\nSomething you know we\nWent along\n\nRare na\nRon I'm a little while I don't know where to draw\nLa\nLa la la la\nNa\nNa\nNa na\n\n\n\n\n\nNa na na\nNa\nNa na na where\nGod no\nFive dollars which is why I think oh\nOr um\n\nOr\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster control the W.

and and helping you know we're going to give people money they should at least fall in line with what we're asking of them\nAre other stuff we didn't cover yesterday didn't get to but need to I'm a very important Supreme Court ruling the Supreme Court or the United states\nThis is why we elected Donald Trump\nThis is why we elected Donald Trump is because the Supreme Court is going to change in the collection of the United states of America the way\nIt's structured the way it's structured\nBut in other words article three judges are losing their power under Donald Trump powers being restored back to its constitutional premise\nThat the power to make and create laws vests and the legislature is executed by the executive branch the presidency\nAnd all the executive branch agencies and the judiciary is just there to sort of call balls and strikes they don't get they don't get to do with the I've told you guys there's one of the great shame that we've allowed to be perpetrated on this country one of the great scandals we've allowed to be perpetrate on this country\nIs that a single district court judge an article three judge a lowly district court judge cool position you know no no

see 'em up close and Mr saying man's locations misnamed mattress superstorm Eighteen years voted the best mattress store right here in Montgomery there's a reason for that reason for that Ninety minutes till the top of the hour\nA Nineteen Minutes till the top of the hour I'm looking at a second ago\nMhm\nI'm part where among clean up the stuff from yesterday 'cause there were a few more things from yesterday uh actually no I'm not you know what I'm going I I Know exactly what I'm going\n[noise] the more I learn about this ... deal the more I realized everybody's been ... everybody's been defrauded by this thing every single person has been to fraud or by this thing um\nYou know workers showed ... son was the other day anybody want to know\nYour ... the the the the alleged a journalist who was nothing more than a pro al ... pro Muslim Brotherhood a pro turkey pro deep stay United States operative you don't want to know where his son was he's the one that was allegedly killed by the Saudi hit squad\nOr just a just a routine journalist chicken ... and you know just a nice guy\nWorked for the Washington Post nothing nothing weird about the Washington Post um his son\nHis son\nWas with Mohammed bin Solomon the crown prince of Saudi Arabia taking pictures they were shaking hands with one another\nHis son's been barred from leaving the country but they were they're shaking hands with each other photo op and uh and it's out of government is arrested Eighteen people including Fifteen that turkey identified as being responsible for that\nAnd you don't you haven't read that on TV have you you probably haven't heard that they've all been arrested I've got a list of who all they are here\nTurkish investigators identified Fifteen as an Eighteen total a U.S officials last month so they were revoking the visas have Twenty one man suspected in the killing\nTurkey has video footage and and surveillance footage of these Fifteen minute they've identified coming into the country making their way to the\nConsulate\nI Do think it's hilarious by the way\nThat turkey basically had to admit they had to constantly under surveillance both bugged video and audio in order to prove that the guy died\nI mean what does that do for Saturday Turkish relations you know you're not supposed to bug your your ah your neighbors constantly on your soil is supposed to be their sovereignty at their embassies and consulates but turkey here's admitting no no no we had it but\nWe had to wait another video and audio surveillance inside so we know everything that's going on inside [noise] uh most of the guys arrested were from the intelligence military or security services not surprisingly\nI'm\nIn a lot of them were close associates a crown prince Mohammed bin Salman I don't think that should be surprising either or he is for all intents and purposes the ... the head of Saudi Arabia\nHe is the guy in charge over there and he is not going anywhere by the way I don't care how much pressure they put on these things he's not going anywhere and I'll explain why in a second ... he's not going anywhere\nTo get that thought out of your head I know you globalism corporate is a dying to get rid of Mohammed bin Salman because he's a Donald Trump fan I Know you guys are dying to get rid of the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman because well a very very very he murdered a journal is no he didn't\nKnow he didn't\nHe murdered aid at an American deep state operative or at least friendly deep state friendly guy who is pro al ... pro Muslim Brotherhood and one of the overthrow of the Saudi crown prince sound familiar an operation to overthrow the\nNot duly elected in ... case but the\nSovereign government of a given country sounds like exactly what was going on here under Donald J drop in the intelligence\nCommunity Saudi Arabia just doesn't put up with it they'll kill you we don't have that luxury here in the United states we gotta do process and they will kill you hopefully hopefully\nYou know I'm not a big fan of the death penalty but coups our war in in ... people die you kill people to protect your sovereignty and all that is what war is you kill people to protect your sovereignty\nAnd I'm telling you\n\nThat was Saudi Arabia did\nThey didn't kill this guy because they didn't like him but killed him to protect their sovereignty anyway you go through this list of people here Salah al ... tiny I mean you're never going to recognize\nAny of these names sounds like you just pulled some postpone out of your alphabet soup and [noise] and just got some letters ... through a\nLot to baggy but these guys are these guys are are are heavy hitters you know in the Saudi say it'll be interesting to see whether or not they're actually held accountable or whether they're kind of given a slap on the wrist\nVery very man you sound kind of like you were pro Saudi Arabia and as I kind of am to be honest with you I'm not said this guy's dead I don't think people should be dead I Wish they'd in prison to but I'm not saying\nI Am ...\nAnd around the world the global is in the corporate is trying to change governments to suit their interest so they can profit\nThis this ... he was directly involved with the former crown prince the guy who wanted to be the crown prince that the the current king removed and replaced with Mohammed bin Salman mom and been Solomon wants to modernize Saudi Arabia\nHe wants women have rights he wants them to be able to drive he wants to their their state owned company to be on the New York stock exchange he wants to Saudi Arabia to be a basically westernized country\nAnd these other people don't want it they want to be able to rape women whenever they want to instill in them if they complain\nBecause they're backwards twist to people they want to be involved in globalism and corporate says they want to be involved in the corruption mental Hammond bin Salman Khan wants to take the place straight\nAnd that's why they don't like him he's not willing to finance their global agenda anymore they've lost the Saudi royal families buying corrupt politicians all over the world in order to advance the corporate interests\nOf certain individuals and they're frustrated with it that's why there's this coordinated effort on every news channel all over the world we got to get to the bottom is we've got to get to the bottom of this guy's we've gotten to the bottom of the bottom has gotten too you can't keep scraping you're there\nYou're hitting the bottom of the barrel you're there and the reality is you don't like the answer because he was killed to stop the threat of globalism from taking back over Saudi Arabia that's why he was killed\nThat's why the Washington Post hired him in the first place anybody wondering why this Saturday dissident as a a regular column in the Washington Post\n\nBasically an organ of the deep state the Washington Post is anybody wondered that by the way\n\nHow they ended up with with that that arrangement I did very early on what do you mean Saudi dissident has a regular column in the Washington Post why why doesn't make any sense to me\nI wandered it I don't know why nobody else wanted it\nBut I'm not I'm not too worried about it but in a second we get back I Want to talk to you about what Donald Trump had to do what all the different considerations were\nBecause this thing is not as straightforward as the global as in corporate isn't leftist media want you to believe when I get back I'm going to detail kind of a step by step process of what Donald Trump has had to piece together to prevent a complete global meltdown of the economic system the intelligence system\nNow you see that secretary Zinke he just yesterday talking about the United states producing fourteen million barrels of fuel a day starting in twenty twenty that we need more refineries to reach that goal well guess what those refineries are being built right now in the Gulf states ride around Saudi Arabia under their control\nAnd they can't build him here because the liberals won't let refineries we built the United states anymore so we have to build 'em over there so we got to be nice to Saudi Arabia in order to allow the refineries to be built\n\nNow the president has to thread the needle on all this he doesn't need Congress imposing stupid sanctions over the death of some fight journalist he doesn't need anybody cutting off the sale of the military equipment that the Saudis are purchasing\nHe doesn't need sanctions that'll satisfy these war mongers in Washington talking about Rubio Lindsey Graham Bob Corker Bob Corker can't get out of there fast enough of it\nAnd he doesn't need sanctions so severe that the Saudis start reducing their production of oil because if that happens is the price of oil skyrockets doubles probably overnight over a hundred dollars a barrel maybe a hundred and twenty countries like Russia and others that are exporting field\nThey'll be happy but countries like China and India\nWill turn to Iran who will be offering the oil to those countries enemies at a discounted rate\nAnd those countries will say to hell with Iranian sanctions so if you want Iranian sanctions if you want of reform in Iran if you're tired of Iran being the state sponsor of terrorism you got to get through the November elections\nYou gotta keep Saudi Arabia pumping oil you can't have war mongers putting a bunch of sanctions on Saudi Arabia and you can't have people demanding Mohammed bin Salman step aside\nThat's the needle Donald Trump is threatening right now\nAnd that's why the global corporate leftist pushing so hard on Donald Trump to do something do something to do something about this that the journals nobody gives a damn about this guy now he may have been killed by those people for all we know\nNobody gives a damn about those people they're just using it because the Saudis and the Trump Administration are creating a completely new global order I completely new world order and they're sitting back every day those two are cooperating they're setting globalism back a year\nI mean there's that it's been set back decades already\nI mean they'll said don't reset the clock all the way back to zero if they can get through January together if the Republicans hold the house and Senate\nAnd Mohammed bin Salman is still in control of Saudi Arabia in January Iran will be brought completely to its knees now you see the urgency of the twenty fourteen election at twenty eight in elections now you see\nYou see the urgency for the the global as freak out over Mohammed bin Salman this is about the restructuring of the entire World War [noise]\nI play in Nineteen Seventy nine for reasons because remember what happened in Nineteen Seventy nine smashing focus [noise]\nThis is about resetting Iran [noise]\nTrump is going to do it probably is going to do\nBut this is ... I'm a lesser man would have rolled over and die with the pressure of the global as corporate as a put on this president\nWe elected the right man threat to the right time and going to get the job done\nWe're going to get the job a lot you know what they threw along segment of late for the spring will be\nBad [noise]\n\n[noise]\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center this is W.

kinds of stuff but generally speaking pike robe did this recently mhm they knew ahead of time what they were going to do ... they had a plan already in place but to appease the community\nThey invited the community and to have their say and it didn't matter what the given you said they were going to do whatever they were going to diminish or a and then they just pulled the trigger and did what they were planning to do in the first place and is that kind of what Montgomery has in mind no they'll get jealous wheel is what's gonna happen and when we don't\nWe don't have that in mind a at oh I

[noise] I'm a reality I'm I'm I'm I'm always on the opinion that if we don't have people here locally that are willing to develop in certain areas then I think we need to see you know people come in and find the outside\nWell he had one quick thing Robert because if if you only used outside developers then people would say you're using all these outsiders are perfectly capable confident people here in town to turn your back on on these are local folks who are invested in the city they live in the city why wouldn't you use them\nSo everyone I mean I think it's a it's a tough situation is a delicate balance\nIt is it is definitely a delicate balance but but yeah I mean if if we if people here locally won't do some things and then I think at at that point in time is when you look to the

someone takes me a minute ago and um\nSaid why do you not believe these suspicious devices were were intended to be enough areas I'm Talking about if you if you're not said seeing the news a former President Obama former President Clinton\nUm\nApparently explosive devices showed up at their residences and an explosive device may have also shown up at the CNN headquarters in in New York ... why why beer and why why would anyone have sent these if it wasn't for nefarious purposes guys this is exactly\nWhat they want you to believe Donald Trump supporter would do\nWeeks before an election\nThis is what they want you to believe that Donald Trump supporter with two weeks before an election tried to murder former presidents and killed news anchors\nUnless\nThose suspicious devices were planted within like a foot of the president and were moments away from going off I don't believe I absolutely refuse to believe they were legitimately place I I just refuse to believe in\nWhat ... what what political point are you going to make by blowing up of Clinton's mailbox what political party\nAre you going to make blown up Clinton's mailbox it just doesn't make any sense it doesn't make any sense so that's all I'm going to say about it until I get more information I don't believe that vice president Pence is speaking right now addressing it or will let him sort of\nA set the tone I guess but I I just I refuse to believe that um other news Reuters reporting yesterday Paul Manafort said nothing damaging and the motor interviews or Robert Mueller has oh that reminds me I Need to get to something as I got too much on my mind\n\nI get to the store and say a Rudy Giuliani who obviously represents Donald Trump in this Russia probe told Reuters yesterday that he had spoken to Manafort's lawyers\nManafort is not saying anything negative about Trump because there's nothing to say that's their that's their position that's their position or he said that he's\nTalking to the special counsel Robert Mueller quote about a lot of things none of which are incriminating with regard to the president that's Rudy Giuliani's quote to keep that in mind as you're left his friends tried to get you to believe that there's some massive operation underway to take out the president's just not\nNot possible where was the other thing that I wanted her to the ... the\nI'll get to it here's this here's this morning who is [noise] the more anybody around here [laughter]\nUm I had a question a bearing about um the bombings and all of that\nYou know let me call you back there and some just happened perfect I came out to me [noise] well that's odd you called me and then you've got to go that's okay I'm willing to I'm willing to put up with an eighty for what's going on like\nNothing I'm looking for a particular story that I was just reminded me when I was talking about the manner for deal and I find that to my ...\nWell let me do this one guy and they are going back to the bomb deal yeah it it I'm with you it smell fishy and think about how it started it started with a oh George Soros yeah and the first story that I heard was that the\nUh there was a a a package found in his house and painting a bomb bombs God detonated it and the ... I was like okay whatever\nWell then I heard a more detailed story it says they packaged worship as how they opened the packet following bomb carried it to the wood and and the bomb squad that night now let me run this scenario Bob ... held\nA packet shows up at your house you open the packaging the eyeball\nAre you going to pick a bomb up and carry it away from your house into the woods or you gonna run like hey\nCalls\nI'm going to run like hill in call somebody\nOkay well I I thought I wanted to make sure I wasn't the only one that about that story sounded fishy\nNo it's ... let me tell you on TALK fishy it's fishing on top of fishy ... here's the deal do\nIf you if you eighty four and wanted to send a message to the Obamas Clinton's and CNN [noise] do you send a bomb that doesn't mean that night no no no you're bomb goes off right\nWhen you open the lead to see what's in there\nYeah it does nobody remember the Unabomber and the only one that remembers Ted Kaczynski you know I talked to Ted Kaczynski brother one times I tell you that I I assumed\nThat Ted Kaczynski was dead at the time he was he was state not yet gone to glory and uh\nI talked to his brother and his brother came as when I was at Penn State his brother came to do a a speech again apparently Ted Kaczynski skills are still alive I looked him up but his brother came to do a speech on the death penalty and how he was against the death penalty\nAnd um maybe being anti death penalty I decided to show up to see what ... what his arguments were and and he talked a lot about his brother in the case against in ...\nAnd um and this was a bad actor keep in mind this is the guy who was\nRunning all over the place and and trying to blow people up and and you know I mean he was not a good guy by any stretch imagination\n[laughter] um but you know if you could if you could make a compelling argument that not even Ted Kaczynski could should get the death penalty then you could make a pretty good argument that almost nobody else can get the death penalty 'cause he's a pretty pretty bad actor [noise]\nUm it was a really fascinating discussion his brother was totally worth it I kind of expected his brother to be a little out there not only with it but anyway the reason we know who Ted cause is\nRight there's bombs went off and and that's that's the first thing I thought about what I saw this wait a minute says because the headline on Fox News suspicious packages send to Obama's Clinton's CNN and now they're saying the office of Debbie Wasserman Schultz also got one why is not a single bomb going off\n\nWhy why is not a single bomb going off that doesn't make any sense to me I refuse to believe that's reality\nWell in in in his my recollection of here in ... you know news stories are about who spacious package there generally either fake bombs that they end up finding but they're transporting knees and moving them and different by any of that out of it just\nAnd like you said I mean it may be somewhat job out there is actually do and they asked him I'd be like just failed ignition one on one and bomb making class or something and they're just not the triggers are riding on but it\nIs some something's weird why why not do this if you're mad at the at the dams why not Davis and staying there in the campaign in ... you're if you're just that upset at the Obamas are the Clintons or\nOr the Democratic party they than if you're just angry with him why why why do it now that my extent\nI agree wholeheartedly I agree I mean I I completely agree wholeheartedly this this this doesn't pass the smell test to me that's why midnight in passing I actually didn't mention it for like an hour and a half or after the news broke like an hour after the news broke\nUm but\nIt it I don't know I don't know if someone said to have a sneaking suspicion the Clintons don't even have a mailbox people pick up and scream their mail um that's true and and and the better point is made by the same person just assume it's actually my own goes anyone think these people actually checked through mail do you think Bill Clinton wandered down to the mailbox in his in his robe\n[laughter] he's laid down and do you think he\nRuns down there to pick up the New York times and check the mail\nYou know I mean ... what is it with his house slippers in uh in his room no you know in his boxer shorts\nCome on yeah\nThat looked like just escaped a mental institution\n\nI I'm with you I'm with your brother and I got a question that last time I said I said that before I thought about last time I said there's somebody sent me an email to the station apparently you're not allowed to say that\nPeople in mental institutions wear robes and look crazy well if that's true\nThen why does every movie portrayed mental institution people all wearing robes I just thought I'm not I'm not I'm not saying that they know I'm not I'm not trying to way back into the discussion but it's something I didn't get a chance to say last time somebody complained about it if that's true why why why isn't always the betrayal\nUm but I don't trust anybody right now except Donald Trump that's it I don't trust anybody I'm\nTom artwork there yeah I don't drink but Graham where I Do appreciate go thank you yeah are you you want to know why all this is happening\nYou want to know why guy like your mark a show ... killed if he was killed at all you want to know why bombs are being planted\nTo try to throw off the election you want to know why the Democrats are doing everything that they're doing to try to make sure Republicans don't pick up seats in the house and Senate is something I hadn't played in a while but I I Want you guys remember in the midst of all this why we did this hour\nIs about

B. A. R. joint base Andrews which is sort of in suburban Washington if you will across the river say your point is well taken they'll\nBut in this case the screening system was effective\nAnd stopping these packages from getting on to their ultimate destination and and it's also important\nBecause the devices were told a are intact and that really can be a gold mine in terms of investigators trying to understand whether it was one or more individuals involved whether they can track a the components of that device to a specific location it's amazing what they are able to tell 'em that way\nAnd then also it has come through the postal system sort of tracking it backwards on to the source but again what has the attached to my contacts this morning is the number of suspicious packages coming and

fingers\nAre unfortunately all the DNA showed all we can get from it was it was a male so it was a male individual but based on the fact that Mike had\nScratched marks on his neck you know you you can link those two things together um the gun did have fingerprints on it of course and you got to do the fingerprint stuff out so it was sent to to to forensics for fingerprints fingerprints were the mothers\nApril's fingerprints we're on the gun and they were in a defensive posture so either she was holding the gun and it went off or she was trying to maneuver the gun that would be the argument and one way or the other so [noise] you know the the the fingerprints did not turn out\nJesse so there was no blood splatter on judge interest in it that it was the mother show would have a mother she was shot I mean she she she so my shot his wife well there's there's we the evidence we have\nSupports three possible conclusion ... none of which we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt where is the evidence supported the conclusion that that um when I shot April and then committed suicide if we can prove that beyond a reasonable doubt\nThan I Would say that way and and Jesse would no longer be a suspect that would be the end of the case\nI don't have sufficient evidence to prove that it was a murder suicide idol has fish was proved that it was a murder that Mike murdered April and Jesse shot his father in an altercation after that\nOr that Jesse shot both of them I don't have enough evidence to prove any of the three alternative theories in either of the evidence that we have supports all three theories so it puts you in the situation\nOr one theory would be we can go ahead and try the case in ... the jury decide said to heck with it or let the judge of the jury decide and but in my view we are\nWe're not doing our job that's our responsibility to make those calls you know uh you know I don't want to make twelve people in ... county make that tough decision and live with it um

now that doesn't mean that my lawyer says he's innocent he's saying I just don't believe I can convict him based on this evidence and I don't believe this evidence\nSupports the conclusion that he did

Bogle with the lagoon made is every person has ever had I've taken it and it was kind of I'm not sure which ones do it that way\nIt's it's great it's you know it's great to be able to use the local

absolutely fantastic Alabama wagging you definitely should check them out they are amazing\nLevel would you let me start burger so good did they do a steak Sosa yeah it does take some time at the

he's usually out there\nAre some new today like that but I didn't let me or I mentioned this to you and somebody had asked me and I want to tell want you to tell the audience about this can you guys do ...\nI guess a catering from the cafe and from others yourself\nSo on the cafe barge so if you're like a law firm and you're looking for sandwiches for a meal to eat the a lunch meeting to say that\nYou actually could see more of the cafe catering 'cause\nYou know of course we do both of those restaurants or do cafe or do start catering um the cafe is great for we just did a medical office or this afternoon where we're sending out sandwiches cookies 'em all sorts of pastries and we can do that any day it's great cafe can do a lot of fresh baked goods that\nThat people seem to really enjoy 'em and it's really been picking up all the catering that we've been doing for that a lot of office parties left office lunches and stuff like\nThat that's where it was going to go because we're coming to the holiday time frame so would they can do is ... ... ... you can cater that parties and things like that yeah we ...\nWe can do off site um it's been growing ... really are rapidly we're doing a lot of offsite events but also in house as well a vintage here we do a lot of a lunchtime events and then at the cafe after it closes um we do a lot of cocktail parties as well I use that as a venue space as well\nSo he didn't know that you can really see you guys always\nSay to stores in the two spaces that a lot of flexibility in that we can you know all kinds of things might things in between things\nOkay so if you know is it not seeing the vintage cafe it is a ... said it was an absolutely great set up so I could see it for a contract party and then you have the tables outside type things that people can be said around outside I I didn't think about that is quite\nHere we are we just recently did a fundraiser up the country do the fundraiser their annual fundraiser over ... it was a beautiful set up with the high tops in the evening um and so we can really class it up in the cafe you know it's not just a coffee shop or you know the the building is ... really beautiful and it plays well into\nYeah ... yeah that is a great concept now how many people can you hold and in the cafe for say go to a party or for cocktail party we could probably do up to about Seventy five hundred low upstairs and downstairs and\nYes you need to take advantage of this and then you can go in and for nighttime events can you also do dinners and things like that\nUh we're we're a little a little bit limited because I'm a full kitchen but uh we uh do food from the Y. over at the cafe I'm so outside of a cocktail party we can do some buffets is well\nWhat are some things that we can be looking for during the holidays for\nFor ... vintage cafe\nUm as always we just put out some of our new fall menu items will be having some winter fall and winter more menu items coming out very soon

Willie ... and never seen that one before\nYes um we we do have a trailer and we we bring all of our equipment and has it's been great and worked out really well for us to have been joined in a lot of

two parties and things take area just talent and get it at your party I'm telling you he is absolutely incredible\nThink about it being brought to your office or your home that that just makes me

or go to James James with us today more showed me\nOh hey James\nHow're y'all were doing good how are you a bit bigger than they allow man God Bless America hey go what's on your mind too that I have to know 'course you yes oh how many people\nIn the tank and one of the Senate and the house vote for impeachment meaning Spanish or after\nAll six or seven oh you have to have a super ... yes I\nAnd then a third to override a veto I mean you have to I mean is that after the ... minute tone broad\nReach those I sixty seven\nOkay All right I'm all for the Democrats take control of all\nThey still have to be a super majority in the ... if they do do do you think\nYou know and and and it's kind of hard to be honest with James ... the way the Republicans are playing this they impeachment happens in the house and there's a majority vote they are they\nFinding them guilty not guilty happens in the Senate and the chief justice of the Supreme Court is the presiding judge and then the evidence is about to the uh the senators and they voted as a jury\n... and now\n... and correct me if I'm\nIn the odds of that happening are not very good\nUh well I Know that the ... you know and I wasn't there and I understand the reason that the Republicans did not vote in the uh\nClinton was I think they saw the it would have been a terrible thing to happen in the country and I you know I don't know what is there in the in anything that Trump is doing is ... and ... been found guilty of any you\nKnow hadn't been found guilty of anything and is that the threshold is how crimes\nAnd misdemeanors\nRight he has not been found guilty are in the ... been accused of being\nAlone and you know let let me kind of set the congressional the constitutional record strike the when when you look at it he cannot really be found guilty in Cornwall\nHe lives the way the constitution is set up is to is finding him guilty in charge of ... are charging him that is only can be done by the house of representatives finding him guilty can only be done by the Senate\n... um\nI think it'd be hard pressed to find a president guilty what he is president in Cornwall the separation of\nOkay um and and the reason I you know and I\nI just um you know the the listening to the nightly news\nThey don't want immigrants like control we're going to teach Trump and then my goal when I have a pen and then they're going to put a mostly in all of this just don't fall into point only got to do just get out\nIn the not the power succession doesn't quite work like that but\nAnd we elect a I I was sort of and I know I don't know if they you know if they if they think back over the house\nYou know any first time they regret to have to now so you know and I don't think the world come to I don't want it to happen but you know as long as there's still a ... and um I just don't believe that they would have to get\nThe um all the Democrats plus ... or so I'm Republicans would have to vote to a vote Trump guilty\nWell what what's your well Louis kind of go let's go a little further ahead what what they're talking about is it the Democrats win the house at all the Democrats would vote for\nImpeachment let's say hypothetically and so he would be he would be impeached by the house and then that would transfer over to the Senate and the Senate would have to find him innocent or guilty\nOkay so how the the houses the people who is trying to do is just one\nRight but it didn't take 'em out about it don't take 'em out of opposition to the Senate votes\nOkay and then I'm All right and I'm about one governor hunt they actually found governor about guilt\nYeah they found governor hunt went to trial\nRight he wants to trial and was found guilty found guilty I'm okay and I'm a ... I'm I'm just of course I kind of through a kind of thought I had all this in my head correctly but I don't care who do you think you are so I'm ...\n[laughter] or do more to the same day and they don't tell you one thing James that will happen if the Democrats do that they will pay a price in twenty twenty that will be unlivable they'll probably lose if the seats\nRight that that's a yeah I don't think a a you know I Believe if they do is they believe how I don't think it's going to be a two year term because they're going to do so much\nTo screw up that bothered by the end up there two years people are going to rise in rebellion and I believe you agree I think they would do to you know astronomical\nUh to um the Democratic party so I'm pretty sure that in our lives and but anyway I'm Glad you a question do do a good job and and I want to compliment yeah we oh he's not he's\nHuh so you generally very tiny little zoo appreciate a James really do\nAny I listen to the other night and he's very insightful and I'm a very um a ... he's a individual\nEverybody lives showing that probably what they see it now they a lot of people are individual but generally is definitely an individual and you know I'm Glad to listen to all and hope you continue owning you good luck American\nScience shows that I Wish I had known as we bought one demo show will be back after this [noise]\n\nYou're listening to the Dannemora show on the news ... three point\nMade grey [noise]\nWas a [noise]\nLot and na\nUh I had a ball and\n[noise] you\nKnow is that um [noise]\nYou know\nFigures advantages\nAnd all the ... hour we enjoy cars\nFreedom sitting on the river regions most trusted voice abused dog ... three boys wanna WABC the safety features designed\nSensibilities are overall greatness grew bigger and better the vehicles that stand out in each category this well get five thousand dollars off of twenty Eighteen ... it's a different way of living not just a different way of driving the twenty eight to ... to sixty group as a subtle but gorgeous ... top shelf interior and his quicken a straight line with five thousand dollars off it's a comfortable in all\nThe next in line is twenty two ... two hundred and sixty horse power turbo charged engine and well furnished the jury gets more than just a pretty face this crossover will fulfill your inherit potential not to mention your budget with five thousand dollars off and\nUm\n\n\nAnd\n[noise]\n\nMaster control so this is W.

will not be the last word on this matter from the United states\nI found like a very clear that this is not the end of the U.S response to this first of all what do you make of how the president has responded so far\nI think the president's comments about the cover up certainly reflect\nHas a very serious concern about the importance of collecting all the evidence about what transpired in Turkey and I think that's why he sent his director of CIA or Gina Haspel who has long experience in the region directly to turkey on the same day that President Amazon gave that speech yesterday a\nTo review the evidence with Turkish intelligence secretary palm pale announced what I think the beginning of steps reflecting what we know about so far but of course there may be other measures that we take down the road\nOkay so that is a former CIA tend to opening was up on the patio and then there's a pretty serious to statement that he uh he made and that that's you know these guys are going to be like woman around outside of Saudi Arabia is going to be too dangerous 'cause turkey could snatch him\nUs could snatch him now that the u._s. which gym but they could snatch him and um\nOh so junior high school and the others are going to be meeting with Trump and giving their opinion of what things are and I think that's one reason Trump is kind of his tone has changed here so it was sort of like they're more evidence and how 'bout MB yes ... is\nThe the comments to which you refer other president talking about this being a horrible cover up watch\nAnother thought about it should have never been done once they thought about it and [noise]\nEverything else was as who\nThe execution was are what they should have never been in this actually he should or a\nA physician and never happened\nSomewhat more needs to be done and what how should we further our response than\nYou know I think first of all the presidents right that is done bowl a Saudi conflict with no place to try to conduct a clandestine murder and really that's not consistent with Saudi history anyway there's still appears to me based on what we know to be a rent dish and having gone tragically wrong more than anything else\nBut I Do believe that there are significant more facts still to be collected\nWe don't know what the orders worried about Fifteen maintain we don't know who gave the orders we don't know if they were carried out is intended we don't know the extent to which ... might or might not be involved just today president aired on senior aides Charlotte's\nA said that Mohammed bin Salman had blood on his hands which is a very strong or allegation we should be aware and the administration is aware of the broader implications\nFor the Turkish Saudi relationship of this murder and of course our national security in the middle east Saudi and uh and turkey are rivals turkey supports the Muslim Brotherhood which gained a lot of traction a following the Arab Spring and I think the Saudis certainly consider the Muslim Brotherhood to be next essential threat\nAnd hence the I'm very serious issues uh\nAn animosity between here and\nThere was only three but one demo show will be back with more\nRight after the ...\nWas you\nKnow\nAnd third or I Would highlight Saudi Arabia is efforts to modernize you know yesterday was the beginning of the ah investors conference in Saudi Arabia the United states pulled out as soon as many other nations\nI certainly in our interest to ensure that that carries on a ... among signature program the twenty thirty vision is certainly um [noise]\nI think right now uh has to be great concern about the future of that uh because of investors concerns about enabling Saudi Arabia to diversify their economy build infrastructure but really it's in our interest to continue to to ensure that that does happen\n\nAt the the minutia in a photograph with the MPs who is a bad one that I don't think that one was a very smart a ploy just go to the phones here in a way we're going to name oh show\nI I realized that the Trump folic ... radio in the White House we're going to have a a\n[laughter] okay\nOh Canada for a minute or so I asked him what do you think we\nShould we let the people here are his first response before we get the Atlanta mayor great we've got burnt down by about ... oh I work I Try to your mind open on the front door because they're coming through your body\nAnd just push up in Canada where do you think\nI hear British Columbia is beautiful it's absolutely gorgeous this time of year hundred among the winners or candidate Canadian winners ... candidate say well you said open\nThe door so we're just through with the oldest here you go you have the tenth out and anybody else that comes up here\nThat yeah I mean to place them somewhere so we'll just say we're going to put a little bows on them and send them up to you\nAnd then we can happen to Germany [laughter] ... that you know it's just put them on a bus and those are home to Germany happened again and it's like they're we have now said it I think that could work or how do I like who are like he was thinking oh we all have a great day\nThose where when I get to the migrants subject let me finish one more piece of this and we'll get into the uh\nThe migrant care of him\nHere are just going to try that out of the idea of ending arms sales to Saudi Arabia and continues to oppose that idea than we were just hurting ourselves for his own words on that but he said he's going to defer to Congress or at least to an extent on the next steps going forward so we are left wondering where the solve other than that overall the administration is\nA response has the president making clear which has nothing from the thinking\nWell I think the president's messages from the beginning until now reflect\nWhat we didn't know at the beginning there was a lot of Saudi obfuscation you'll recall viewers will recall at the beginning the Saudis were saying that ... had walked out of the conflict which appears to be their effort to conceal what went on inside the conflict by having a body double a leap\nAnd seem to reflect what he knew at the time [noise] uh and currently has more I think harshest statements about Sally obfuscation lack of transparency and the need to gather evidence reflect what he now knows [noise] and so stay tuned for what we're going to see I think we have little hills\nAs soon as soon as the wintertime we're talking with them ...\n... who are you oh beautiful and that ... dot org and I was from really was beautiful golly mousers [noise] um I don't of course all the topics ... talk ... around with that one thing I heard it on our shocked to hear\nThis amendment on\nI'm to put a than commandment back in state building\nYou know what I'm Talking about I Do know what you don't\nHave them stupid can people be\nWell or was that stupid because [noise] didn't we just go through this like more and more um colored admit against the law to put Ten Commandments in government building no it's not\nNo matter of fact it to the landmark cases are way more case where you had the ten commandments in his a court room and they tried to get him to take it out and they lost every single case\nAlso roar and more actually want and I left than commandments in the courthouse\nIn his ... in his uh to court when\nOh\nI didn't know so those that tablet Ten Commandments still down there\nI don't know it was it was his courtroom he put them in maybe the next shows took them out you know I don't know if the huge monument is down there no no no no you know who it was it was a wooden legs you did was apply that you would curb you know yeah that would be all out but then they ...\nYou know I just don't think it's a good idea to colored or religion and government um\nUh you know it just opens up a thing for all other religions we're supposed to keep them separate and obviously it's it's kind of support it [noise] um you know there's a lot of things more important things corner on despite that having the ten commandments they've got ...

whole thing and peace right ever seen the whole thing straight out it's one of those movies that's been shown on TV ... catch up on a fast to cause some\nYou know this is a Christmas movie but I just want to bring this up I saw Christmas Vacation and a lot as a kid on TV so we're thinking this is great and then there's like a fifth grade sixth sixth grade and it's like hey teach can we watch a

it is in the ... of course\nLike watching a I don't know if you have a thing in life with Eddie Murphy a martyr and oh yeah I watch it on TV man is totally different watching the real way to live like they say that I\nThink I've only seen it on TV I oh I Want to see the real I bought the DVD yet I haven't see I see no TV so I had to go buy the DVD and its way finding your own DVD man okay\nJust things you can't say that I may write mad or enough Marta Eddie Murphy Bernie Mac turtle called ...\nAnd I'm Wondering because I think the shining his iconic like it creeps people out it as a lot of everybody knows about the other twin girls as veteran at Greg told me earlier today those twin girls are now fifty years old\n... old as you know what I'm going the Lakers game I don't know about a hundred now it'd be dead [laughter] and I'm thinking\nThe shining it's more like that movie he talk about you see a little bit of it on TV where's The Exorcist actually scares\nSome people I'm Talking a lot of let's open this up if you had to pick Seth The Exorcist or the shining which when you go with shining all day yeah why why because you've got to give him argue Paul well of course my hatred of ghost movies\nOkay yeah I mean a ... yes exercise was the first and it it it did open the door for a lot of things and I mean what is it like Seventy three Seventy four Seventy three able yet awesome man but the shining whole different level of light terror and art\nYou know and the stress it is like three hours long but they both are though I mean both long movie or are they ... ah well\nYeah ... and Phil [laughter] no because I mean they they it's snow when you've been locked in this hundred room hotel\nThat people only staying in the summer and you're there to like kind of take care of it and write your book and then he starts going crazy and people had gone crazy before you know\nAnd like at the end okay here's Johnny okay yeah you know down and you know [laughter] and then you think of him frozen in the maze and in the backyard there was a ... at the end he's chasing his wife and the kid through the maze with max and then one of the last scenes in it you see a picture of him\nHe's sitting there in the maze froze and he's got to look on his face and then you see that picture\nOf all the people that have ever worked there from back in the day and like the twenties and then he had little pictures at it and they're\nReally well and that's the thing that's actually a Roger you've heard opens up his review the shining he says the shining challenges us to decide who is a reliable observer whose idea of and can we trust which seems appropriate today when he talked about the news\nUm but it's that's always a cool movie where you're like okay what's going on\nLike things aren't actually as they seem and that's there's a lot of different levels to where it makes the things that happen in the movie plausible yeah because it could be somebody's mental breakdown makes you question at your question everything is it the house is it him in the old lady\nLike American Psycho yeah All right you know he's got a returns videotape [laughter] I Love that movie we should\nWell that's not really hallway movie that's not as as crazy as a ... what about you are what are you thinking shining or The Exorcist I'm going to do with The Exorcist and the\nThe position\nIs is a little scarier for me right and\nAnd you know it's like the whole kid thing for me with the to the twins in the hallway\nWhen little Danny round the corner on his will try civil that scares me but watching her walk down the stairs upside down like crab walk that that just gets me even worse and it's just it it plays more on my\nFears I guess well and it does especially if you remember the time and I think it's still plays today I give ethics sexually your dad commented on Facebook right that he is he left his comment reserve you're what you're somebody said if you truly believe ... yeah\nThen you've got to believe and they came and said yeah and that is so if especially I think most folks do still in this country truly believe\nI mean that's a whole er topic how much do you believe yeah but if you really do and it's a movie about it\nThat's not presenting it in an over the top way like it's not a fantasy but it is like there are actually Catholic priest who perform exercises in these things like stick bought and whatnot have been documented and what may someone shrew stores mhm and that's what a gift\nAnd like I told you but I'm not take another from it I I Would love to see the full thing and it just said the goat Steve yeah come on man but is this something about the existence by from start to finish its its started his own row movies like the the the the\nThe the people getting demonic bleep possessed all that like the ... you think about movies like that it all stems from The Exorcist and to access his route that like the country has one of those games move I ever see unrest ... up to date movie\nUm and it all came from the ...

would be but you know what I'm open to persuasion there's another democracy this is Joey the king of his show\nIs down through their wages is yeah it would only Hungary is not a democracy in it\nBut I personally if I had to watch a movie tonight between ... and evil dead to ongoing evil dead to all day every day it's cool man I'll help you sleep [laughter]\nI Know I think it's funny\nNot Roger David agrees with me he said some people level one viewers will go this is just distasteful\nLevel two years ago this movie is about bad taste in his movies about it's a kind of an homage to\nHorror and comedy it's funny and gory but to a point where he goes this is like a weird dream I'm having a yeah yeah like where do the fact that he cuts off his own hand his hand turns on him still kind of funny 'cause he's not mad at the hand\nLike it just it goes a well deserved that Iowa evil days were like that you know like ... and ... but but it was funny some of those kids cousin each other out what was the kind of hilarious\nAs true [laughter] that's got some humor in it but it's I Will give it is it is I think scarier ... some odd but I I my choices evil dead to fit I'm open to persuasion though what you're going to the next round it will be facing pet cemetery in the ... next week\nWhile I'm throwing my head in fate I ain't got saying that as I just like the class I like clowns and it was way better than the original so if it's better than ever isn't as you don't know I Do know because you only watch half of it\nNo no I'll I'll watch the originally no no I'm Talking about the new one olive oil they're gonna have a sequel ... but the first one part one was better already scary um I I don't know is it the more ... than they originally and I\nI wouldn't say there is no it is the reason I don't like clowns to this day you know but ... done on that OK they did it right\nWell and actually I'm I'm a read a little bit of Roger ... writing last year he said quote clones are creepy no matter what\nWe can all agree on that right but penny wise dancing clown tracks down and torments the children of small town main and it is deeply unsettling\nThe latest incarnation is battery ... infamously Tim curries take on the character was so over the topic was laughable but uh this new one who said it's a\nWho who's the act of ... a ... opposite end of the ... but if you ... when it comes on and you got this clown in the soil woman in the way he talks like to chew on some popcorn\nMan that was one of the best parts where I Am pop pop I said man I'm walk out this the [laughter]\nThe law is is this something so my vote is it OK okay so that's all right so\nIn the beginning the little boy is chasing the boat down because his brothers too sick to come down an old penny wise gets the boat I got you on the corner and the old lady is on her porch and she goes to see the little kid down there looking in the sewer in a storm and the lady goes back in ...\nWhich that was that that kind of got me okay above the best part of this you know as a child losing a limb should on subtle anybody well it's gotten worse than some and daddy now I put my kid and all these situations I'm like what you're saying that if\nSomebody doesn't have a child is not going to be as upset by a child losing their arm ... it took me to have wanted\nTo really for stuff like that to me 'cause I didn't read my kids with other people are being banned them or see a penny wise [laughter]\nSo are you going with as well okay so that was the good part of can out onto the bad part or All right so um [noise] yes it was it's based in eighty nine so that explains all the crappy closing the court horrible hair and\nUm [noise] she the girls in her bathroom and this is after she already chopped her hair off in her hair goes down the sink and then like she goes back in the bathroom and then her hair\nHer hair comes out of the faucet sink and start pulling on her and then explodes blood on the bathroom\nAnd you're supposed to [noise]\n... like it's not nothing is supposed to happen\nAre supposed to come over and they can see it but the grownups can't see it in that house for the new\nThis beautiful music comes on and they grab the sponges and the buckets and they started spreading the blood off\nYou know that's too much ... know\nThat got in like the ... to clean up though he didn't like the drugs position of like oh we're happy and work clean enough it's a movie and always will be clean but that\nThat adds to the previous no not for me that ruined it has some type of emotion in it you know it's the girl here like the guy was like and you are you scared the rest of the movie I guess the only reason for this movie but I'm over here and this point\nIs that he had always been a change that\nGuy okay and then and then\nThe the the the main rock and roll angry college kid or a high school kids are on one side of the the Cory ... and then the young little kids the rule freshmen during the other side of the Corey and then everybody started throwing rocks at each other and you have that we've talked about I Know or you don't like\nThe ... yeah because we got cut in early in the little guy\nIs worse than the rocks man it's just but that's what happened the kids now you know bully and it's got to run for early voting is real world\nLike huge hand size rocks at each other I mean one of them hit you and a half boom you're dead\nYeah ... it I just man so are you picking evil that too yes [laughter]\nMe on evil guy alright the the hand that gets cut off okay and the Han runs around like the hand that\nAdam Sandler right and it goes into the mouse hole in the wall here it it makes a noise to\n\nEvery day says broom stick with the Sean also shotgun any aides listening and cause you can hear the hand crawling through the wall\nAnd then the hand goes in his ear which is up and he bowed bones and then all of a sudden out of all these holes in the wall this Kool Aid blood just comes out and I mean just to\nCover them yeah oh I loved it and it was ridiculous just ridiculously great and when I was like Bob and I saw it kind of scared me\nThose little redneck Bobby Joel run into the world is Bobby jak oh and she's getting molested by vines\nI mean that we're going to move yeah it was crazy and then at the end you because all throughout the whole movie you get the point of view of the monster you know in Iraq and he's a camera and then like at that one point when he picks up Bruce Campbell and he's\nLift him up and the cameras following him and you see him that the ... the camera angles and stuff like that\n... and it's an awesome thing that nobody ever does right and um then at the end of the movie you get to see the big monster I mean he changed solve the big monster riding high\nAnd then that's when it kinda goes downhill and to get sucked back in time I don't have an ... to him and Bruce Campbell makes sense that saga good have you watched much as ... that I really some of it like I say some ... while I", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Coosada", "day": "24"}
