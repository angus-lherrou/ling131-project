crash site or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story the crushing Roswell were what can they do [noise]\n[noise] so they can go to the rival on international year for a museum and Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the clash\nI'm definitely would check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe in addition to that we have a UFO tours that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first for over Twenty years\nAnd he will take you to the exact location of the timing of the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival\nFor the first time last year the bulk or families where the crash occurred allegedly they will take you out to the crash site where a Mac Brazil's rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see\nWhere the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people checked out\nAnd um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay she'll continue to use the word allegedly which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are\nKind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves [noise]\nUh we you know there's a lot of research there's a lot of\nA local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the museum\nUh the locals know who the tourists are because at the sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into area fifty one which is a great story or bring your camera take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have few amazing aliens that we'd decorate a for each holiday especially now for Halloween\n[laughter] he puts on a big fall festival with our police officers and things like that for the community but um these they're about six foot aliens and uh people love to take\nYou know are implanted mine owner ... ... and I you know people really come here starting pray that career at work or we we don't want to say one way or the ... we want to hear it out for themselves and be very very\nWell that'd be great thank you I appreciate that let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Roswell for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nAnd there are ... are ... and five were wearing pound about forty thousand on ... on the ... anniversary of all\nI'm you know we hit close to ... our our eyes on average per year for Korean family here a little over two hundred and thirty out in ... at your own Vienna and Research Center [noise]\nPretty good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts or and so I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you honey to and if I'm if I'm driving through time I get a chance they'll say hello okay yeah cream hair and care\nHoney to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism a public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a Gemini let me just tell you who very funny book you resist great sense of humor I really enjoy all the sort of a comic asides on a serious subject because\n... and we'll get to this ... this is this is a very unusual\nPlace in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline of American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October is that about right\nAll right uh there are about forty thousand usually 'em and eat on Halloween just telling me that self it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course with him on it than a quarter million so the massive amount of people for the small city to have a within his orders [noise]\nWell I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but he picked Halloween and save the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened and and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just get a guest a couple of weeks ago\nAbout a and the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and it you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\n... ... ... ... there are other places around the world outside of Salem that had massive hangings and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\n[noise] yeah I always try to tell people that are more than the first ever which trial wasn't the wife of the ... and all the trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for the you know there are [noise] you know the first for trout America unit of it was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims of course injuries\nFor what he really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that keep that lives but still that's an extraordinary number of which has killed\nIt is and it's honestly it's really a problem today even and not and I'm also developed countries are still we're being being executed for being what to do\nYou don't want it that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's still a Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween\nAnd the way um I like the rub zombies story there\nIn the book to and then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer in American history and you've never heard of that either that's coming up next our coast to coast am this dizzy and\nHad worked beautifully owner\nRichard astro here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system which has hailed this gentleman's hot\nThe immune system can be called one of the bodies fears this powers to he'll visit C. A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com\nEight six six eight three six eight seven three five\nThat's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nSo er Jay W locker author of a season with the which I just had to look at some of those steps that we had mentioned\nMore vaguely two thousand eleven ... Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt lincolnshire England a long ago turned its tend to which is incident in which ten people were hanged and sixteen twelve into our tourist draw\nIn Sweden there's a witch memorial for more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nA hundred and fifty victims in late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and it's just some of them and not even old that happened in America but its Salem ...\nThat sticks out and so why why do do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery honestly even that's one of the big questions I had gone to the book and I think it's a combination of probably ... who doesn't different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing\n[laughter] oh yeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that monitor and kind of held on to it you know over the course of about two centuries\nBut it's kind of a you know it's a monitor group Shane ... right I mean it's not that's not usually what a town holds onto you know the ... and you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened\nThere but ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and\nFor whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home of that crazy serial killer famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\nRight through it I think to to fight for that one is that [noise]\nYou know the tragedy in Salem itself was basically just because the court happened in Salem right it was the civic part of the trial actual family members and the you know the people who really bear that shame over the course generation\nAround and say on the actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver's was at the time to film village so Sam itself doesn't really have a kind of a kind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim of a witch trials I mean the actual which is I live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... than it was kind of become Halloween town as well so it's a determined which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today in twenty eight team\nYeah against it and this is important in a ... this is this great distinction can't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims of murder [laughter] that they were executed and did they protested their innocence until the end\nAnd there's a whole industry kind of build up around them now\n[noise] yeah not a big ... dealing with that responsibility is something that feeling of kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath underneath there for board so to speak then part of it that's less connected to the tragedy with more just around\nYou know the identity and all these other kind of thing just become and and twenty team\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute and ammonium [laughter] we're going to see is so they they don't celebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they felt it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first [noise] um but really the blood over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September\nOr when you're just going to get pandemonium crowd there's a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of Salem itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically\nIt is it really is um they're talking again a hundred thousand people packed to the small downtime with the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes a freak each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all those kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras was a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans Mardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\n[noise] um but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same ... that you get an Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol that's consumed during this celebration\nHeld definitely actually right now we're in the middle of a nor'easter so that cuts down right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween [noise] right yeah the part of it but this is within the party ...\nOkay so you you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean the Salem known for being hunted either Salem witch Denver's former Salem Village or Salem ... are there are a lot of haunted houses or where there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trials [noise]\nOh yeah there's all kinds of mythology around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims\nYou have monsters because of the film was trials didn't just above which is in the story involves the humans and chimps and shape sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history or three hundred and Thirty years of history\nSo that is just you know a lot of dead people over the centuries [laughter] so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening in the ... um ghost tours there's spooky places there's the the ... the executions if everything you need to build the kind of spooky\nPathology around the city now you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there to oh yeah all the time all the time they're two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but is that my phone so I I don't the career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders things are all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest in that as more of the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest is more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me\nYeah let's let's the best what's the best spooky story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured while you've been there\n[noise] um well one of the uh one of the really creepy ones is one of the Boston trained a victim happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to the real you know real actual historical event that then I can reverberate and have come with all due around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape from the jail they're\nSo all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of events happened in Salem there's nothing to do with the witch trials it's all that kind of some kind of feeds into that kind of cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there some money to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm curious ... wizard attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was ...\nIm or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was real police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do and he was in town a performing who go to a local police station or somewhere\nAnd perform a quick active you know scape as a PR move for his next big event so he wasn't down there doing more of a say on boxing but who is doing is uh is escape escape routine\nLike ... ... ... you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this ... idea of the the the celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into all of this\nOh it's great for my favorite elements of the founders of the city and complete conflict at all times between you know tourists and historians and visitors and residents and dark museum and the which is which is that this really strange position where they call them which is a ... you know do a U.S in the religion around it but they have to deal with the baggage of\nFor a limited time get blown off season typing and rebate money\nYour money away on high utility belt and

I may revisited that because I've always been very interested in as well but the men's on the train is a story it just it speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said\nIs is there any story too old to be told\nOr when it comes to you know retailing his story about a murder and she said absolutely not she said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said which which best is it's actually\nNew is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that either been incorrectly adjudicated\nWhich we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it but also is true for all the time that there will be of the Wii somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed\nJust isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody has connecting them\nYet but in ... in one at least in one case a ... a a a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up\nBeing killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he can do even though we know now with these totally innocent\nOr they are right there are there to while they're there for people who are extra wrongly executed for crimes that\nI Would go so far as the saying I'm fairly certain of the crime was committed by the man from the train or the local person was executed nonetheless\nThe or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure the uh uh but there there were also nine people nine black people who were murdered by a Lynch mob who are when there was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by a man from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight last that we are pretty sure that with him was Nineteen crawl although there was a there was an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say that at ten\nSo I looked in the ... I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... when ... Illinois they saw the town where a home alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the whole Malone house [noise] um and\n... the mayor in around the turn of the century in ... one of the first mayors of the town I'm was murdered alone with his wife in their home\nIn a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah\nAnd it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into this sort of thing where I get it and uh and ... the the belief was always it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them\nUm but ... and when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of the men from the train\nThe it it is possible we have we assumed that we did not find [noise] every crime that he committed we just we found those\nUh which there were enough signature a sick signature ah characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're both with him but they they may well committed and probably did commit other crimes\nThat are we just did not have enough information about it but that's that's a new and actually I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear about Ken scratching 'cause I'm riding down\nWith an extra burden that I have a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually signed up this afternoon on it I couldn't\nUm and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody but it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a ... a poke anyway so how many people do we think\nWere murdered along Americans railroad tracks by single perpetrator\nDemand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason or ... you know during this period\n[laughter] well what Rachel I did was we ... put the murders and Buckeye right there's a hundred per cent boxer that his crimes were certain ... ah Seventy percent bucket or forty percent bucket and I've kind of ... percent bucket dry\nAnd then wait total up the numbers of murders and each pocket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a [noise] ... that ah [noise]\nIt was our our criminal and the murder of the tunnel came up with a hundred and one\nThat actually include the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state a lot for crimes they committed and the the or somewhere between four and nine people who were who were murdered by a Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or it may have\nIn his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions as murders because they were innocent um ... do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims for this guy okay All right so ... ... get gets through a a typical\n... ... as you as you see the pattern developing in the late ... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nOh well this is a long this could be a wrong answer I'm not a long winded person booth could be a long answer because there are a lot of things that ... them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight\nOr a family is murder most often a family including a young girl who is murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small town too small to have a waste of ...\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad track or the I'm a very often bodies are moved there we're going to act\nThe act is found in the ... and the yard of the victims or in the yard of a neighbor and they actually the ban then at the same as a crime or handle is washed her fingerprints\nThe house is locked up tied to all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with blankets or that you can't see it all the doors are locked the or or\nSomething is jammed in the door or a or the ... and offering move bodies post mortem so the police when they broke and what crime they are a huge blood stain in one room on them a bloody tray on the bodies in another room or the um [noise]\nThe ... really has graduated or up to me because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to\nFind that hard to touch Sanford is like an extended like a little bit but yeah there was more of them aren't they what's that like thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that the uh the uh the crime you normally occurred on Sunday nights they use the Kurt on the weekends\nUp until Nineteen pan the crimes almost all occurred in areas in which the primary industry was logging her one of the primary understood as those logging ... bay um your doors or doors and windows ... jam shot I think I mentioned that\nThe um [noise] ... there was all there are clear geographic patterns and the murders if one occurs is south of Portland the next occurs just north of Portland a there that that would be a link between them they ah [noise]\nAh one thing that is odd is that he would he would ... take a laugh\nFrom inside the house turn the way way down low so that you just gave up a little bit of light\nTake the chairman a offer lamp and set it on the floor usually under a table a and then carry the lamp around with him as he committed murders\nAnd the other thing is that he would a ... ... ... total blankets over the head of a sleeping person or a half a second before you went ahead with an axe that he did that a lot and they probably did that to keep the blood from ... flying back and hitting hitting him as he was\nOrdering someone there are quite a detailed pattern of behavior [noise]\nUh yeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and go into the early twentieth century following along\nLogging lines that actually would be consistent with we're this murder happened it's not that\nThe town that I grew up in his logging town but he was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started a new and that was plenty of logging was going on in in Wisconsin it was a it was insane for that matter Michigan just around the other side\nOf Chicago so very likely could have could have followed that ... another\nThing I forgot to mention our the all in warm weather\nWith one one possible exception there's one crime that he that he may have ... his first crime which was and just an outburst of anger and not and not a plan to vent probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\nUm we're talking about the Americans most elusive serial killer at Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that to be around\nIt hit a probably might be but I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I knew I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder in American history or the first or something murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... that in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is killing gone in secret there because it is done in in the critical facts about it our number ... holy known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed and\n[noise] um you get a lot of different people who claimed to be the worst serial murder\nTo that ... ... ... and the person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document\nAll the crimes to be attributed to really anybody\nYeah and then it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely\nNobody would ever know about it then they could they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without homes much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims Sprite or John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long\nBut the demand from the train is as ... as he's called ... and we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this in terms of solving the crime is a little bit later on almost don't want to 'cause I don't want to ruin and I'm so close to ... you know finishing I was reading all afternoon seriously but then there's a couple of good football games I got distracted at dinner\nSo they it but this guy he nobody it it it would be president isn't for us to just assume that there was some national awareness\nOf the killer who was lurking alone Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks because there is a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out\nAbout killers alone trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight and nine pain eleven nothing at all the ... and that this has to do with the organization of the a wire services at that time and Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nInnovation of this type had little ability the spread from town to town\nBy Nineteen twelve the national wire services were were organized and a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other a wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he'd been killing people for about twelve years [noise]\nAnd ah October of Nineteen eleven and all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when they went to his most famous crime ... in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is Pam and this is related crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on ... ... for the first\n... more than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all\nEven when logically they should have that even though you look at the crime than there was a case in Virginia West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart the uh uh and and pounds that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year\nSo you would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man our little who was later executed for it and the second crime was was investigated as a totally separate event\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to the lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire it doesn't it's not just that it's also\nIt speaks to the inefficiency of the jurisdiction of sharing a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was new national or investigative bodies of like the FBI yet so there was nobody that he would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of\nThat's exactly true and that introduces this also into one of the major themes of the book which is the\nAnd you know I've been writing about crime for a long time ... I'm I thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how backward and ineffective and judicial system was just a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how\nThe premise of the the investigative\nProcess war at the time of these crimes and what the man from the train did was to\nExploit the peculiar weaknesses of of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture the uh he knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered\nThere was no no way really to\nTo connect it to him and he knew that if he committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it but if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on [noise] but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him [noise]\n[noise] and and forensic medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean there's ... ... ... and ... this was a ... and then ... even through and another piece eaten in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn 'em ... is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science [noise]\nUm yeah and I I wrote about this a little bit in in the in a true crime book I had written about this murder that happened in my family in that the the ... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nBy telling them this is new do it's it's not science\nLook at all these crazy things they're talking about we know none of these things are true now of course we look at juries very differently right and they have a very ... they're now they have the CSI insect Minnick spending the forensics to be presented to them like it is on a TV show the back then it was exactly the opposite they ... they\nThey were resistant to it\nWell and there was this until because they didn't grow up with it\nBe a a ... when in Eighteen Ninety eight of the time in the bathroom transfer murder a fingerprint Toronto and from a forensic standpoint uh it had been known since the ancient world but that by it'd been known by some people that the rich patterns on your fingers were unique\nMortgage dot com that's a LA home mortgage dot com to see just how much money you could be fading with an Alabama home mortgage and in the last three Seventy three something for equal housing lender\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center says is W.

blend in really well with the Halloween festivities that are coming up we'll talk more about that coming up and just a second and we'll we'll go around the horn 'em to a couple of places that are celebrating\nHalloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with a K W Oscar who's the author of a season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago\nAbout uh the Salem witch trials and how historians had been changing their views and who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim in it so it was fascinating go back if you remember of\nCoast insider and listen for it but coming up next our\nThis is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this ... this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a a writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight\nIn Los Angeles we're not competing again he\nExtended the game that the Dodgers ended up playing last night uh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game uh but but tonight a little different uh Bo Sox lead the series now three to one the\nDodgers will get another shot at it coming up tomorrow night to send the sea respect to Boston three to two but\nBut let me just say if it hadn't been for that error I'm In the top of the thirteenth the bottom of the thirteenth yeah\nUh it it would all be over now the boss to be going home with the trophy\nUp at the games over and for those of you that missed the first two hours of last night's show because you were following the game or you should to also go back and listen to it through coast insider it was really interesting and I kind of a host he's afraid that the against Michael guild and the science writer former professor\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to a defense insider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada\nUm and what they had recently uncovered but but if they did well then you know they would it would become the new Roswell\nI'm kinda happy with the old Roswell and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nWill so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel and and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to rouse while all the time but this is the time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were\nFor Halloween what do you do it if it was kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of aliens and invading armies and all of that it's if it's\nIf it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] and people go out here ... ... am on a farm and ranch community about seven miles out of town where they are and and the corn me [noise] I agree ... a coordinated together\nThere's only on a UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven or they change it every single year and it's just a great opportunity for people to go out and really try to experience a you know about haunted feeling of getting lost in a field like\nYou're a crash in Nineteen forty seven other people go out to bottom like state park\nAh which again has a mystery at the bottom lists and um it is I'll ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place the RV camp and things like that\nBut again I'm more more of the stars and the telescopes and people get dressed up and\nThey feel that they become one or they may come down and uh you know it's just that that theory of there is something here that landed and they're trying to connect with them especially around Halloween and during the UFO festival in July\nSo I'll be traveling ... moving coming up to them in a couple of weeks and I'm driving up through Russia's role in my way to\nUh my new position will be teaching to Kansas State and my my ... my younger son and I was always wanted to coat did Roswell right so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to dip to launch the Roswell before we come back up again\nIt's in totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there anybody we're interested in in being able to go to the crash site um or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story the crushing Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international year from him and Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the crash\nI'm definitely would check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe in addition to that we have a UFO toward that is done by local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first for over Twenty years and he will take\nYou to the exact location of the timing of the incident\nAnd on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the book or families where the crash occurred allegedly they will take you out to the crash site where a Mac Brazil's rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see\nWhere the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of of things\nThat I Would definitely recommend that people check out and um you know search for the trees and so\nOkay she'll plenty to use the word allegedly which makes me suspect you're not a ... of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are\nKind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nUh we you know there's a lot of research there's a lot of\nA local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the museum\nUh the locals know who the tourists are because at the sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas fifty one which is a great story I bring your camera take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have two amazing aliens that we'd decorate for each holiday especially now for Halloween\nPuts on a big fall festival with\nOur police officers and things like that for the community but um these they're about six foot aliens and uh people love to take pictures\nAt the mine owner ... ... and I you know people really come here to play the career at work or we we don't want to say one way or the ... we want them to ignore it out for themselves and with every\nWell that'd be great thank you I appreciate that let me let me ask you how many people show up ... every year in Roswell for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nAnd there are ... ... five were wearing pound about forty thousand on actually on the ... anniversary of the act of all\nI'm you know we hit ... he got ... our our eyes on average per year for Korean family here a little over two hundred and thirty out in ... at your own VN and Research Center [noise]\nPretty good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts or and so I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you honey to and if I'm if I'm driving through time I get a chance they'll say hello okay yeah please bear and care\nHoney to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism a public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a Gemini let me just tell you who very funny book you resist a great sense of humor I really enjoy all the sort of a comic asides on a serious subject because\n... and we'll get to this ... this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline of American history but\nI thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October is it about right\n[noise] yeah 'cause I have I write a letter to the er about forty thousand usually 'em and eat on Halloween just telling me that so it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course of the month than a quarter million so the massive amount of people for the small city to have a within his orders [noise]\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drilled down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween and save the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications of the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just get a guest a couple of weeks ago\nAbout uh the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I it you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\n... that there are other places around the world outside of Salem that had massive hangings and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\n[noise] yeah I always try and tell people that say on wasn't the first ever which trial wasn't the wife of the ... and all the trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for the you know there are [noise] you know the first for trout America the victim was in Connecticut and Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims get injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which is killed\nIt in the honestly it's really a problem today even and not and I'm also developed countries are still we're being being executed for being what to do the strength\nI had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's still in Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to the season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem and Halloween\nAnd the way I like to rub zombies story there\nIn the book to and then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer in American history and you've never heard of that either that's coming up next our coast to coast am busy in\nOur health markets Medicare assistant says freight\nThanks Mike this is Michael med bed for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance coal eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two that's eight hundred six nine for forty five forty to eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nSo ah Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look up some of those steps that we had mentioned more vaguely two thousand eleven ... Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt liquor England\nFor a long ago turned its ... which is incident in which ten people were hanged and sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden there's a witch memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn ... in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and it's just some of them and not even all that happened in America but its Salem\nThat sticks out and so why why do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery honestly even that's one of the big questions I had gone to the book and I think it's a combination of probably a dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing\n[laughter] oh yeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but it was about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that monitor and kind of held on to it you know over the course of about two centuries\nBut it's kind of like you know it's I'm On a cruise Shane ... right I mean it's not that's not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened\nThere but ... and they they take advantage of it for you\nKnow tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home of that crazy serial killer famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs and go it happen here folks\nRight through and I think to to fight for that one is that\nYou know the tragedy in Salem itself was basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was a civic part of the trials actual family members and the you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generation\nAround and say on the actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver's was at the time to film village so Sam itself doesn't really have a kind of a kind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victims but was trials I mean the actual which is I Lived there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since house and Senate was kind of become Halloween town as well so it's a determined which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today in twenty eight team\nYet ... against it and this is important in a ... this is a great distinction can't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is\nAbout innocent victims of murder [laughter] that they were executed and did they protested their innocence until the end\nAnd there's a whole industry kind of build up around them now\n[noise] yeah not a big ... dealing with that responsibility is something that feeling of kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath underneath there for ... so to speak then part of it that's left connected to the tragedy it's more just around\nYou know the identity and all these other kind of thing just become and and twenty a team\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute and ammonium [laughter] we're going to see is so they they don't celebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they felt it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first in October thirty first [noise] um but really the blood over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early on\nWe just going to get pandemonium crowd there's a lot of fun but it's a definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically\nIt is it really is um you're talking again a hundred thousand people packed the small downtime with the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes a freak each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras is a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans Mardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\n[noise] um but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in and they're so you're probably not going to get the same ... that you get an Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol that's consumed during this celebration\nHeld definitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that cuts down right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween ... part of it but this is within the party\nOkay so you mentioned haunted happenings but\nI mean the Salem known for being hunted either Salem witch Denver's former Salem Village who are seen them or are there are a lot of haunted houses or were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial [noise]\nOh yeah there's all kinds of mythology around that is it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims\nYou have monsters because of the film was trial didn't just involved which is in the story involves demons and m's than shaped sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass see all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history or three hundred and Thirty years of history\nSo that is just you know a lot of dead people over the centuries [laughter] so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening in the ... um ghost tours there's spooky places there's the the ... the executions if everything you need to build the kind of spooky pathology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there to oh yeah all the time I was there two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seem to be still situated didn't and and some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but is that my phone so I I don't that career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders and all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest in that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest is more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me\nYeah let's let's the best what's the best spooky story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured while you've been there\n[noise] um well one of the uh one of the really creepy ones is one of the Boston trained a victim happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual historical event but then I can reverberate and have come with all due around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape prone to jail they're\nSo all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of events happened in Salem does nothing to do with the witch trials for all that kind of some kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was or somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm here to do was there an attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was there\nIt's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was real police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do and he was in town a performing who go to a local police station or somewhere\nAnd perform a quick active you know a scape as a PR move for his next big event so he wasn't down there doing more of a say on boxing but who is doing is uh is escape escape routine\nLike ... ... ... you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into all of this\nTrade one of my favorite elements of the founders of the city and complete conflict at all times between you know tourists and historians and visitors and residents and dark museum and the witches and the winters have this really strange position where they call themselves which is a ... you know do a U.S in the religion around it but they have to deal with the baggage of\nHow that a three time unit for only four thousand nine hundred Ninety six dollars cat they see direct will say you money he'd called to explore sixty four sixty four and like

else\nBut then I decided that the book is too good and the story isn't really ...\nDay [noise] um and I just decided instead to ah up to give you a thought that I wanted to pass along with all sincerity I I I just want to make it clear that real life murder is not a parlor game\nOr a whenever we speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost whether it's one desk whether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler\nThe wages of Salem or the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking to night the lives lost represent children who will never see adulthood adults that will never see their children grow young men and women who had their human potential to offer the world taken away\nTruly innocent people who died at the hands of evil\nAnd the words of Clint Eastwood in one of my favorite movies are unforgiving it's a hell of a thing kill the demand take away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have [noise]\nSo even as the author of a true crime book myself and a book about how true crime stories are cold and why\nI treat the subject of murder personally the woman that was at the center of my true crime book a black night for the bluegrass bell was the first cousin of my grandmother and a beloved character in my mother's southern family history I wrote that book to set the story straight and defend her on her\nI had read about the first three chapters and then when I heard the Bo Sox made it into the series\nAnd my boxes that are heading to Kansas 'cause I'm moving to K state understand you live in Lawrence, Kansas a lot of\nThe ... on so I'm moving to Manhattan meant so be it will be like almost neighbors and ... yeah my wife up in Manhattan I Know very well and they were gonna do you\nOh totally cool so so I packed\nThe book and then I got the call like ... four days later on always good to go like uh the book isn't show the head of bad overnight me a book so that I had it in my hand but unfortunate awesome and I lost a few days reading time so I haven't finished yet and I love\nNothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading especially because I can tell already you're building up to a climax that I Do not want to miss\nWith this true story of the the the America's most elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your ear coauthor is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nMy coauthor my daughter ... daughter my daughter she uh she worked with me on a book [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that so I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a figure that out I didn't really say that and I worked\nOut well I'd probably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say I'm a great book obviously desserts all the accolades that you are getting for it and the fact that you very likely cracked this case is very much to your credit\nSo I I Want to start if I can with the uh by the way to congratulations on the ... of the red Sox win tonight and and\nWhat a game last night good things weren't book for last night huh\n[laughter] [noise] yeah I Would add to cancel out a\nLittle bit of torture [laughter] to keep all the way I have to be going well over here [laughter] [noise] but you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last the last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\n[laughter] [noise] oh I wouldn't say so I wrote about the bark Straggler along with hundreds of ... in a book I wrote maybe six or seven years ago called popular crime or a word I did um [noise]\n[noise] uh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took him and boxer stronger case and publish some theories about it with a baby right or wrong or no [laughter]\nWell I Love that I may I may revisited that because I've always been very interested in as well but the men's on the train is a story it just it speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing wants to and ruled the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said\nIs is there any story too old to be told or when it comes to you know retailing a story about a murder and she said absolutely not [noise]\nShe said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said which which best is it's actually\nNew is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that either been incorrectly adjudicated\nWhich we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it but also is true for all the time that that there'll be there'll be somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed\nJust isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody has connecting them yet but in ... in one at least in one case a ... a a a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up\nBeing killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now with these totally innocent\nThey are right there\nAwfully executed for crimes that may have been committed by the man from the train to them I Would go so far as the saying I'm fairly certain of the crime was committed by the man from the train but a local person was executed nonetheless\nThe or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure the uh uh uh but there there were also nine people nine black people who were murdered by Lynch mob ... who are when there was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by men from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight alas that we are pretty sure that was him was Nineteen quote all although there was a a a there was an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say that at ten\nSo I looked in the ... I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... or ... Illinois they saw the town where I'm home alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the whole Malone house [noise] um and\n... the mayor in around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town\nI'm was murdered alone with his wife in their home\nIn a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah\nAnd it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because she was kind of been to this sort of thing to where I get it and and ... the the belief was always that it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them [noise]\nUm but ... and when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the train\nThe it it is possible we haven't we assumed that we did not find\nEvery crime that he committed we just we found those [noise]\nUh which there were enough signature or a sick signature ah characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're both with him but they they may well have committed and probably did commit other crimes\nThat are we just did not have enough information about it but that's that's a new and actually I I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear about Penn scratching because I'm writing down\nWhen a murder that about a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't\nUm and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but I think it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody but it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong or you know forgive me but it's worth a ... a poke anyway so how many people do we think\nWere murdered along America's railroad tracks by a single perpetrator\nDemand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason or ... it you know during this period\n[laughter] well what Rachel I did was we ... put the murders and buckets are there's a hundred percent ... that is crimes were ... ... uh Seventy percent bucket of forty percent bucket and a ten percent bucket right\nAnd then wait total up the numbers of murders and each pocket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... [noise] that ah [noise]\nIt was a a criminal and the murder of the time I came up with as a hundred and one that actually include the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state\nA lot for crimes they committed and the the uh somewhere between four and nine people who [noise]\nDid commit or may have committed\nSome germs are the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions\nAs murders because they were innocent um do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims in this guy okay All right so ... ... ... a typical\nAs you as you see the pattern developing in the late\n... ... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nWell this is a long this could be a long answer I'm not a long winded person booth could be a long answer because there are a lot of things that ... them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight\nOr a family is murdered most often a family including a young girl who is murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small town in a town too small to have a waste of ...\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad tracks the I'm\nA very often bodies are moved there killing looking back\nThey actually is found in the in the yard of the victims are on the art of a neighbor and they actually the ban then at the scene of the crime or handle is washed her fingerprints\nThe house is locked up tied to all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with blankets for that you can't see it all the doors are locked the or or\nSomething is jammed in the door or a or the head off any move bodies post mortem so the police when they broke and what crime they are a huge blood stain in one room on them a bloody tray on the bodies in another room or the um [noise]\nReally it was going to do it or up to that because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to find\nThat hard to touch Sanford is like an extended like a little bit but yeah there was more of them or anything\nLike that actually like thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that the um the uh the crime you normally occurred on Sunday night so you heard on the weekends up until Nineteen pan the crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was logging her one of the primary understood as was logging\nThey I'm here nor as a doors and windows ... jam shot I think I mentioned that\nThe um [noise] there's all their clarity a graphic patterns and the murders if one occurs is south of Portland then ... just north of Portland a there that that would be a link between them they ah [noise]\nAh one thing that is odd is that he would he would you take a lap from inside the house turn the way way down low so that you just gave out a little bit of light take the chairman they offer lamp and set it on the floor usually under a table\nA and then carry the lamp around with him as he committed the murders and the other thing is that he would put pull the blankets over the head of a sleeping person or a half a second before you went ahead with an axe or are you there are a lot and they probably did that to\nKeep the blood from flying back and hitting hitting him as he was\nMurdering someone there\nAre quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nYeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along logging lines that actually would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that\nThe tone that I grew up in his logging town but he was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA new and that was plenty of logging was going on in in Wisconsin it was a it was insane for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed the ball and another\nThing I forgot to mention our all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he that he may have ... as far as crime which was and just an outburst of anger and not and not a planned event probably that occurred in cold weather\nBut he had to flee through cold weather and after that he'd never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\n[noise] um we're talking about the Americans most elusive serial killer at Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that to be around it\nHit a probably might be but I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I knew I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder in American history or the first or something murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... that in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing gone in secret fear because it is done in in the critical facts about it are never fully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed and ...\nClaimed to be the worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim that disgusting titled but I'm the person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document\nAll the crimes to be attributed to really anybody [noise]\nYeah I mean it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely\nNobody would ever know about it then they ... they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without hope much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims or John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long\nBut the demand from the train is as ... as he's called\n... and we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this at in terms of solving the crime is a little bit later on almost don't want to 'cause I don't want to ruin I'm so close to ... you know finishing I was reading all afternoon\nFuriously but then there's a couple of good football games I got distracted at dinner so the ... but this guy he nobody in the president has them for us to just assume that there was some national awareness\nOf the killer who was lurking alone Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks because there is a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out about killers alone trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight nine ten eleven nothing at all the ... and that this has to do with the organization of the a wire services at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nInnovation of this type have little ability the spread from town to town\nBy Nineteen twelve and a national wire services were were organized and a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other a wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years [noise]\nAnd ah October of Nineteen eleven and all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when he went to his most famous crime ... in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is Pam and this is the way this crime and the\nTerrible series that's been going on ... for the first\n... more than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all\nEven when logically they should have that even though you you look at the crime than there was a case in Virginia in West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart the er and and towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year\nSo you would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't the first crime was ... was hung on the shoulders of a man our little who was later executed for it and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate event\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to the lack of say the development and the Associated Press wire it doesn't it's not just that it's also it speaks to the inefficiency of the jurisdiction all sharing of a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was new national\nUh investigative bodies of like the FBI\nThese two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time [noise]\n[noise] that's exactly true and that introduces it's also into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time ... I'm\nI thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to [noise] to realize how backward and ineffective and judicial system was just a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how [noise]\nPremise the the investigative\nProcess war at the time of these crimes and what the man from the train did was to\nExploit the peculiar weaknesses of of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture\nThe or a new that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered\nThere was no no way really to\nTo connect it to him and he knew that if he committed a crime and the big city police were going to be all over it but if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on [noise] but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him [noise]\n[noise] and in forensic medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean the the ... and ... this was a ... and then ... even through and another ... piece in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn um is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science [noise]\nUm yeah and I ... I wrote about this a little bit in in the in a true crime book I had written about this murder that happened in my family in that they the ... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nBy telling them this is who do it's it's nuts science\nLook at all these crazy things they're talking about we know none of these things are true now of course we look at juries very differently right and they have a very there now they have this CSI insect Minnick spending the forensics to be presented to them like it is on a TV show the back then it was exactly the opposite they ... they\nThey were resistant to it\nWell and there was this because they didn't grow up with it\nThe uh uh ... when in Eighteen Ninety eight of the time in the bathroom transfer murder a fingerprint or I Know him from a forensic standpoint\nWe've got those it took pecan company don't forget about the ... the the tell them where you're located we're located at three fifty north McDonald street in downtown Montgomery you can check on the Web at talk of a gun dot com or cause it to six to ... on Facebook from\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control centers this is W.

are busy with you probably created a another billion dollars of value somewhere didn't ya\nWell has been a great area of growth forests them focused in on um India where we think will become one of the three largest economies in the world over the next Thirty years though on several new publications there on this trip and expanded our research and set up a hundred and fifty million dollar venture capital fund\nBush to an Indian born but when people move to the Silicon Valley became very successful entrepreneur is now they're going back to India uh how we want to give them some financial support and ideas and advice hell helped him build great companies over there as well\nI think it's great he's always on the leading edge he was on the leading edge back in the sixties when he goes into the world of computers are so far ahead of the ... and pat I'm sure many many people know the name international data group but for our first time listeners are those who are not quite familiar with everything you do\nUm give us a snapshot again of of ID gee\nI'm as it exists today and and then we'll go back and check it out\nYeah well we're company whose mission has been focused on providing people the most time will youthful and and or actionable information about computers communications and chronic\nOn and we do that for about three hundred or newspapers and magazines around the world with titles like computer world peace in the world ... are we have about forty fifty Web sites that are made in support those magazine brands and about twelve hundred different expeditions and conferences\nAround the world and then we've also build a family of venture capital companies to\nHelp a young entrepreneur is get started in the developing countries to be able to bring a lot of new products and services and about their choices to their local market\nAnd and the number of employees you have is in the thousands\nOr we had Thirteen thousand a current and poise John\nHere probably on the right trail to success because no one's done enough I write that\nFirst you were told you couldn't go to MIT you you you want a full scholarship there while you were there a ... became the editor of computers and all of the nation magazine correct\nThat's correct yes and and that really gave me a chance to get around during the summers and meet the heads of the computer companies and meet their top engineers and their product planner so\nI learned a tremendous amount about the companies and then when I came to start my own business um you know that was a big help or because they knew my name and and the in my writings and analysis and therefore they were willing to pay attention to\nA proposal that I made up um to set up a census of where the computers were and what the customers\nWho are using them wanted for future products and services\nAbsolutely yeah and that was a job you got while you're at MIT but you said which when you graduated correct\nA try the when as an editor I was out now talking to\nThe heads of the computer companies and helping them out you know told me that they had a need for this or um and when I had to propose the price he said that was too low I should charge more thought that'd be taken seriously so I Love that business idea and uh so I put put out the proposal and\nWound up having a nine companies and be checked for twenty five thousand dollars each perhaps payment so that was actually all the capital that used to get started so to\nA anyone asked me about how to start a business I'd say just talk to people who can be customers find out through unfulfilled needs and proposed to fill those needs and in many cases they'll they'll sponsor you they'll buy a subscription to your proposed service and otherwise advance money to help him get it going so you don't need to raise a lot of money\nIf you are in close touch with their customers they'll they'll be happy to support you\nWell absolutely and you know there's there's a real important antidote lesson here while you're working for that magazine and folks again it was it was called computers none of the nation back you know many years number of years ago or sixties\nOr was there and is about\nA six three stories sixty three ... and ... was his job is to go all over the country as you said and gather information a world of computers were Nell number this was back in the sixties he'd build up a tremendous knowledge\nAnd a resource civil wars that we're all located now don't listen I wanted to go back to that that they would love to hear from you ... you brought this idea back for a brand new publication and you brought it back to the publisher what did they tell you\nWell they said oh that's a market research project that's not something we're interested in and you you know you can do it on your own\nUh so I said fine I'll Try it and then that was what started the business and\nNow that we've had a number of cases like that um after doing the talking to 'em a lot of the managers of computer centers they said they needed um a weekly newspaper to help them get real information about what other people like them were experiencing with computers what with their problems and difficulties and we launched the weekly newspaper and everyone\nTold us it couldn't be done we are only putting fifty thousand dollars into the project all the money we had available and they told us how it's going to cost you a million dollars to a friend a weekly newspaper and you'll be out of business in two months and you know we'll\nEither you did well will pick up the pieces and carried on ourselves or if you win slowly will know it was a bad market where you'll save some money by showing us that you had a dead end project\nAnd fortunately we got very little advertising because we were new but we've got about Seventy thousand people who gave us a check for twelve dollars to subscribe to our publication so that was in fact a million dollars came out of the subscription advances we're getting from readers enthusiastic about our content\nThat's that's pretty amazing in ... when you go back to the original original um when when that publisher told you originally pat\nYou've got to do that we're not interested or telescopes hum how much money was raised in how you raise a toast\nEventually well uh I'm I've I've I couldn't I sold my car and put it in the five thousand dollars that was a little my proceeds available and then I went to my sister and I went to the first person I didn't point to go to buy or their general manager and\nSaid would you be willing to invest in support me in this project and they said well you know we know you and like you and everything but um we know these things risky they don't always succeed so each going to get your ten dollars while ... till you're okay you're very good adventure your capital availability\nSo so your seed capital was five thousand and twenty dollars by selling your car and getting a ten dollar bill from your wife and I and a manager you my sister and a manager\nSo I'm Sorry your yeah your sister made us human rights so so that was in Nineteen sixty three basic sixty four okay and and those to investors I got to recapture says to investors gave me the ten dollars what what's the ten dollars worth today\nAbout three and a half million dollars or see today [laughter]\nAbsolutely unbelievable absolutely amazed and they told you couldn't be done\nA ride which always encouraged me because uh\nUh you know if it was easily able to be done a lot of people would have already done it so when they say can be done and that means I'm going to have very much reduced competition and to this by energetically keeping in touch with um the customers and prospects you often find ways\nThat they would like to see the service provided that no one else has suggested and then you can charge in and [noise] you know put but but give them something that really wanting their own cars ethically support it\nIs that is ... I was going to ask is eager to success but when ... when you were growing business no matter what stage it as pets isn't that one of the uh the one of the critical elements that you use and success is always staying customer focused and listening to jam and listening to what they need sounds simple but so many people don't do it\nYou're right and when people ask me you know what does it take to be an entrepreneur I say when you have to find\nSomething you want to do you're passionate about do you have to give a lab at physical energy cuts that you have to put Seventeen Eighteen hour days and then the early days you know you have to keep your optimism high so you feel you're good positive spirit\nBut don't spend too much time sitting now making a paper plans because uh [noise] uh but you said that there was work your plan which has to do is work in the market going out and finding out what people want their changing needs and keeping you know right up to date with their changing needs and you'll be winning all the time if you try to\nGo ahead and roll out a plan that you made up some time you're almost sure to be way off the market within a year or two\nThat that's incredible I'm Glad you said then is very very intriguing because I find that a lot of the greatest entrepreneur in America the wealthiest most successful never really had a formal written business plan and if they did they usually throw it out\nI found that to be very helpful because you listen better if you don't have a lot of preconceived ideas in your mind\n... I Love it I Love it now now when you're blowing from a from a regional business you know start up you mentioned some of the critical element and what about growing from regional to national what are those next critical steps to grow a business even further\nOf course you had to make sure that your communication network has spread throughout the country to people in all parts of the country are aware of your projects and then of course the next step is to begin to move into other countries and are there the the key step is to go over and you know and punished we make discussions with the proposed\nCustomers to make sure they see the same needs and then go out and find someone in that country who uh shares your passion for the moment of those needs\nAnd you know has the enthusiasm that charisma to be able to hire and motivate good people and then you know give them the resources they want or give them an ... an encouragement and support get out of the way let them know\nIt will be no help and assistance but don't try to tell them how to do it because you're never going to fully understand a foreign market where the local person who lives in the culture every day is going to be much more able to move quickly adjusted changes within that bark at\nAnother point you came up with an you shared with me in the past is that on the decentralization was important to you and and you you you'd um honed in on the numbers are around a hundred and fifty is very key to the close to your business on your business units can you share with the number one safety is so important okay\nYeah that's our average business eyes you know I ... I found early on that uh was I was like a typical entrepreneur he wanders control everything make sure everything was happening anyway I expected and um then I realized that my attempt to control was actually slowing the growth of the business and that's why I really had the epiphany to say\nYou know I'm a what is really necessary is not my control but finding fertile markets and good at getting an enthusiastic leader\nAnd then I found that morale is I visited uh companies and even observing our own companies that are the morale was ... about a hundred and fifty people the people at that stage they knew each other they knew each other families they had a clear vision of why they're rule was so important in the company and they were all you know\nWork together as unified team a ... and it's interesting because that's sort of a you know we have people grow up in the uh families and usually like twelve family has made a tribe who migrated from place to place\nA so typically like twelve people in the family and tell you a hundred and forty four hundred and fifty people in this group of a human beings who would move around\nA and conduct all their activities and I think the mind is where they set up to deal with groups the bad side very comfortably and organizations get larger than that then you know people feel alienated its its them over there rather than us if you want everyone to say\nWho are winning uh we're doing things the other\n... that's why I have a hundred businesses I Know each one ended up by its own team and the average size is about a hundred and fifty people each\nA accelerated development that often you know has a quantitative of actual types of skills but um diminishes the social sensitivity and social interaction capability so\nThat you wind up having you know people who can be um [noise] a brilliant mathematician and you know it can multiply to ... ... digit numbers together or can hear a piano concerto ones can repeat it exactly and do amazing things in the specialized part of the brain that are related to math and music\nYet um you know they have very little sensitivity to other people they can't read another person's mood or file and you know they they walk away from people there really isolated that socially\nSo uh what we know hope our research will do is to identify what the biochemical\nOr other action in the developing brain and often this is a much more frequent and and males than females that causes the development of this autistic situation so it can be prevented or hopefully even reversed in cases where the child is now five or six to seven years old\n[laughter] it's amazing and I understand it the the ... statistics these days are one in one hundred and sixty six children's one out of one sixty six has autism\nAh that that's really tragic could make it says a hardship for the parents involved and and also requires a lifetime often very lifetime special attention so many other people need to get involved to help your child is not a good life\nWell I commend you and your wife are doing a a a tremendous job understand there's five hundred researchers at that location I Wish you the best of success with that and we get back ... break all you're quite welcome and we get back from this next break we're going to find out I'm going to ask you a pet what are some of the unexpected challenges entrepreneur as a business owners\nAll don't know there are obviously they don't expect they don't know what I was the unexpected challenges they run into maybe can help 'em out without a little okay ladies gentleman ... founder chairman of international data group will be back right after this legends of success [noise]\nIf you're a baby boomer with one hundred thousand or more of an vegetable assets this may be the most important in sixty seconds for your retirement we're sound income strategies and we transform typical portfolios that depend on speculative gross into portfolios that generates sustained retirement income for life and right now\nWe're offering the latest book from our founder David ...

A. C. the ... he was talking about a three point one riverside shoveled\nWelcome to viewpoint Montgomery longest running local talk show\nFocusing on community events and public service [noise]\nYour host Joey Clark\nMorning and welcome to viewpoints high and your host Julie course and it's going to be a wonderful show this\nMorning because I'm working welcoming back somebody has become a recurring guess\nGreat acquaintance good friend here\nIn the river region that's Leslie marker on it with the hands on river region how are you this morning Leslie I'm doing great jelly how are you I'm fantastic other than my you know my furs everybody that yeah there's all sorts of stories that we don't have time for folks because we have much more important things in my physical ailments or we have well\nFirst off it's a little early this year the Christmas clearinghouse it's really not cuter ... planning ahead it's good to get planning because it's already the month of October I've already got on my Christmas shopping says well I haven't but that's very wise ... to head\nThe November will be gone before you know it and Christmas will be here the end of December before you know and it's already the holiday season\nIt's ramping up so it's good to start planning ahead\nAnd so for folks out there who don't know what the Christmas clearing house is done through hands on river region as a sort of a one stop shop that you're making sure that you're not duplicating efforts too much that were sort of realizing oh everybody's coming together\nAnd we're finding particular families in need and we're making sure that it you know there is no belly who here that these families actually are definitely in ...\nWe do we do clear all the names of people that are applying for assistance through various organizations in the river region clear of those names to make sure there's no duplication of effort\nAwesome so what are some of the organizations that sort of team together they come to give up one they need probably notice twice pretot oh yeah the Marines and and Salvation Army numerous churches other nonprofit organizations\nThat the shelters in Montgomery\nAnyone who has clients who are in need that will be I'm requesting assistance during the holidays and other times throughout the year\nAnd so the general idea of the Christmas clearing houses you can do general donations correct absolutely will wait wait ideally we like to have families or groups that were going to adopt a fan of ... ... ... ... ...\nChild a special needs child or a single father or whatever you know whatever circumstances that might be near and dear to their heart that uh you can actually donate funds toys or adopted family\nWonderful okay well I mean it doesn't have to be Christmas Time bands will river regions always looking for this this will go to the Christmas clerk house though because it usually or pacify that right okay and you can general toys out there and then\nOne thing that we have done the last several years is the care of the care baskets because we found that families a lotta times can't purchase items that they need just for general household use with food stamps I mean you'd be shots at what brings his desk without by they can't buy so they can't buy the charge it can't buy diapers\nUm paper towels sell a lot of times when people adopt families they will actually donate a big laundry basket filled with household items and personal hygiene items\nSo when you adopt a family and see the you know tons of hands on river region in good hands on her origin dot org and ... all the information's there I adopted him when I say I I Want to adopt a family do you get to know kind of what the family's needs or are these sort\nOf yes when they apply for assistance there's actually a description of the family the family members their ages there genders and their wish lists ... so you could actually be more specific say out always adopt a child who loves a Spider Man\nFor the last four years I've dropped to adopt a than a single father with a young boy you won't Spiderman items so you you do get to know a little bit about them you can choose either delivered items to us\nAnd we will actually get the items to the family or he can deliver directly to the family\nThat's the choice of the the adopter so this is almost like a supplemental to Santa getting the than help out the the big guy with the beer exactly\nIn the ... or ... and this is amazing I really do encourage folks I Know it's early in the year but with the reason we're talking this early this year because\nI Want people to take up that calling to adopt a family going to get to know that family kind of what their needs are\nAnd that allows you to do it on a really personal basis I mean some people like you know right in the ... nothing wrong with that ... also they were not insects away absolutely though I Will not turn them away but\nWhen you can realize exactly where the money is going or exactly were your gifts are going to uh it really personalize it and makes you realize here's who I Am actually\nHelp right we've even had families adopt a famous Christmas and actually do it so early they can plan for Thanksgiving feast a wild delivered the family as well OK kind of taking in everything to do with the holiday is it all strings together ... says it all in all of a blur one\nBig holiday season and and again you are you finding these families through it can sort of toys for Todd's but\nYou mentioned different churches in the area they are essentially families that are in their congregation or families they meet during their outrage\nRight the families that they assess throughout the year that they know they're in need we provide the applications we collect all the applications clear it through our database\nAnd make sure that they're not applying more than one place for it so that the most people are adopted and there's a duplication that some if one family tries to go here there and everywhere\nThen they're they're not allowed into the program\nI understand I understand well and we don't want people to slip through the cracks too so people aiming up together again because you can go to hands on river region doubt or\nAll the information there you can look up the Christmas clearing house there's also all sorts of other things going on with hand on average Dutch or all the time\nFor maybe for folks who are in a church right now maybe they are ...\nYou're way that a hands on river region is really a one stop shop it's all nonprofits nonprofit fights of folks out there like that they're kind of getting into the nonprofit sector and they haven't heard of hands on river region I mean they can get in contact with you all to lately you know be part of your your team\nWere called the agency agency now we do is we help them to fill their mission we help them to collect the recruit volunteers to promote their activities and that sort of thing through our website through our um connection with our over four thousand five thousand volunteers are registered our side\nWhen let's go from that aspect people if you are interested in not necessarily and you have one thing in mind like maybe you want to do the Christmas clearing house and you want to adopt a family but maybe you're more like well I generally want to volunteer just don't know what yet you can register ride with hands on every lately\nIt's as easy as registering through your Facebook account okay uh a few details your name your email that's about all we need and

but what does the village made up of you know kind of right\nThat's why we were established United Way did a study and recognize that that community with a lot of volunteers in it are going to it's going to be healthier community\nOf of villages middle to upper those intrepid you know kind of entrepreneur is maples learning business but also people taking time out of their busy schedule to be a volunteer their time and talent ... well ... folks\nWere starting early this year but we really want to hit the ground running with is the Christmas clearing house you can\nDonate money if you so she can donate\nGeneral needs like whether it's toys specific things I'm wish lists or as you said Neal cleaning supplies ... or and this is what I really encourage you to do folks adopt the family that way you kind of get to know a family personally and his was just mentioned doesn't have to\nYou don't have to wait all the way to Christmas sure to be a Thanksgiving thing to them slowly so again if folks are interested in any of these opportunities the Christmas clearing house and volunteering maybe hook up their nonprofit or their church with hands on river region how can they get into it\nTo six for three three three five or hands on ever region dot org and I encourage folks I'm just that Internet guy maybe millennials thing ends on river region dot org rule Leslie Barker on a thank you so much for joining the jelly will come back to viewpoint again I'm your host Julie clerk and joining me now on the show\nSo I'm well this is the ... the single statistic that drives me the most is that three out of five girls ends up being trafficked\nAnd this is just such a heinous statistic I after Eighteen years I still can't get my arms around that\nIt it is a human tragedy if we did not intervene it it is literally human\nTrafficking joy when people come and talk to me and they they say they're interested in adoption out of the box generally I say something like\nI Want you to know I'm not here to help you complete your family like we may do that along the way\nBut I'm here to rescue kids every child who was adopted is snatched out of that pool of statistics there is a child who won't be pushed by despair to suicide there as a child who won't be pushed by hunger into crime there is a child who won't be\nTricked do otherwise forced into human trafficking\nOkay and before we go on let's tell the folks out there are a little bit of your own personal history where you've worked and how you came to this\nAnd thank you so much I I I mean I I Love telling this because in Nineteen Ninety six I served as a regional director with the international Bible society\nUp as a part of my job I traveled around the world so that when I sat with you or I spoke and your church I could tell you about programs of the Bible society translation projects et cetera et cetera\nWe were involved at that time it was soon after the fall of the of the Soviet Union and the Bible society was putting age appropriate scripture in the hands of every institutionalized or a friend in the former Soviet Union more than a million kids\nI was invited to take a trip to observe that program I took my oldest son I it was part of my job I expected to of course do my job\nI didn't expect that within twenty four hours those children crawled inside both my son's in the hearts and changed us to this day\nI'm that son is now in his thirties he's still deeply involved with what we do um\nI I Can't imagine doing anything else with my life I I began bending\nAnd finally in Nineteen Ninety nine I spun off in the Bible society to form the roots of what is now bridges of faith can I tell you a story about the definitely\nI was leading a a a Bible camp in an orphanage and there was a little girl named um ... she was Thirteen Years old blonde hair blue eyes beautiful child full of life gorgeous smile\nDuring the second week of that outrage I had the opportunity to sit with ... on a bench with an interpreter and ask her about her life she told me that when she was nine years old a family wanted to adopt her\nWhen I asked the obvious question why didn't you go running\n... this is her ... every ... every orphan dream to be adopted no matter what they say they dream of of belonging to a family\nSo at age nine and um this family who want it to adopt her couldn't or wouldn't take her little brother\n... looked at me and she said I had to stay and look after my little brother\nWow here I Am sitting there with all the advantages of being an American\nAll the advantages of having a great job all the advantages of having security in life\nAnd here's a Thirteen year old girl telling me how she gave up her fantasy life at age nine to cure for someone whom she perceived to be more vulnerable than herself or the challenge to my heart I Believe from God\nWas what was I going to do I would I respond to that it made my decision to spin off from the Bible says that an end to create an organization focused on helping those kids\nWell and as you mentioned before and I I really want to give people a realistic\nImage of what goes on ... is a lot of times people will look at charity will here people speaking about it and\nI think at the wrong impression I get the squeaky clean everything's hunky dory because we believe in or good but now the a lot of these children are in squalor or their their destitute and as you said you've talked about human trafficking suicide rates um\nBut even with that facing something are so dire somebody like this little girl help somebody out and you've mentioned that it\nIt changed you\nIn what particular ways did it change your I Want to give that that deep down to the defined values you may be attained out of it um and the lessons you've learned\nI was so challenged by the decisions he made obviously an age nine she didn't realize all the ramifications but she didn't know that she was giving up her fantasy to care for someone who needed her help\nFor me I had a great job I was on a fast career track in the nonprofit world than what the Bible society\nI made a conscious decision to abandon that and to create an ... I didn't even know what that would mean for me right but I can tell you that at this point in my life\nI have I have worked for a garbage dump populations in Mexico city I've been in the Philippines jungles helping people there I've been in the Guatemalan jungle I helped to complete the Chihuahua translation for the Malawi people in Africa I helped to smuggle\nBibles into restricted access Middle Eastern countries and not declare Christ and more buildings with cameras in sickles then you can shake a stick at but I can tell you nothing has struck me as more sacred or more profound\nThan doing what we're doing now to bring these kids to see eighty percent of them\nThose who come find adoptive homes which means they are snatched from those horrible statistics their lives were changed I I I Can't imagine doing anything else with my life I Will spend the next chapter in my life doing this\nAnd I can't even tell you I Know exactly what that means but I Will spend the next chapter about life doing this\nFor talking to Tom ... president of bridges a face um\nAnd you can visit their website it's W. W. W. dot bridges of face all in one word no spaces dot com\nOr I Want to go on now that you you've talked about the inspiration for ... creating this organization\nAnd you mentioned some of the wonderful things you've done 'em but how can other people get involved and how has this organization evolved over the past several years\nIt's really a fascinating story what we started doing ... years ago at the at inception\nWish to be volunteer driven\nSo right now bridges of faith with the hundred and forty acre retreat center thirty four buildings all that goes along with taking care of that with the work that we do in Ukraine with kids there we are entirely volunteer driven my wife and I are the only ones who live out of this organization\nYes we do have full time staff they raise their own support their retired they have some other way of I'm supporting themselves we we do provide housing for those who live on campus\nBut gosh there's an army of volunteers it takes hundreds of people to put on one of these one month initiatives with Ukrainian orphans a different group brings supper in every night\nThat along with of course the strategy there is the underlying premise of our program that if we put orphans in front of people\nThat they'll see the need it will grip their hearts and it will change them interestingly I've seen this play out a number of times a woman is interested generically in adoption right she comes and she has her at best neutral husband into\nThey arrive at British down and they began working with kids interacting some child takes the poor guy's hand looks in his eyes engages in with a ball or some other activity\nBefore they leave the husband because I think because men are so visual and we as men we want to rescue people we want to help people ride\nHe sees this this child and the child becomes has got cause when they leave the camp as it's not the wife driving the process it's the husband and she's into\nIt's really interesting well and I'm I'm looking at some of the pictures here you offer you provide me with a book here a lot of these orphans are working at your organization being\nMeeting people and it it's phenomenal and I imagine people have questions about most people in the United states don't know of any other language besides English and imagine most Ukrainian children don't necessarily know English or a is there a language barrier or is it that really not a factor\nThere is a language barrier but it's not nearly as big a factor as many people think it will be\nUm been utility prices are high nowadays so um how how would they call and what does that experience like God my utility bills are too high I'm having trouble putting food on the table and probably can't do Christmas sure\nSure well it's my job in the job with my staff on a daily basis to be out in the community know what resources exist develop relationships with those organizations\nAh maintain the accurate information about what their organizations do and how they help people and then we put that all into a database and so when people call\n'em they typically let us know where they're calling from give us a brief description of their need and then we will access our resource database and give them information about resources in their community or their neighborhood in fact\nThat can help them um I think probably our number one call is and has always been and will always be a for those basic needs type resources\nAnd uh we find that those types of calls ebb and flow throughout the time of year and this time of year they're high\nAnd so it's through our partnership with organizations that provide the service and that we're able to link these people in need to them seamlessly to the style ... to one one well\nAnd it it seems people will not be shy if somebody's going hungry they're going to do something about it but I wanted to point out some of the other services and and also ah before you leave today joy and we have to go into who or some of these groups you're getting information on and what do they do for the community\nUm some of the particular nonprofits but some of the other services to one one can link or color to as\nThings I wouldn't have thought of my head of physical and mental health um so we're talking about\nAnd it's abuse um looks as though people don't have health insurance how who are you partnering with for these services and how does that\nI'm sure it's primarily organizations in our community that are non profit for this specific need a we rely heavily on the Montgomery area mental health authority um organizations like lighthouse counseling center I'm the chemical addictions program does types of resources that\nHelp people who may not be able to help themselves either whether it's financially a lot of our callers need these services but they don't necessarily have the financial means to pay for them so we look for organizations that target people\nUm that struggle with you know just picking up the phone book and calling and writing the check for the service that we we really cater to people that\nUm need that guidance to find the organization that will serve them at low or no cost\nOn in particular um this category of services um especially mental health and um domestic abuse\nSexual violence um it it all is it's not your traditional I'm going to call nine one one sort of thing you should especially in the violence situations\nBut it's for some reason or something people don't want to talk about as openly and imagined a from my own research\nAs which actually happened to the the police are always the best people to handle the situation they are usually the ones who come and stop\nThe crime it's going on and then they figure out who's to blame there's maybe not the certain type of training or sensitivity to figuring out what people need so I I really encourage folks coal instead of nine one one to one one if you know somebody who has\nA a a mental health issue or a ... if they need help or somebody has a drug and alcohol problems of\nAll these things really this is why I loved to one one because it is filling the space that as much needed and it I imagine I wanted to ask you know how has this develop you still distorting the nineties how has this the develops slowly but surely\nWell a long story short um the United way has been around and it's always been a pillar of the community uh and known as the organization that knows how to help people and so what was occurring was they were getting calls\nOn a regular basis over and over from people that needed help and the United way as a fundraising organization um and there are staffed by people that um you know raise funds and so they they weren't necessarily equipped to provide this information or for all over the phone\nSo this concept um was being created through across the country um and\nIt was determined that we needed an easy way in an easy\nThing for people to remember how to reach us and so we were looking at the what they called the in one one system nine one one for one one\nWe now have three one one five one one it's it's endless [laughter] um but we were able to reserve to one one and so that's how it became what it is and primarily here locally and throughout the south east the first call center\nWas in Atlanta Georgia in Nineteen Ninety seven\nUm Alabama became the fourth state in the country um to get to on one services and that is because\nOf our leaders right here in Montgomery I'm Charlie colon who's the former director of the

W ac me\nOr if you will anti abortion but I don't hate anyone including people who perform abortions or who have had one yet some people who don't even know me I've decided that I have certain people\nActually collusion is that there are people who do have those who disagree with them and say logical is incorrectly assume that if they hate people they disagree with then everyone does\nWell today the big focus on hate is our commander in chief and those who supported\nAs we're seeing today hey we'll often morph into violence all of the politically related violence that I've seen in our nation in the past couple of years comes from those on the political far left the specifically includes antifa anti or what does your column or a classic example is a fascist Nazis\nBut we see people who are active in politics or elected officials or even people who just wear a garment with the conservative political simple or message they're being attacked\nSo far most of the attacks have been verbal but some of the physical these hate motivated attacks on people are totally contrary to the way of life in a constitutional republic like ours\nAnd then we have members of Congress with other leaders openly advocating violence against their opponents including the president worse they go and condemned by anyone including the media\nThis is open rejection of our constitution disagreement is not only okay if at least a rational discussion that can lead to a positive change we don't want everyone to think the same way this is the culture of socialist fascism communist societies ... yet it's sure appears that this is the path our nation is on the haters anyway\nI have descended with my life the right of our citizens to peacefully protest against things they disagree with what that does not include screaming in the face of the legislator disrupting government meetings are blocking access to buildings I guess it does include rushing like an idiot and parading around\nBut to you know that when those groups do have their gatherings are parades they leave tons of trash\nAnd our country doesn't need this attitude as a part of our culture\nNoses the mainstream media seems to support this hateful approach towards our president\nHe certainly is not perfect but he's already done a significant number of very positive things including a vastly improved economy was the company the lowest unemployment rates and lowest number of people on welfare decades\nHis foreign policies is returning respect ordination hey look at ambassador Nikki Haley in the UN was Korea look at Israel and now we're dealing with China and Russia and Iran from a position of strength yet he's still hate that\nPresident Trump is to address the family Research Council a Christian group they believe that homosexuals soon so some have called them a hate group and they're putting Trump down for speaking to a hate group\nAnd look at justice cabinet he received death threats his home was vandalized and his family threatened and he's not the only one people attack like this are hostile to our constitution what they want is for all of us to think and speak only what they approve\nMy greatest fear is that the clear if unstated goal of the radical far left is to overthrow our constitution they're attacking our president with a goal of getting removed and a constitutional republic the way one deals with an unlike elected official is working to get him or her replaced in the next election not violence like we see today\nViolence is the exact way Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party took over the parliamentary democracy of Germany prior to World War two\nWe have to stop the hate filled comments and returned to intelligence dialogue we don't have to agree with each other on everything I don't think that's possible anyway we do have to take the hate out of the communication\nI pray for hate filled people hating her saliva hate are much more than it hurts the target of the have the political hate also hurts our nation our kids just by grow up thinking that such behavior is acceptable\nTroops with someone yesterday talk just and it leaves necessary if there is talk of violence suggests that as he legal an anti freedom and you plan to call the police what happens we have to take our nation back from the haters while we still have a constitutional republic and those are my comments for today\nOr this is colonel down a hill and you're listening to front lines of freedom that we get to enjoy some more wisdom was Chief Warrant officer role nationally but after they roll\nOr colonel learn the fit of the political season with midterm elections just around the corner or however the department of defense so strict rules about how members of the U.S military can participate in politics so what do these rules cover\nThe department of defense encourages active duty members to vote in established several programs to help active duty personnel register and cast absentee ballots\nBut when it comes to actively campaigning for a specific political candidate the military draws the line it should be noted that these prohibitions do not apply to members of the national guard and reserve unless of course are currently serving on active duty [noise]\nNow while active duty military members can and should vote they also may express it personal opinion on political candidates in issues they just can't express those opinions as a representative of the department of defense or the military\nOr active duty members can sign a petition for specific legislative action or a petition to place the candidates name on an official election ballot\nThey can also write a letter to the editor expressing their personal views on public issues or political candidates however if the letter Dennis ... of member as a member of the military and must clearly stated that the views are expressed are those are the individual and not the department of defense\nNow here's one I thought was kind of interesting colonel maybe and solve this when you were on active duty\nA political bumper sticker can be put on a military members personal vehicle however large banners are signs are not allowed what this means as a yard sign in a military members home\nThat's a military members can still attend rallies fundraising activities or an all the other things that we would do as a normal citizen as long as they're not in uniform and not creating the appearance of any military sponsorship or approval\nWell here's an interesting one military members cannot speak before a partisan political gathering including any gathering that promotes a partisan political party candidate or cause\nIn general active duty military members should avoid any activity that may be reasonably viewed as directly or indirectly associated in the department of defense or the department of homeland security was a partisan political activity [noise] makes us\nNo active duty military members may also not hold any civil office and the federal government requires an appointment by the president\nThis prohibition does not apply to retire reserved members however if they'd been called active duty for more than two hundred and Seventy days they actually have to get approval from the secretary of their service to allow them to retain their public office or even run for reelection so just imagine that congressman who's a reserve is\nWho gets recalled active duty to do let's say Afghanistan for a year\nHe actually has the has the service secretary approve him to keep his office\nKind of an interesting perspective isn't it it is a deep well bottom line folks is the military members should get out and vote for the most part they should shy away from get involved in in political race until after they've left the military yes we have some reserve members were also politicians but\nWe don't have any active duty service members who are currently politicians and you know what I think that makes a lot of sense it does civilian control of the military is the right answer I think you rolling very appropriate\nVery timely I appreciate your pal straight ahead on\nThe frontlines of freedom

retire they they don't have to they shouldn't have to completely ... stop their job because I greedy investment company has a smoker that hospital uh-huh into allowing\nThem to sign a contract with

I just want to put my foot through the television talking about nurses didn't work hard and they were you know just a bunch of prima donnas now I Know that these are not been in the hospital yes and I know you know nurse comes in their spends ten minutes for me I'm not one not only one on that floor she's got to look after\nAnd you know ...\nThese people deserve the respect of course their male nurses to right they're out there and there weren't any they're taken care of folks and then not getting the appreciation and they they don't need this this problem that you just mentioned\nWell it's not just nurses you got to your laboratory people ... who who should have a lot more respect and you know they're they're kind of like the unknowns you got the X ray and the radiological paypal or you've got to physical therapy people you've got all the you got all these different aspects\nYou you've got the transportation people you've got the pharmacy\nYou know everybody works as a as a you know as a unit that showed a hospice oiled machine right\nAh but the fact is when you when when a when a hospital\nPuts together a retirement plan and they get snow crude and I'm going to use the word snuck it by the investment or people\nA allowing a contract to be signed that they can't take the money out when they're fifty nine and a half and even though they're stealing board ... is something wrong with that because a lot of people break down and they want to start working part time or they want to work [noise]\nUh somewhere else and keep that job a little bit you know but the fact that they if they're working just one day a month\nThat investment company says you can't have your money and you're like sixty five sixty six seven years oh almost and you can't get any money ...\n... then you have to quit your job so you can get your money that's something wrong with that picture of you know a lot of people when they get to that in half they deserve they said we're we're just doing it so that they cause they spend their money I get that patriot but what if you're fifty nine and a half and you've got a quite a bit of money in there and you want to take some of it out and put it\nWhere it's safer for example because maybe they don't have a safe mode that you could go into and then you're kinda stuck in a\nMode that you don't want to be and they need to put some more liquidity in these things so these four O. one K. is are getting that way fry the I'm I'm Talking ... more bad about for three days in four fifty seven and\nA uh those those plans haven't gotten to where the four oh one case have got ... and they're still not where they need to be ... but\nA lot of them will allow you to take out a what they call a just to withdraw and usually they put in there like fifty nine and a half is usually the the primary age but they can put in their forty five\nThey could put thirty five mhm it's all in the plan documents okay\nIn the in the more liberal it is I see people all the time and trying to borrow their own money out of a for all three bay paying interest they're restricted they don't get their money okay some people would not say if I get it I get the ... but when you're fifty nine and a half and you can get your money I think you went too far with way too far\nSo how can you tap\nYour retirement savings without getting hit with a penalty by the government\nThat's another story but we're going to talk about a centrally or that's called a Seventy two tea you say what is a Seventy two ... ... it's called a Seventy to the distribution of you know\nLet's say you did have a four one K. they would allow you to take some money out before you were fifty nine and a half okay and if you worry they knew you're dealing with a good company okay maybe you could be forty five\nSo you say look I'm going to continue to work\nBut I Need to get a hold of some of that money because I've got children to send the college I got this got that\nAnd ah maybe they set up a program for the for the the new thing with Trump maybe they did and we're going to get more into that\nSo the Seventy two T we'll let you take a distribution of payments over a certain period of time I think it's five years do hope that\nAt a certain amount you can't turn it off\nYou can but if you do then all of them the money gets the penalty okay so if you had a hundred thousand dollars maybe you could take out five thousand dollars or ten thousand whatever the number would be per year with out of the penalty you do have to pay taxes if his before when Ralf no you would not pay taxes on that\nUm the camp grounds get grows right because there's so many people out there and they're they're near and aiding everywhere and and number two and everywhere and there's\nThe port a potty start to smell and you and you you walk by these campgrounds on your way into the venue and you think oh my gosh these people live out here for a few days is gross that just a couple of three days\nWhere does a migraine caravan stop and use the number two on a three thousand miles trip of two thousand miles on this trip is where they go when they go a that was my first and then I started thinking about\nEven in October\nMexico is temperate\nToo warm it's more ... than a than these United States it's hot it's a jungle it's a desert as alternating between don't jungle in desert hot out there where where are you going to get a lawyer for ten thousand people\nLet's say ten thousand people in need a gallon of water a day that's it ten dollars a gallon of water were you when you just had a ten thousand gallon water truck driving behind this care spontaneous can't pay for this or putting few and they're putting clean water and that thing every day [noise]\nYou can't just go to the local gas station and by ten thousand gallons worth of water then work that way\nHere to coordinate this effort and what are they eating you know if you walk and twenty five thirty miles a day that that burn some few people so I started having these thoughts run through my head where where he has all this stuff coming from it all started with because I guess I'm a little child should all started with where they're going to the bathroom\nOr they go in the bathroom had again of toilet paper mange we had ten thousand rolls of toilet paper care of anybody who's carrying a toilet paper [noise] you got to care of and for the ... is a caravan heading north has actually toilet paper care of and behind them [noise] well like vice president Mike Pence yesterday\n[noise] and talking on the Washington Post Web site they had the video of it up\nRevealed who the United states government believes is paying for the care of in the migrate care of it\nI just want to say that a lot of people on this program have speculated that George Soros has paid for this because he has been on record saying he's earmarked hundreds of millions of dollars for migrants\n\nWant on my [noise] let me say this I\nI don't think Soros is quite the Boogie Man everybody thinks he is he he's not a good guy certainly he uses his money for ill or for globalism and corporate ... and trying to dismantle the American way of life and western civilization I totally in the immigrant an agreement with you on that\nBut I don't think he's the Boogie Man everybody thinks you know for example\nOr George Soros cannot singlehandedly finance all the things that George Soros is let's define it doesn't work that way you need more money than he has he has billions but he doesn't have tens of billions are hundreds of billions just to give away or not on an annual basis so there's no way George Soros and enough himself but George Soros is sort of\nPersonification\nYou know he's got the big baggy eyes he's got wrinkles all over his face that that uh you know mad at hair on\nAnd if you wanted a villain out of central casting to represent globalism grabs George Soros said Bonnie come here it was crazy it looked ridiculous evil\nComes to death I'm always amused by that you watch these these movies and and you realize that the casting call went out and said we're looking for I'm morbidly obese mad [laughter] and it and then someone answered is I'm morbidly obese\nI'll be in your movie\nDo you [laughter]\nThat's weird uh we're looking for a hideously ugly woman uh oh\nI'm hideously ugly or can I Try to really\nWell\nIf George does that answer the casting call you say we're looking for a hideously ugly evil looking man who creates his own shadows on his face a\nA hideously ugly evil looking man and criticism shadows on his face can I play a global is and that's kind of what George Soros has become I don't know if it's because he looks that way or if it's\nI don't know how he says named rolls off the tongue everybody's sort of familiar with Soros I mean it's easy sauce [noise]\nBut George Soros isn't singlehandedly doing all this George Soros is in many ways a either a conduit or a puppet of the true global as they need more money than George Soros had for years they relied on the Saudi royal family\n[noise] the Saudi royal family provided a tremendous amount of money to the global is that for even prior to the advent of\nOil being found in Saudi Arabia [noise] it was pretty obvious Saudi Arabia was an important\nWorld player they were already coming online is a pretty important geographical location the Saudi royal family Saudi lands that they held their sort of a crossroads between Europe Asia and Africa\nAnd then once oil was discovered will all hell broke loose and they became more or less important family is on the planet\nMore important far more important than George ... short stories that tens of billions of dollars to Saudi royal family has trillions trains and trillions of dollars most of it underground most but not liquidated and cash but but it's there [noise] you know they have it and they have a lot of cash and that can do a lot of things with a lot of cat and they generate a lot of cash\nFor years the Saudi royal family sort of was one of the people that they weren't the only ones there were others there were other global as enterprises investment banks and and uh\nAnd and other industries of of of global list import\nAnd there were other countries\nChina one or the or wanted to pursue globalism is kind of opened up globalism sort of ran amok noticed they sent they tend to China\nA global as goes and opens up the global frontier [noise]\nBut here's what Mike Pence had to say about who's financing the Central American caravan caravan of so nice and ... you might try to dodge caravan\nRight and it's there's no wonder the media is referring to is the caravan\nCarrying something you might do to the beach you might do on the way to the beach healthcare a beach\nBryant caravan he'll drive your car out drive my car but we'll caravan to the beach and on the way they're maybe we'll stop and get a pizza\nWill stop and get a pizza and if the ladies or whether they're going to drive we'll get some beer with our pizza and wouldn't all nap in the past year the weather ladies drive on our caravan nothing dangerous about a caravan there's nothing in ... and it indicates invasion running vacating the Gulf shores beaches when we caravan down to the beach\nWhere caravan and we're going to vacation we've got inflatable Swiss cheese\nGot porn shorts stint Lourdes\nMaybe a couple of lines mess for the young ones a puddle jumper we're just\nMy parents reveals who is financing the Central American invasion of the southern United States\nHere's what he says\nYeah this is my ... you know does it Baron talking as didn't they didn't want the it's Mike Pence talking\nAnd when he said it when you first read it when you first hear it you think of them make any sense I don't have any money he blamed Venezuela he said this has been financed by Venezuela and fit north to challenge our sovereignty and our border those are the words\nMike Pence by for the United states has financed by Venezuela and you might know anything about Venezuela's\nFinancial solvency right now\nFor a million ... Venezuela ... from the resources perspective from the minerals and and and just resources freshwater and wood and coal petroleum Venezuela's one of the wealthiest planet or one of these countries on the planet\nBut\nVenezuela has so totally wrecked their economy there broke they had no money at all as soon as Venezuela is financing something you can be assured Venezuela's not financing at the average Venezuelans lost over forty pounds the last two years average average Venezuelans are\nThey eat out of dumpsters\nThey they kill rats on the side of the road they eat pigeons Venezuelans are not Venezuela is not financing this Davis thing cost money\nVenezuela can't pay their own bills and keep the lights on\nIf you know anything about Venezuelan the way everything's structured right now China owns about forty nine percent of Venezuela's state run energy company\n... say\nChina owns about forty nine percent of it and in fact China accepts Venezuelan oil as payment for loans that Venezuela can't pay back so China gives them money trying to get some cash\nAnd Venezuela because they can't pay back says well we have all this oil\nAnd they'll ship shipping containers full of oil back to China in fact China knows that Venezuela can't pay back so as soon as they dumped the shipping container empty it in China China sends a shipping containers there that the ships back to Venezuela to get re filled with Venezuelan oil for the next payment that they can't pay\n\nOn the gay marriage issue\nAnd it was unconstitutional and it was illegal but unfortunately it's reality right now it's what they do so you got to kind of go with it until the Supreme Court tells them they can't do that anymore\nI'm All right we're going to say goodbye to seven to nine to ... this very long as someone pointed out the first segment too long for at least one person's to ...\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center says is W.

developers developing in Montgomery and positive quite won't be planning commission\nHelping the people who were\nUp and certainly criteria certain criteria or was put on that committee [noise]\nOkay um I mean as far as your first question about local or the lack of outside developers I'm In the city to Montgomery um [noise] I mean that that is a um [noise] I'm a reality I'm\nI'm I'm I'm always on the opinion that if we don't have people here locally that\nAre willing to develop in certain areas then I think we need to seek you know people come in from the outside\nWell ... and I'm going to add one quick thing Robert because if if you only used outside developers\nThen people would say you're using all these outsiders have perfectly capable confident people here in town to turn your back on on these are local folks who are invested in the city they live in the city why when you use them to urban I mean I think it's a it's a tough situation is a delicate balance\nIt is it is definitely a delicate balance but but yeah I mean if if we if people here locally won't do some things and then I think at at that point in time is when you look to the outside to try to get some ...\nThat means it's as well I think one of those names on them because I think about going and I was everybody was doing spank office building and I don't think company up on bill\n... office building and Montgomery

think we have some some fairly decent I'm pretty good uh planning commission members but um\nYou know what would help them is is having a good comprehensive plan like ... we're in the process of of trying to complete and formulate to help them um God the development decisions that come before the\nEspecially Montgomery where to take them well nobody wants to take them to the\nPawn shop down the

friends over news have you sent you that way they'll appreciate it so we are and number two seven to nine to two and if you want to get into this ten minutes after eleven o'clock or Conan\nJust wanted to mention the Port Arthur\nRefineries in Texas that has gone through several permutations it's now a hundred percent owned by the Saudis can bring oil from anywhere responded there and then sell it to us here and when they threaten that uh if Donald Trump's administrators should those any action to do\nA whole is hostage by raising the price of oil I think that's a major concern because they do have quite a facility there six hundred something thousand barrels a day\nAnd that's not crude that they necessarily get from here refined here and say well here's I can bring dental to Port Arthur from anywhere by it anywhere in the market and sell it to us here at a Jack the price if they want to [noise] that might be part of the ... the\nJust the fact that we sell the military equipment but also they got to their largest split ... right here in Texas well\nAnd they keep in mind to this was the whole deal with the pipelines coming out of Canada the whatever the planes ... whatever they were called over two pipelines ever talk about building a during the Obama administration I didn't want to put in why because Goldman Sachs\nSaid why do you not believe that these suspicious devices were were intended to be fair you know if you if you're not said they sing the news a former President Obama former President Clinton um\nApparently explosive devices showed up at their residences and as an explosive device may have also shown up at the CNN headquarters and in New York ... why why they are and why why would anyone has sent these if it wasn't for nefarious purposes [noise] guys this is exactly\nWhat they want you to believe Donald Trump supporter would two weeks before an election this is what they want you to believe that Donald Trump supporter with two weeks before an election tried to murder former presidents and killed news anchors [noise]\nUnless those suspicions devices were planted within like a foot of the president and were moments away from going off I don't believe I absolutely refuse to believe they weren't legitimately place I I just refuse to believe it\n... ... what what political point are you going to make by blowing up of Clinton's mailbox\nWhat political point are you going to make blown up planes mailbox it just doesn't make any sense it doesn't make any sense so that's all I'm going to say about it until I get more information I don't believe that vice president Pence is speaking right now addressing it will let him sort of a\nSet the tone I guess but I I just I refuse to believe that um other news Reuters reporting yesterday Paul Manafort said nothing damaging and the more interviews or Robert Mueller has oh over that reminds me I Need to get something as I got too much on my mind\nI get to the store to sing a\nRudy Giuliani who obviously represents Donald Trump in this Russia probe told Reuters yesterday that he had spoken demand for his lawyer Kevin downing\nAnd a matter of fact is not saying anything negative about Trump because there's nothing to say that's their that's their position that's their position\nA he said that he's talking the special counsel Robert Mueller quote about a lot of things none of which are incriminating with regard to the president that's Rudy Giuliani's quote so keeping in mind as you're left his friends tried to get you to believe that there's some massive operation underway to take out the president's just not\nNot possible Clinton was the other thing that I wanted above above above above [noise]\nI'll get to it has this this morning who is [noise] ... anybody around here [laughter] um I had a question about\nUm bombings and all of that you\nLet me call you back there and if something does happen I came out to me [noise] well that's odd you called me and then you've got to go that's okay I'm willing to I wanted to put up with an aid for\nWhat's going on right now I'm looking for a particular story that I was just reminded of when I was talking about the man in for Neal and I find that to my ... well that may oh this won't buy it\nIt was it smelled fishy and think about how it started it started with um oh I don't work store oh yeah\nAnd the first story that I heard was that the uh there was a a a package found in his house and finding a bomb bomb Scott detonated it and the wood I was like okay whatever\nWell then I heard a more it's a tale story is saying is they package worship as how they open the packet thyroid bomb carried it to the wood and and the bomb squad that night and I let me run this scenario Bob ... but\nA package shows up at your house you open the package and say hey Bob\nAre you going to take a bomb or a ... away from your house into the woods or you're going around like ... and calls them by their\nI'm going to ruin like hill and call somebody\nOkay well I I thought I Want to make sure I wasn't the only one that that story sounded fishy\nNo it's ... let me tell you on TALK fishy it's fishing on top of fishy ... here's the deal though if you if you any foreign wanted to send a message to the Obamas Clinton's and see it in do you send a bomb that doesn't have been\nNo no no you're a bomb goes off right\nWhen you open the leading to see what's in there and by that\nDon't even remember the Unabomber and the only one that remembers Ted Kaczynski you don't talk to ... because ... brother one time and I tell you that I I assumed that Ted Kaczynski was dead at the time he was he was state not gone to glory and er\nI talked to his brother and his brother came as when I was at Penn State his brother came to do a a speech again apparently Ted Kaczynski skills are still alive I looked him up but his brother came to do a speech on the death penalty and how he was against the death penalty\nAnd I'm being anti death penalty I decided to show up see what ... what does arguments were and and he talked a lot about\nHis brother in the case against Ted Kaczynski\nTown um and and this was a bad actor sleep in mind this is the guy who was running all over the place and and trying to blow people up and then you know I mean he was not a good guy by any stretch the imagination [laughter]\nUm but you know if you could if you could make a compelling argument that not even Ted Kaczynski could should get the death penalty then you could make a pretty good argument that almost nobody else can get the death penalty 'cause he's a pretty pretty bad actor [noise] um it was a really fascinating discussion his brother was totally worth it I kind of expected his brother to be a little out there\nNot only was it but anyway the reason we know who Ted Kaczynski is is because the bombs went off\nHis bones went on and and that's that's the first thing I thought about when I saw this wait a minute says because the headline

A. C. they this is bill president and you're listening to real clear radio our our news talk Ninety three point one [noise]\nAnd welcome back to fat guys at the movies with Kevin car let's jump right into the movie reviews well at least I'd like to jump right into the ... there's been a couple of snack foods out there\nAnd and I can't think snap who's the right in terms of you know what is now booming I'll give you the clean version situation normal\nAll fouled up the situation is very normal this happens all the time usually I let the stuff for all off my back I live in Columbus ohio I live in the heartland flyover country I Am not in one of the biggest markets out they're not New York or LA or Chicago I'm not even Cleveland Cleveland gets more screenings and I do\nAnd it is not uncommon for studios to\nNot screened everything in my market and sometimes these huge movies and like I remember the first draft of the world they didn't screening Columbus I had to go to Cincinnati to see it\nFor big movies like that I I Will sometimes do that but it's always irks me if they don't screen it at my local market and we have a big university here there's no reason to not screened things in Columbus there's actually a reason why we're ranked lower\nAnd but I Do sometimes not screened stuff and I let that go but sometimes there's movies that I ask about and this is what this was when it gets me upset\nAnd why then go on the radio unreal on this with a movie like hunter killer I couldn't find a screening or I asked the rap I literally emailed the rap and I'm like hey are you screening this Johnny English\nAnywhere near Columbus and he said no\nI'm Sorry we're not well then I found out that they did now I understand that there is not the budgets to scream something I don't think they screen Johnny English anywhere here but they did scream hunter killer\nThe fact that they had a screaming was actually kind of hidden from the press and that really says something to me\nWhen you actually screen a movie you're showing a movie early\nBut you refused to let press in or even let them know about it you are trying to hide something there is something wrong with your movie if you're doing that it just is too suspicious but there's some movie that didn't have the budget or didn't have the interest it just was hidden from its audience\nAnd it was him from the press and the critics\nYou're obviously worried about bad reviews you're obviously worried about I mean the thing is in this day and age gets out\nPeople know when the movie's garbage they get the sense and the thing is when they show movies that like Thursday night around the country people know by friday morning if it's garbage\nSo you'd not hiding anything so just screen the freaking movie and let let the chips fall and if you made a crappy movie that's on you anyway let's talk about a hundred killer really quickly us submarine commander must wore a Russian plan to overthrow the world's governments from under the Arctic ice in\nThere are a\nLittle road minister what difference does it in the car\nRussian President\nThis movie feels like it should have been made in the eighties but they just forgot\nOr got made and they come out and release it until now I just finished the special effects it starts Gerard Butler Gerard Butler about ten years ago I had a really big career you know it was coming off of three hundred and he was kind of a big stars suddenly a but now he's not the ... and when his last movie was like geo storm\nAnd look I I Love Gerard Butler I think he's a hoot I've interviewed the guy he's kind of a fun guy but he doesn't quite have the same power that used to this thing looks like he's going to stock\nAnd the fact that they didn't screen admitted for breast means to me it probably really sucks\nListening a fat guy that the movies with Kevin ... let's talk really quickly by Johnny English strikes again bumbling spy Johnny English is brought out of retirement to stop a mastermind hack\n\nHe's having I can see them compete in for me [laughter]\nI sure am Madame animal rights I hear that makes it really is you know [noise]\nI mean how important\nThis is another one that wasn't screened I don't know if they were screening it for the public but hiding it desperately from the press but I think the reason that this one wasn't screened is because these movies\nJohnny English movies I think the first one made like twenty five million and the second one didn't even make ten million\nThis one I don't think they're expecting much it was supposed to be a wider release in the theater counts for dwindling down I was like five hundred now I think they're just releasing it out of courtesy these movies tend to do very well overseas across the pond this was already made like a hundred million dollars it's a British movie and it's very dry it's even drier than standard British\nStuff that Americans like\nI'm curious to see it I kinda liked Johnny English movies I like Rowan Atkinson and I like British humor so hopefully I'll get a chance to see it it's just not today but now it has to get a preemptive suck ...\nYou're listening to fat guys at the movies with Kevin car let's talk really quickly about the movie mid nineties I Know I said I was going to talk about free solo in this segment but I'm doing the nineties because I don't have a trailer for\nA Thirteen year old skateboard or makes friends and gets into trouble while growing up in Nineteen nineties Los Angeles\nNow like I said I don't have a trailer for this and there's a reason for it it's not that they couldn't find one it's just that there's so many swear words in this trailer would sound like a conversation between our journey to be be eight it's a very foul mouth trailer because it was about Thirteen year old teenage and you know older kids\nWho are just hanging out and being friends and so just lots of F bombs lots of swear words lots of inappropriate language and this was directed by Jonah Hill and written by Jonah Hill\nAnd of course he's best known for being an actor but you know this is him stretching his directorial legs and try to do something different and I applaud that anytime somebody try something different I applaud that\nThey make movies like this periodically every couple of years you know the all the way going back to like movies like kids or if you remember the spring breakers harming occurring even shows up in this movie where it's like the kids are acting or appropriate or staying inappropriate things they're doing inappropriate things or doing something that's going to trigger some people end up being like oh that's inappropriate and that's\nDangerous or whatever and the response by the filmmakers as well that's what some people do whether you're taking drugs whether you're having sex whether you're swearing whether you're using this sort of language the language that is used even the swearing\nIs a a type of swearing that human politically incorrect now it was very common back in the nineties overall this movie I respect what it's doing I respect what it's trying to do but it is just these kids flopping around it almost feels like a documentary\nAnd while it's somewhat autobiographical it seems to me to properly Jonah Hill's life and also sort of seems like it's a bit of a teenage fantasy there are things have happened to the Thirteen year old kid that you're like yeah no one really that wouldn't happen or if it did happen it didn't happen in that context which did give me a couple I roles\nOverall is not my kind of movie it feels a little bit like a Kevin Smith\nApproach to a movie where it's like well everybody did this and it's like no not really just a small segment of your generation did this is just all the people you knew disordered appeared everybody\nDid all this stuff but while this was popular in the nineties is not what everybody did I think calling at mid nineties is a little bit grand trying to capture an entire segment of a decade rather\nThan just as very sort of narrow counter cultural teenage or experience which is really all it is\nAnd and if you like that sort of thing and it's going to connect with who you're going to love it otherwise it's going to be a chore to watch so it just depends on where your background is I'm going to give it a kind of Iraq's just because I respect what they were doing cat rock [noise]\nThat's the thing that I Need to go to a break and come back and we'll be talking about three solo\nAnd look at all [noise]

three one two three four right\nYou're listening to a fat guy that the movies with Kevin car then that's what I Want to hit really quickly is the fog\nAnd this is getting a limited to re released in theaters this week and part of his 'cause it's John Carpenter by you know what it's been a thirty eight years since the movie came out [noise]\nSo they're uh they're they're giving a re release and you're getting some trickle Blaine is what I thought it was a good time to take a look back on John carpenter's the fog this Nineteen eighty thrillers about that sailors returning to their seaside village a hundred years after they were betrayed and it comes back to the theaters this Halloween\nRainy and maybe that's\nWhy they don't have long\nOne hundred years ago between midnight and water something unknown came out of the fall\n\nOne hundred years ago between midnight and wanted something that came out\nThis is one of the carpenters movies that he made in one of his best runs of his career\nI'm going to stay up 'til the mouth of madness and I talked about that\nA couple of weeks ago that was a great right now there's some singers in there and there are some movies that aren't as good like Mars them Invisible Man I also talked about that relatively recently as a John Carpenter look back that one's an okay movie doesn't quite hold up nowadays\nBut for the most part I mean you had you had the Halloween you had the ball you had the thing you had\nBig trouble in little China you had they live view had prince of darkness you had eventually like I said I'm Out in the mouth of madness he really loses team in the nineties but gosh this is really starting his great run I mean this was a follow up the Halloween and you had\nA fantastic run yet to come because two years later he's going to be doing the thing\nThe other thing that's neat about this is this is relatively early in his career at least as a star director and\nIt has a great cast with like ... and John Houseman and Janet Leigh and of course Tom Atkins is in it and ... and Jamie Lee Curtis and it's a creeping movie but it's a slow burn for a carpenter movie it's it's it's not a high action thrill ride it's only Ninety minutes\nBut it takes time to get through what it needs to do and that's a great way to follow up Halloween because Halloween was relied a lot on the fence and and you know adult as a lot of connective tissue with but it was like ... or something like that so the dog also with the special effects using the fog look\nReally good which was terrible when they re made it back in two thousand five or something like that so this is a this is an indelible movie and even though it's a slower bird and take the time and it has probably more characters that it needs to\nIt it's a great little horror movie and it's it's definitely worth checking out especially if you're a fan of John governor\nOr any of the actors involved someone else to say that the ball totally rocks well

number\n\nThat this is bill ... and you're listening to real clear radio our our news talk Ninety three point one\nQuick a little bit early in this segment and\nOf course last week the ... of the weekend was Halloween that's not a big surprise that wasn't a big surprise everyone wasn't expecting\nIt to do well I was seen productions in the sixteen millions but it ended up winning the weekend was Seventy six million dollars which is a huge amount of money for a horror movie let alone a movie that's the series that's forty years old\nRight now it stand at the number one as the highest grossing Halloween movie even topping Halloween two thousand seven they awful robs zombie remake which had an opening of like twenty six million in theaters which was considered spectacular then and if you remember back to the original Halloween\nI don't know what the opening of that one was but it was pretty low I mean it's final domestic total was like just under fifty million and that's after being played for forty years\nSo Halloween two thousand Eighteen is it was a huge huge huge\nAmount of money for a horror movie to make and this is of course of the post its\nConjuring paranormal activity world but there's a cautionary tale to all this as much as it was cool to see how Halloween when of course he had like go down stars born and then um and goose bumps to those all you know ratcheted down in terms of top ten\nBut Halloween take was huge here's the problem though\nI Do not expect every slasher movie do not expect every Halloween movie to make Seventy six million dollars it's opening weekend if you do that you're a fool and this is what can cause a series of fall apart and this is what can cause box\nOffice to if he chased that box office it can be dangerous for you and here's exactly what will happen\nThey'll make a Halloween too and\nIt's not going to do as well and then they'll do another one and it also won't do as well as any other\nSeries we'll go except for something like the superhero franchises where you build this complex universe with multiple characters over multiple movies the danger of is is that they're going to expect every Halloween movie to at least make over fifty million dollars and then they're going to pull the plug as quickly as again that's what happened in the front of the thirteenth they repeated that\nAnd then they thought oh it's dropped so fast and the second weekend they said well we're in\nOh I said this before the blue mouse model of making these movies for less than ten million dollars and then when it makes thirty million it's still it hit\nA slasher ... craze in the eighties wasn't that these movies were making as much as the star wars movies were making it said they had a steady consistent audience that always came to the movies and watch them and that's what made those movies do so\nSo that's a big caution with this one and we're going to let this weekend only when it's going to make money and money and it made from very bad once we get outside of the Halloween brain once we're in the November and my mom was reading in that I don't expect Halloween for making twenty thirty million dollars I\n\nMean the fact that the movie with Kevin car\nThat's on me the time to roll into the homes and I'm Around them [noise] not a whole\nLot of big ones I think a mama mia came out this week or

up in social media it's certainly something that comes up in traffic\nIf you're listening in your car radio right now you know that and we're going to dig into it with an expert Robert ... is the author of the have the human ah the biology of humans at our best and worst Robert welcomed announced ... thank you so much for being here\nThanks for having me on [noise]\nSo what is the biological route of an angry tweet\nTweeter on line you know at the at the top of our society or at any level of our society for that matter [noise]\nWell it [noise] well we sit in the fish will answer to the question is it's it's complicated\nWhich is to say\nWe're biological organisms uh we're primates were mammals were on the walls and\nWhen a behavior occurs and it could be some awful hostile tweet or it could be some wonderful warm supportive thing or\nIt could be any of those behaviors ambiguous in between when a behavior happens you ask okay where'd that come from and you're actually asking a whole cascade of questions here asking\nSo ... went on to that person's brain one second before that sent those commands to those fingers homeless buttons um but you're also asking what happens seconds to minutes before what sensory events from the environment trigger\nBut you're also asking what went on ours today's before what the hormone levels in the bloodstream at the time have to do with how sensitive the brain would beat those signals\nAnd then you're off and running and what that adolescents have to do with constructing the adult brain even\nChildhood in fetal life and your genes and then what sort of cultures where your ancestors ... constructing because that will have something to do with how you were raised and all the way back to evolutionary pressures in other words if you want to make sense of where a behavior that coming from we're the end products\nOf a long long string of biological influences\nIt seems to me that all in all we do a reasonably good job of a channeling those biological influences into a productive uh channels they say if you take the totality of everything and look what we've accomplished\nAt the same time it's it's it's a little bit difficult to say that they uh that social media and certain aspects of modern life\nHaven't uh exposed the are the more ah a raw and uh and and and got her all elements of of who we are as a human beings how do you think the best deal with that\nWell I think we have to try to bolster self somewhat with looking at one of these these horrific directions aspects of technology social media has

Alabama three six six eight ... this is bill prize or and you're listening to real clear radio our our news talk Ninety three point one\nYou're listening to now it's an endless line Derek Blair were very pleased today to be speaking with Roger ... is the host of the investigation discoveries murdered shows me a rod welcome to science thank you so much for being here today\nThank you thank you for having me it is a very interesting\nWorld that you come from one of a crime and murder an investigation and and I'm Wondering how one that gets started ... down a career path like that or he said that murder chose me for it to the title of your program\nHow did it managed to do that and with your path and does it get ugly different from that of your peers\n[laughter] yeah yeah when I was a three and my mother was a victim up or murderers who shot nine times out of domestic violence type situation\nUm and I guess the title it's uh I'm from a spiritual battle it's based on I think I was pretty destined to do that I think that was the pet that that that God chose for me and made things a lot a lot clearer for me I understood more\nThan than most especially the part where Osama grandparents' experience and often you know all those vulnerabilities and fears and [noise] um grief so it's difficult for me to to work a case in bringing some closure to it I think it was just prepared for that\nAnd is that foundation that training foundation in your life something that you have at the back of your mind or or perhaps in your subconscious when you investigate a crime and how does that shape how you'll pursued a your career and how you pursue cases [noise]\n... you know I think is probably more subconscious than anything I think it's probably the motivation I don't know I just do a passion for it I I feel strangely comfortable at crime scenes and and you know it's kind of feel like is what I'm supposed to be\n... what drives people are in your experience can hear investigation is to uh to the act of murder most often I mean what what brings people to the point that that they would take another a human life in our experience [noise]\nWell I think I think some people just have that propensity for violence and you know it it's always the same thing you know those bill seven instead of at least in Los greed\nYou know those those type things that that kind of drive people and I think when a person wants to control some motor control whatever it is going on in their life that's what they do I mean that's the ultimate control I suppose I think that uh\nYou know violence is something that you know I think everybody is capable of doing it but but I think there are people that that just don't have those those inhibitions or or the mechanism that stops them\nYou know I it's it's almost pulled on to an adult temper tantrum and most times when when it's over with they had that look on their face like what just happened so it's it's a different type of person I guess or or or a person that has no restraints I guess\nWe're speaking with Roger ... is the host of investigation discoveries murder chose me what is the the\nOr center there is a bet most often give away a a murder in their crime that that leads most frequently too there are being arrested and convicted\nPoor and ... do you study the victim in and try to figure out who wouldn't want to kill them and usually there's going to be that person just stands out I think the other thing is that they get they got to tell somebody\nUm and they're gonna do it unless they were complete a psychopath [laughter] most people have that anxiety or that that that psychological pressure on them that that's going to give it away\nBecause they're often a time just based on on resources and budgets and politics and so forth that uh someone isn't assigned to the case or or you just have an investigator that uh is so overwhelmed by their duties and spread so thin that uh you you just have I mean I I guess my question is how often is there are\nA cold case which really ... which really can't be solved a as a result of a resource issues [noise]\nUnfortunately there was a little out of that and it's probably hit the nail right on the head it's usually politics budgets and overworked investigator [laughter]\nI think it requires everything you have an every resource you have to to work a murder you know if you go in in the morning you probably should lead to get it done and I think the the people in charge of the people that all the purse strings are the ones that she just looked at it but you need to get it done\nAnd politically I think I'm the focus should be taken off of some of the things that they focus on like where the person who they are this that and the other end this kind of\nPut an equal playing field out there and and and make it happen\nThings beyond the scope of an investigation that nevertheless critical to the field of what you do a ... ... is the host of a murder shows me on investigation discovery a fascinating intriguing program that says that filled with a drama and\nAnd uh and unfortunately a lot of violence but ah thank you for the work that you do thank you for being with us today announced on his route\nI thank you thanks for having you're listening to now to the News I'm Derek Blair here on the program we feature very bizarre and strange unusual news sometimes it's it's taken out of the headlines and we know that across the United\nStates there are an unusual criminals there unusual animal stories that they'd come to us and\nI'm now we're going to speak about one very interesting a circumstance are related to that theme or that has been put together in a book ah we're we're going to stick to ... Wallace Johnson he is the author of the feather thief beauty obsession\nAnd the natural history heist of the century occur welcomed announcement is thank you for being here\nThank you so much for having me\nCertainly now ... it's quite an interesting story and it dates back to two thousand and nine and and just to give folks uh a sense of of how unusual this is all I I Will describe a the the ... we're talking about here a twenty year old American flag just\nAnd world class famine flight tire his name is Edwin wrist he was a a student at London's royal academy of music and and he stole something very valuable what what is he still\nWho stole two hundred and Ninety nine exotic birds skins from the British Museum of natural history and these are not like what you would see in the public part of the museum or their wings or outstretched these are scientific skin is where their\nTheir wings are drawn tightly against the body and they're they're stored in drawers and thousands of cabinet and and the museum had something like seven hundred and fifty thousand\nBirds [noise] um but but he broke in that night and stole a hundred ... a very select list as species that are are ... are the most sought after in this\nNow some of these feathers were\nOnes that had been collected by Alfred Russell Wallace and those familiar with natural history and the and the history of science in the in the nineteenth century will remember that name or in association with the theory of evolution tell us about him if he could keep\nCompletely independently figure it out the theory of evolution through natural selection he was a self taught naturalist a while in the middle of a malarial fever in the Malay Archipelago and when he wants to keep it all together he wrote it down in an essay any mailed it to Charles Darwin\nAnd uh a couple of years later when he returned home Darwin was famous world over for that theory that I'm not claiming Darwin stole it but he got the the priority or the the the credit for it\nWhile his died in Nineteen Thirteen and a couple of years later his specimens were under threat when German that blends unloaded hundreds of thousands if there might bombs over London [noise]\nLike decades later at the start of the blitz Hitler's liftoff I hit the British Museum twenty eight times and that's what led the curators to basically mobilize this fleet of unmarked truck swear and the dead of night they secreted while essays and Darwin birds out\nYou're listening to now it's the News I'm Derek player [noise]\n\nIf you're a baby boomer with one hundred thousand

right\nGot it for speaking with Daniel Pink he's the author of wind the scientific secrets a perfect timing\nAnother instance of what it seems to be very bad timing in our society that comes up again and again in the news is school schedules for school students it seems like a report after report says\nYou know he's just not good for students who teenagers biologically to wake up early in the morning and\nExpect to have their brains\nOptimally focused and that we should push school there are times back an hour or two but we have this tremendous social pressure and tremendous social structure built around getting up in the morning and everything having to do with child care and uh uh don't work schedules seeming to push back against that how do we bridge that gap\nYeah or maybe ... you have it's spot on at this that is not even a close call you have the ... so ... ... just to the scientific background very briefly is is that all of us have different chronic types of their mentioned early riser really go to sleep early rise late go to sleep late and most of us are\nActually in the middle but uh they're they're they're big affects the age so between the ages of what fourteen and twenty four people end up being moving significantly toward late this become much more like a million to do with being ... and my father a Fifteen year old has nothing to do with being lazy it has everything to do with being Fifteen\nAnd um and so as a result of this the American Academy of pediatrics a has urged schools do not start school\nFor teenagers before eight thirty in the morning and yet\nIn the face of all this evidence\nSchool start times remain the averages in America is about eight or three I Am a and\nIt just it it it just doesn't make any sense and I think that you got it right there on on the reasons why it's it's essentially inconvenient for adults it's inconvenient for adults and we're talking starting school at two in the afternoon we are talking about pushing by this will start to nine nine Fifteen and the school districts that have done this has seemed pretty impressive results lower drop out rate higher test scores\nReduced the incidence of of depression and obesity even decline in teenage car accidents and it's also very cost effective solution any yet it somewhat inconvenience for adults because they might not be able to\nDrop your kid off at school when they want to it's sometimes inconvenient for a lot of coaches who say oh wait a second we need to have hours and hours and hours were letting practices the school was to an early [noise] um but\nYou know I you know it to me the idea that the American Academy of pediatrics is sort of a generic kind of sounding entity but just think of it as all the pediatricians in America linking arms and saying\nPlease school districts don't do this and yet to many of them are the ones who have changed have have done some great work but somehow this is a stubborn a persistent problem\nWell as the father of two teenagers I'm hoping that it's something that we can manage as a society to overcome because I have been in the trenches and I see the effect first hand in it it really is critical as are so many aspects in in terms of timing\nAnd our schedules and the way we work and you outlined them quite well in when the scientific secrets a perfect timing Daniel thank you
