I I Know that ah I I feel bad for him you know it was a balancing no way you gotta have good balance to do that kind of work I mean you know I've never been able to do it and if the if the tight wire was about three feet wide I might be able to do that\nYeah I mean there's a lot of things as a balancing act I mean when I\nUh tried to like a wall when I was a little kid yeah when you first term law you ever seen a little kid a kind of hold her hands out like they hung on balance trying to get balance trying to get balance\nSo from from the beginning of your life really are best for life is kind of like when you first I stand up you're not crawling around any more [laughter] you know sometimes we still have to crawl around but uh when you really start\nWalking mhm you gotta learn how to balance sheets of now there's people just run like crazy and then there but then they do the stupid things like they get on high guide wires are high buildings are are they take their portfolio up where it could fall and cry and ... you know it just a bad balancing next\nMan well you know what they say walking is really just controlled falling yeah you're you're moving forward and you're catching yourself or your feet and your legs and that all coordinates where your brain and your balance and keeps you from falling over a lot of folks I think they miss a few steps that we have you ever seen people do in that uh what is it ...\n... they they run and they'll jump over things like black or in the park or oh okay yeah yeah yeah and then some of them they've they've got a bunch of them now that are actually going up there sneaking up to the top of the tall building ... and there's some of them actually getting killed because they fall off\nAnd they've got people film on them and everything you know when they do and all these stunts as some of 'em right some of them need some medication or something\nOr do you ... your body ... body is all about balance yeah you've got the gyros and I want to call the gyros is your inner ear ... your inner ear is connected to your to your autonomic nervous system and and the bone connect to fulfill bowling what all the time [laughter]\nSo anyway all these things are but the collie negative feedback\nAnd I didn't really realize it so much to when I was in my thirties we moved down to Disney World view you know they do all these rides for the attorney upside down in years setting on your crown and all that kind of stuff yeah and I thought well that is neat but on the way back home\nWe stopped at a some kind of little function at a church that my wife's best friend had yeah and I was standing there\nDrinking a cup of coffee and all of a sudden I found myself own the fellow who you're equilibrium went away it went away and I was spinning around last bond around for three days\nI didn't know what in the world was going on something happened to my job rovers in ... shape something loose on the owner a Himalaya Iran or whatever I don't\nKnow but I don't know wow so I wouldn't you know we've got a little medical background here so I went to the doctor and I found out he said yeah you got an ... died last year I saved oh really what is it essentially if you put your fingers you put one thing or in front of you are\nUh-huh and you travel you know you've seen you've seen where they take the thing and they go back and forth and they say fall on my finger right if when you go to one extreme\nFast yeah you've got to understand this thing and heal your disease so your doctor put his finger out there and moved back and forth yeah and I had an a stagnant you know you're busy my doctor I Would have to tell me that\nMy doctor always says pulled my finger so yeah well that's a different thing I don't know what he does when they pull a thing of it I said you know he's he he beat you pay five bucks you go see [laughter]\nSix months to live here I don't like they're going to get a second opinion okay you're ugly\nIt has a so when you have your portfolio check to see if his balance ... both say yes you're off balance uh\nSo what are you going to do well I mean I'm Sorry you fell down and he became off balance yeah so in this turbulent period of time if your portfolio is not balanced property if you're gyros and your portfolio we're not\nProperly mhm if you don't have a doctor who understands how to correct your portfolios gyro who's so that it balances out in this ...\nYou can fall over one side or the other day and you can hit the floor and they don't feel good them now you're portfolios all stuffed up at ... not good so balancing your portfolio is very very important when we talk about balancing the portfolio in in my business\nUh we like to talk about what we call green yellow and red money mhm the green money is to save money and when it when you get past you know fifty sixty years old I like to have a lot of green so that you a green was they lean and mean ride\nIt out at all yeah or is I'll call it\nYou can get in a wheel or when you're getting old middle aged you'd be right there in the hour when you're in the true middle aged yeah and that's okay you can have a lot of yell or as I call it yellow yellow a little book uh we'll hold your fire yeah you can be you know we are but you know all yell or he got sick\nAnd a head and learned or had to put in math but didn't ruin that for anybody but no but it's sometimes if you're in too much of a will yell or you just get put down you know ...\nHey that rusty I Am only one foot and I'm I'm Still hold it in my ... here I Am\nActually a good balance you look like a flamingo if you had all markup paint jak and I think you were at the beach or something like that could have been changed his foot and amazing that has meant that is amazing I have\nTo be good to balancing things are balanced portfolio is all the time but I got to be able to balance my body to that's right because if you didn't you tip over\nAnd I'd I'd probably talk about you and if you hit the floor just like when you hit the lack of wouldn't ... cleats uh jumped over his portfolio ... uh you gotta be careful about these proposals you don't want to hit the floor man I'm\nTelling you would you know as I found out in in in later years those floors\nAre harder than it used to be um Tyler's don't bounce back like only ... in break just they can ... we know that for a fact in the end if you got a portfolio you want to get\nBalanced to seven nine seven four three one that put you in touch with David aren't as now you said that I mean you take the time\nYou set a gas that that will be the other day for a couple of hours yeah and you were talking and and telling your stuff and you tell him stuff and I mean you know to make you understand what you can do for you to uh to ensure that a road financial stability I mean those are good things to learn\nOh absolutely you know often people they they lack to take final financial risk I understand that I'm not against it yeah okay I don't think that I'm against it\nI Believe that people should accept some risk and that is why we went to it in the uh you know segment earlier ... talking about the risk and the portfolio and risk and powers you know the book with a grain yellow and yeah and the red money\nBut uh and you know sometimes it's feared and it should be feared I mean when you Dan and you're a good thing because this things about falling for he'll maybe you need to get in a defensive mode and I'm not saying that take everything and put it in defense mode I'm not saying that at all I'm just saying maybe you need to\nBe aware that\nHow close to the cliff you might be you know would you need to look down and say well I get a little close to the age here yeah don't really like Wiley Coyote and go over there no there was a you won't catch the road runner and you'll be locked road kill yourself\nYeah because investors that that here's the problem if you deal with a lot of different investment kind of people ... ... absolute safety as they call it they say well that's ... risk of a different way ... we call that\nThe risk of inflation if you don't make enough return\nThan inflation aids your portfolio right it's sort of like a little a little rat knowing down there the inflationary rat\nYou have said hmm portfolio it becomes fat and it it it or is it a little bit at a time nibbles away you might not notice it in a red is rat and that is that ... and then he looked at rag get fat\nUh-huh vain and that yeah that is that\nBut you want is a balancing portfolio he wanted to portfolio that can balance the red green and yellow money and if a rat stars knowing on one side of it ... then you can kind of tailed over in the rat will fall off\nAnd you'll make more money on the other side there you go so but now here's the balancing tricks that I have the most portfolio people don't have and what is that I\nHave a\nA mouse that can become ... in other words the mouse on steroids that balance out the rat is now and and that is that do saying that we can we know how to use\nGreen money and make it ... in ... to ... so you can get [noise] it's sort of like when you recruit a football player yeah and he's a ...\n... and everybody says man why did he walk out there for he's not good and all of a sudden they start coach and they ... and they start working with him and lo and behold the quarterbacks throwing the ball to him they say they come from\nAnd he's put comes into a great great fantastic player [noise]\nThere's a way to coax the slow players into becoming fast players there is a way to coax the big players into becoming bigger players [noise]\nLook at saving look at all these other coaches and they know how to do it so if you had a coach your money your portfolio into becoming more\nYellow and read an acting returns but yet you're stealing the green area then you can balanced portfolio better in a safer way and you make more hay\nAnd that's what you want\nYeah you you you you want to try to make more money safer so if you want to know how to do this\nYou need to come and talk to me I'll show you how it's done in a safer way now if you're younger you know you can take the high risk and the in the ... you should you should take the high road uh-huh\nBut as you get older you need to take the lower safer road more conservative more conservative but we can make your portfolio act like it's on steroids even though you're in the ... area\nYou mentioned a ... you know I got a phone call from last Saturday Night yeah\nHow's that well he was going to put fear string you want to know if I wanted to play [laughter] I told her no go ahead and put water boy in Haiti or you put water boy India you get ... uh well he was carrying the water and he's going to touch down so yeah he did All right\nAh I don't know if you plan on that [laughter]\nYou know a lot of people like coach said believing they've I mean I don't know who couldn't lacking but uh he he is really interesting character all ride or you just don't want to ask him the wrong when you know\nNow because he he'll tell you that the wrong question Ghana\nYou wouldn't want to ask him to coach do I need to balance by act this way and he might say that's a stupid question uh why would you want to do that you might lose a game ... lose your portfolio why would you want to do that he would he would tell you\nHe would tell you that you need to balance out everything you need to have a good a fence with a good defense ... and that's what I'm saying\nYou need to have the off chance on your portfolio and a heavy heavy defence when you're ... you got to have a good balance have yet about have you noticed this year\nI've noticed that a lot more this year that uh they'll make a call and then they'll go right to the typing review it and some of the calls have been well that wasn't exactly what happened and\nHappened ... this is what's gonna happen now right wouldn't that\nBe great if if like when you were were doing something like ah you're going to move some of your ...\nBut as soon as you did it the referee would come in and stop the game and review the play and make sure it was a good one\nYeah well see that don't happen no you need a salary should go back in time they exactly you need to get somebody who's going to do that both forehand\nAnd and on the issue that's what I'm Talking about ... been doing it Thirty years David Ernest to seven nine seven four three want when did you get your name little striped shirts and little flag to throw him out of there is a flag out right now I mean I don't I don't know where we are our\nWeather's radios bin of his shows being broadcast right now what happened to the stock market or didn't happen\nBut right at this point in time this ... this stock markets thrown flags mhm there's flags all over the place and be careful you know when there's a car race and they get the they get the the the danger ... cautions like you had a slow down you're going to\nMaybe you need to get off from the get off the track because if you don't you might not be coming back\nYou know that a NASCAR race and basically just to two hundred mile an hour left her\nYeah that's basically what it but people love it but I Know I've been on that track people crazy what at the top of that yeah yeah I don't know when my car one time out of this was long long long time ago we got on a\nI've been up there but I've not been able to try to get it you kind of get some speed to keep it thing you've got to get it up on is almost like I'll watch what's the what's the ... the degree of I angle on that I don't know but it's pretty state uh do you view you fall off\nSo if you're not running your portfolio with the rise plead the ... you can fall off too but certainly not going to make enough of when to hang in there yeah\nYou've got to you've got to have enough speed\nOn the portfolio in your in your in your in your in the turn the turn lane of getting older when you pass fifty you need to be making that left in the hour that right turn ... because if you don't you just might fall off your portfolio and then the whole thing's over\nWould just be a big old mess is right that's a technical term for messing up your portfolio that's a big mess so balancing\nEven in the or even in the you know the the race cars ... they have to be balanced right they got to be able to stay up on their curve ... on the curb that they're running now\nOr you can call in the book polio golly the stadium you don't want a car flying into the stadium you don't want your portfolio flying in to you\nAnd knocking you cuckoo a because what could happen is then you just don't have enough money to make it the rest of your life so what you need to do is you need to ... to ... road with your portfolio\nAnd uh and uh let David aren't as check it out\nYou back on the race track all ready to go you know people say why are you where are you talking to him so much about portfolios and balancing and stuff because at this point in time in this point in time it is dangerous\nUm so that's where we are Randy before we get to ... go ahead\nAnd just you know a lot of people down here in South Texas that are are very concerned about this and we keep seeing this on the media and see what's coming and nobody's even telling us are trying to coach I somehow kicked ourselves and our property in our families and\nAnd it's a big concern you know their safety or safety it just isn't gonna work force and um\nYou know what are we going to do when they get here and the ... will come on our property in our ranchers they have access to our houses are bars are tractors vehicles and\nYou know there's only one way to stand up against it in you know nobody's telling us what's right and wrong and basically we're going to do things the way that we feel have to be\nTaking care of to protect ourselves and there's no concern for that\nNo American people you are you basically just have to suffer [noise] you have to suffer for the dream of open borders so Democrats will have more democratic voters and the chamber of commerce will have cheap migrant labor\nThey want cheap labor they want to never ending flow of cheap labor which ultimately ensure that we lose America\nPeriod that's just that's just it we don't have public schools that are in coal catering American history and Craig surely is with us now a story an extraordinary author a founder of ah surely bands for public affairs and dish and everything else he does\nBut Craig the more I see this is this coverage is a sob story coverage of the caravan the more I think about what these individuals would do if someone [noise]\nBreached their threshold in their own homes and whether they would ... you know welcome them in give them food shelter tell him to stay a while would they not\nWelcome aren't allowed it though of course not and we know or you know the answer of Mexico when they invaded their country is is that the assaulted the police officers there\nWell first of all we need to stop calling this a caravan of ... justice is fun comical or fodder a car you know a circus or something like this this is a mob of illegals that's all it is no no better no more no\nInvasion it's an invasion\nPrecisely and these everybody everybody is a member of Congress swore the oath to protect the United states 'cause all enemies foreign and domestic right from the president on down every member of Congress they are a duty bound to protect this country against all enemies foreign and domestic and these these illegals\nAnd if they're not they should resign their office\nI think again the fact that\nWe are not all hands on deck to stop this right and that I mean the president is apparently the only person willing to really cold is what it is\nWe don't violate the immigration laws of Guatemala Mexico you only ignore the rule of law in are about to do it in this country right what what are you better than the older they're not criminals well ... well they have no respect for country's sovereignty or borders period\nWhich makes them criminals that the fact to make some criminals and that's why a gotta stop treating this as a PR disaster this is you know for a political standpoint\nThis is this is Lana from heaven for people like yourself myself others or concerned about the sovereignty of this country now we've got now instead of a trick or them ... you know sneaky over to the cover of darkness or climbing fences or whatever now we've got an open massive out in the daylight and Beijing if this doesn't\nScare the bejesus out of middle America that nothing will\nRun again we want we want people to come to our country who respected enough to ... do not violate law the first chance they get or game the system that is in\nYou know as the game the system as it's as it exists anyway well this is talk now is if you want to claim asylum you come here you go to a port of entry and you say I claim asylum then we have to process them into the country then we don't really bad for them so we really some most of them don't show up that's it but\nI I Would but I but I wouldn't I I don't like the word asylum because asylum to me means somebody\nIn the United states because of political oppression\nIs that these people are not politically oppressed there's there's no such thing\nAs economic asylum so only political asylum and so if you come here for the good news for the free stuff for the handouts for the welfare for the food stamps is that you're not coming here for asylum you're just coming here to to you know uh to you know to you know on yourself off on society without giving anything back with these people\nAre were wanted and their own country anyway but the fact is is that they need to go back\nWell and again the president seems to have the pulse of the people again better than any other American politician on us I mean I'm Talking I was I was a shopping with the kids over the weekend\n[noise] and you know I'm In my my mom soccer clothes and have my son goes on and nobody knows why nobody knows who I Am and I had with my with my camouflage baseball cap off [laughter]\nAnd uh I'm listening to people's conversations about those people were outraged outraged about this\nYeah the same ... or I look to is is that we're we're grocery stores weekend or listening people everybody was talking about this and everybody was outraged about there's nobody is nobody Cynthia with us except for the elites but the funny thing is that the elites never let these illegals into the neighborhoods anyway\nNow at a bingo well they want they they don't want their classrooms filled with people who speak multiple languages don't speak English\nOr grooms no they don't want their backyards yes there are private they're private schools\nAnd there's nothing to do with skin color where you come from it come has everything to do with the fact that this becomes a burden on the system if you don't have an orderly process of immigration period in ... it's it's just absurd let's let some I Wonder\nIf that's the thing Trump needs to ram home and the Republican Party and anybody concerned about the rule laws every one of these people in this movable mob of illegals could apply for citizenship all they have to do is go to the process\nI Know they they don't want to do that\nYou know that is not a justification for asylum because your country is corrupt well welcome to the most of the world\nIs precisely then go back and change your government\nNo no one wants to go back and change of government they want to just you know get on to get into the\nMovable mob I liked that mobile mob a mobile mob it's a mobile my mobile\nMob is even better or none of this is what they want you run a caravan is kind of a fun as rollicking group of\nCloud who wouldn't want to Canada and we all want to ... sounds like a lot of for you know let's caravan to the football game that means you got three cars we're also following each other you know they were on the tailgate huh\nYeah that's a David in North Carolina with Craig surely hear David go ahead\nI uh ... Laura we meet ... year the rhetoric or go after and calling for their yeah your ear and in Beijing\nYeah I think that's a crazy just said and I'm going to start doing going forward it's not going to be carrying around this is a mobile mob\nA crank out to play something from your dear friend John made some\nWho has moved so far left now that he's on a regular panelist on MSNBC this is what he said about the Democrats' chances of a massive blue waves leave now slipping away\nBecause of cabin on probably this immigration and these great numbers on the economy that came out today with Trump's approval Republicans approval way way up a much less than\nTrump is not a wholly new force in American politics he's but he is the most vivid manifestation of many of our worst characteristics you know the constitution was written for moments like this it assumed that we we're sinful and driven by ambition and appetite and greed\nIs why they made it so hard for us to get anything done\nThey basically bad that we would get things wrong more often than we get them right and we're proven them correct uh with with astonishing regularity\nReaction to that\nBut I I agree with his analysis of the constitution but to what end to what point I don't understand the point he was making is is that what is Trump gun to violate the constitution sounds like Trump is supporting the constitution the liberals we're we're we're we're both in the constitution so I ... I don't understand his point\nNo I I again it's we're sinful because we elected Trump that's it that's why we're sinful and that one of the because of of all this other stuff that's happened and criminality and pornography and all the other things that we've embrace we're sinful because we elected Trump\nBy the way just a racket I think the uh the blue wave is going to turn out to be a a a leaky faucet about\nUm [noise]\nI I just there's nothing I sense out there there's no you remember Ninety four you could feel I mean I felt that there was an upheaval coming against Clinton and the elites are just everywhere is that the Republicans were dominating\nA debate in winning the debate and no and the Democrats were left just defending bill and Hillary who want to do that anyway especially since then we've got\nForty three percent of the two years before is that\nIs as clumsy is Trump is he still talking about issues that are people's minds with its economy with its border with ISIS all those things are on people's minds is that with the Democrats are not talking about anything and then you know from politics is that\nSunday is twelve thirty four thirty in the\nEast marquee market an antique mom will soon have more information on their big bold yard sales coming up ... market an anti war twenty five coliseum boulevard\nChevrolet Master control this is W.

that immigration has changed their area for the worst fifty one percent of voters said they want their congressional candidates to talk about immigration a lot [noise] [noise]\nThat's fascinating less than ten percent of voters support current levels of immigration and to the United states as opposed to eighty one percent of voters who support curbing immigration levels [noise]\nThat's a Harvard Harris Poll that was done at the beginning of this here a stunning thirty five percent said the level should be fewer than two hundred and fifty thousand a year that's a quarter of what we allow in

stop too late fees and over limit charges reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nOf doing that and I think it's in theory is that we\nMake certain our border is secure I encourage Mexican and make certain that they're border is secure and this air protecting their sovereignty or cause\nIs not something that you know people injuring by force is not something that we should\nView as being unacceptable process\nWell this is what your opponent said about you and immigration let's listen\nTo the owners who's very steep do this\nTake no prisoners very personal way of looking at the world people are very good at it [laughter] I just tell people that's what was the guy\nYou've got other choice\nIs as you want to move things forward makes us compromise is try to give some solutions for immigration health\nIs big issues with it for a lot of\nWill be real please you refer people to see one more time\nOh here's the had eight years of Obama what did they do the math of our health care system\nWell you know just this this is going to be language that you hear from liberals\nWhen they don't want to stand on constitutional principles and we hear it over and over I have one of the most she bipartisan record of accomplishment of anyone in the house\nAnd I continue to stand on constitutional principles I Believe in those first principles and I'm going to continue to fight for\nFace family freedom hope an opportunity I Do it every single day and one of the things that we ought\nTo be doing is protecting our nation's\nSovereignty and protecting our borders securing the southern border or in my opponent said he sought building a wall along the southern border was political theater when he was governor\nHe gave valid state issue taxpayer paid for driving certificates to fish one files and illegal aliens team they tend to see a haven for illegal aliens and our general assembly stepped in and stopped that policy\nAnd got rid of it but I guess it's the difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater I fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he gave them\nA dose certificates and I believe we need to end all sanctuary city policies I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end\nThis diversity lottery and I think so brightest would be somebody there at the border welcoming download giving them\nA state issued id and of course we know the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes open up our borders so\nI say life stand firm on this anti what makes certain if these caravans now they cannot just come walking and our country and receiving benefits Tennessee and want to see us to deal with gangs with drug traffickers sex traffickers human draft traffickers and secure the border\nWell again or getting reports from rural Virginia I'm this is now rural Virginia down south West Virginia or illegal immigrants there are again demanding services go off and getting paid in cash\nA and this undermines us a worker of all backgrounds legal immigration\nLegal immigrants and and the like and I think people are beyond set up with us and how it has to stop\nA few hours one Blackburn what what who you are in in the Senate demand of Mitch McConnell what should be done because Republicans have had two years to get this thing\nSquared away and then do anything which I'm personally livid about this there's no reason this mobile mob should be making their way through Mexico if we had handled this asylum issue\nProperly and close these loopholes and funded this wall [noise]\nWell you're exactly right and of course my doctor legislation\nHas passed twice in the house but we couldn't get the Senate to take that up and that is a good place to start and to remind people decide is and executive Menlo program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo it dealing with those issues funding the wall I Am so putting that money on a timetable and developing a timetable for securing that southern border you know large realized walls work\nLong work and what we're trying to do is to keep people out of our country that ought not to be here to keep these gangs out to our country I met with say an angel on the other day and Upper East Tennessee and our heart is broken her thirty seven year old daughter was killed\nBy an illegal alien who had had several\nWere our hands with law enforcement and of course\nHer daughter is dead she is rearing his grandson and that illegal alien went back to Mexico and this is not ...\nIt's it's not right and for these families they want to see justice they want to make certain that we to verify the employers are held responsible\nFor those that are illegal in the country and are working in West him and she I talked to a guy who has a a brick and mortar date a business and\nHe was talking about his masonry business and how difficult it is for him his sons to get work now because they're being under the bed by those that are coming in the country illegally and do the job and many times it is an inferior\nRough totally is and\nAnd then he and his son go in and do it\nRight but he said you know reach these big job full he and his sons to keep their ... in in the or to keep it growing again and so\nThese are real issues and why I Will tell you this I think when people look at the immigration issue they do see it as a security issue not having the borders secured\nEvery challenge the border town every state supporter state and it's one of the fraternal order of police has endorsed to me and my great some tough on crime tough on trafficking truck on\nTough on the drug issues the immigration issue and\nPeople see it as a security issue they see it as an economic issue they see that as an issue that affects them and their community against the law enforcement personnel that are working to keep their community shave\nRaw and again uh we're talking to Marsha Blackburn here on the floor and groom show we've hit the issue of immigration and now the issue of the economy the Republicans are leading by\nA record Fifteen ... percentage points against the Democrats in his mid term cycle of that is music to my ears President Trump promised he was going to do certain things and he's done them\nIncluding on trade and all the Republican establishment was against what he was doing on trade he they have a ... I think they have one of the largest gaps in history also on trade remaining people are embracing what the Republicans are doing this is the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll\nA congresswoman Blackburn and and it it's bearing fruit we're seeing the the results of sticking with this more American focused\nTax cuts pick on China\nGet more manufacturing at home and it's working\n[noise] well it is working and I'm not a fan of tariffs I like reading fair trade and and west Tennessee where I Am right now we're our farmers our soybean farmers are incredibly concerned about what he was going to end up happening with China\nBut here's the thing China China a trade war on us for decades\nCongress on how do you expect to win the trade war with China without terrorists because if we had been able to do that we would have done that by Twenty years ago right\nThat's right and so what they will say is if we're in a war we got to be sure we win this war and that that is what they want to do\nSo it's tough on China than killing our intellectual property take him reverse engineering drawing her in cooking American Jobs and our owners will say\nHey we cared about we've got to have some great leaflets sure we win this trade war and that we open up markets today are encouraged to buy the election today they are encouraged to ease structuring their agreement and that's the trouble with talks now\nAnd they want to see more lateral\nTrade agreements that are going to open more market fortune the sheep\nKorean people got to hold on or how did it didn't happen yeah I don't mean to a gym sorry Carson but it just didn't happen overnight\nAnd if I mean and I know you're a ... percent of a state that has a lot of rural interest I understand that completely um but and I think for most Americans if it's if it's a choice between soybean farmers having a having a a tougher time or us technology and our military interests being compromised\nIt always ready at new ...\nNow and knew the express market with Russia we prepared goodness meals to go grab and go protein housemates officers you'll be the hero at your next dinner from\nRiverside Chevrolet ...

troubling to five five\nAnd two to five so that's AAA fiber by two to five [noise] Jason's\nWith us in Detroit Michigan and Jason welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDave how're you doing today better than I deserve what's up\nUh we'll just wanted to give you all back story my uh my wife and I just moved from Illinois to Michigan a kind of be closer to all her family up here\nSo uh you know film all over the place but it kind of getting used to everything but uh uh I'm currently unemployed I was just like go in the past couple of months and I'm looking for a job now I I'm an accountant and my wife is a teacher she teaches special education so she currently has a job\nUm my question is we are living with her parents for the time being until probably maybe next summer so until we can buy or on house\nUm we've got about eleven thousand dollars of student debt left between both of us and we've got about that that much in our bank account right now I'm I wasn't sure obviously once I find a job if the best strategy would be to try to knock the debt out as soon as possible and then\nFrom there started to save for a house or what my wife kind of wants to do is just put everything we can toward a down payment to try to you know\nYou're take was in I mean it seems like we should still has some sort of decent downpayment either way I just didn't know how you would feel about that\nOkay I don't recommend that people buy a home when they're broke\nBecause it'll make you broke or it's why they call a mortgage brokers home is not a blessing when you're broke its curse and when you have debt and do not have an emergency fund you're broke\nBy definition so um my advice to folks as always ban and it's not real popular advice and your wife's not like it so you may not do it but my my strong advice to you is to pay off the debt\nAnd save an emergency fund have three to six months of expenses above that save your down payment and then by you know when you buy a home and when you move in the house and there's ten thousand dollar stealing your emergency fund after you move in and you have no payments but the house payment that houses a blessing\nWhen you buy a home where he got eleven thousand dollars in debt and you have no money left in your savings account 'cause you cleaned it out trying to BP and mind you move in a house broken in that Murphy will move in your spare bedroom and bringing his cousins Sallie Mae and they will set up housekeeping and broke desperate stupid in your house or start looking like a country song\nThat's what happens and that's how the house is not a blessing it's a curse when you buy is broke so you guys need to slow down\nThoughts on him live ...\nAnd so more and more is going to insurance cost us the policy gets older less and less is going to the investments\nTo the point that they they cross the line a few years ago and contacted sharing and her husband and said oh now the premium that you're paying one hundred percent of it won't cover the insurance costs\nSo now if you want to keep the insurance not only is zero going to investments but now even more has to be paid to keep the insurance active and that's how far we got in the discussion is what I just said all correct Sharon\nYeah yeah okay and what does face amount of this policy eighty thousand eighty thousand dollars and how much money do you all have\nHow much money that we have from\nYou how much you and your for one k.'s and you're now dailies\nWe we did have retirement account [laughter] I'm I'm I'm a total eighty four thousand mhm\nUm\nWe have a ten thousand dollar they find we I get free or how it's paid for good so [laughter] kind of like\nSo you don't have as much as the cash value is in this uh right now I think that was okay and you have a pension plans as well you know\nOkay and so you're living on Social Security and eighty thousand dollars worth of for my\nHusband found work I have um have thirty six thousand in income and everything and Twenty one thousand and Social Security\nOkay and that's all I I don't work\nIn the face of amount of this policy you said was eighty thousand dollars\nYeah ... we did look into term insurance for him but number one it's really a lot Mark Anthony ... but number two he has to answer a couple of times yeah non Hodgkin's lymphoma and\nSo basically you know it was like yeah very difficult very difficult and well we don't know we we can lower the death benefit\nSo what is the premium how much is that a year\nIf I don't know how much of a having\nA month yeah okay\nWell let's say eight hundred a year and you make thirty six thousand dollars a year\n[noise] um\nWell here's here's the equation and here's the way it works in your mind okay the purpose of this is to give you an extra eighty thousand dollars\nIf he dies before you do okay and so is that worth a hundred bucks at this stage it's there's no investment value whatsoever so we're not going to the only question is you know you you don't have a huge mistake\nOr you've you've got a small mistake and so to double it basically if he were to die would be very helpful\nMhm and so keeping the insurance sounds really good with that in mind\nYeah they they told us that would only last three or four years anyway and they want to make it\nOkay and they're going to make you stop any way they are going to pull the plug on yeah oh yeah okay and at that point you would catch it out and one of her cash value isn't there a\nVan and [laughter] I Would like to get it out now\nYou know one way to get it out and all the way to get it out now is closed policy down right which ... which which means that you would you know if he passes away you'd have the four oh one K. money they're paid for house and be living on Social Security right\nYeah what you probably can make it goes I gotta feeling you guys were frugal people oh yeah and so you probably could make it on that but it's not going to be a dream come true um\n[noise] so they have given you notice that\nI'm\nSixty two are are are I'm Sorry Seventy three or whatever Seventy years old they are going to shut the policy down regardless\n[noise] well I Know I guess if we could be paying enough that it would be over two hundred a month [noise]\nOr are we we could lower than that benefit and and keep going and they found that we could get it which is what I wanted to do it when the cash it out for them\nTo live that we're doing nothing\nYeah there there's not a great answer okay that's why I'm him and hauling a little bit I'm trying to think through it um\nAh\nMy tendency is an eight hundred bucks a year right now to keep it for a while mhm\nOkay I'm Seventy seven dollars a month even if you use the cash value you can have the cash value to begin to pay the premium\nOver ... and\n... you know it's going to do is going to use up some of that eight thousand dollars I'm probably going to do that and let the eight thousand dollars pay the premiums starting today and I'm probably gonna leave it in place a couple of years when it starts being two hundred a month instead of Seventy seven a month at that point I'm probably going to join his tribe and say let's cash it out\nAnd close it down\nBut I don't think it's going to make sense to keep this long for a long long time but probably will keep a couple more years houses health\n\nLike that I was his health oh I'm the first time I went to a cancer free for five years and that kind of have been cancer free for two years good though I mean it goes in and get a head and every every six months I found to make sure it's not coming back of a graph of\nGood good I'm Glad to hear that I said I'm gonna I'm gonna let the a cash value pay the premiums for the next two years and keep it open if a\nAnd I'm going to check on his health at that time it let's say that he's got another episode with cancer going of the time then you pay the premium no matter what it costs\nAnd you keep it open and if he if he's the if the cancers come back at any stage right you keep you keep the thing open at that point but if he's doing really really good\nAnd everything's clean and two years from now you haven't seen a spot nothing's no problems anywhere I'm I'm probably drop and at that point\nOkay that makes sense to me he wouldn't he wouldn't be a sure oh yeah\nYou know but um but but you're also not paying you know three thousand two thousand dollars a year which is what it's going to be at that point yeah which is starting to be ridiculous with that kind of money you could throw money into a investments to start having some money\nAnd um but but at this stage I I I'm I'm hesitant to cancel it it's it's obviously a bad policy it's obviously in a bad thing but it's your only option you're stuck with me now that makes it hard to discuss it hard to think about but I'm\nGoing to hold it two years like the cash value pay it at the end of that time if he's healthy uh and still cancer free I'm dropping it otherwise I'm going to keep it if it's if you got a health issue at that time so good question thank you for calling in and I'm Sorry you had this problem\nFolk you hear me yell and scream about cash value life insurance whole live life insurance universal library blood is rip off you just\nExperienced it you just experienced the back end\nWhat happens if you buy one of those pieces are corrupt policy\nAnd you're sixty eight years old this is what happens is because the money they put in that that stupid but policy will be three hundred grand right now in mutual funds if I had to put it into that in a good investment instead of getting ripped off by there's insurance company\nAnd if she was sitting there with three hundred grand plus the other four one K. I'd have about four hundred thousand bucks plus\nTheir house is paid for she wouldn't even called me\nBut\nInstead guess who's fat sassy instead of her the insurance company so\nWhen your whole life agent says I don't really agree with Dave Ramsey because your whole life I just trying to rip you off\nCount as a whole life agents ignorant and crooked 'cause if you understand these numbers and that story right there and then you still sell this stuff that makes you crooked\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself and if you don't understand these numbers and you're still showing that stuff that makes you ignorant\nAnd you shouldn't be selling their stuff and by the way folks in case you didn't know you don't get screwed up way more often by an enthusiast enthusiastic ignoramus than you will by a con artist\nSo most people out there selling this crap are enthusiastic ignoramus as they're not actual con artist monkey Charlie so with Israelis and enthusiastic ignoramus\nThat's all on called

M. I. P. M. I. stands for private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on un lose money on the foreclosure\n... so it hasn't zero benefit to you under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying\nOkay at ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you write a took a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage he got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone\nIf you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference\nVersus ten percent and so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down you get ... on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the PM I when you pay the loans down to eighty percent of value\nBy buying an appraisal that the mortgage from an appraiser that the mortgage company approves of and then they will drop the PM I later after\nYou get it pay down the fact that we're in fact in California where on ISIS or know fairly high compared to this country makes native\nNow it doesn't make a difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just 'cause you're in California they don't like okay I'll point out doesn't count\nYou know we don't do that so you still gotta use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're at the higher the home prices markets you were in the more difficult this discussion because when you get all the way down to ... percent\nI'm not requiring twenty percent but you get you get J. D. how has much to your advantage\nTo not have this thing to me I Am I\nYeah I mean because you are talking about three or four hundred thousand dollar loan I mean we're talking about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you\nRight [laughter] so that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not but it's so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent then keep killing going on a mortgage keep working your baby steps four five six simultaneous get that mortgage pay down and get that loan reset\nWith an appraiser plant that's approved and then get that pay him I drop so you're not known him for Twenty years\n'cause it just sucks it's just a horrible you know it's just but it's part of the race and it's a it's a logical reason that they require it but it's just super expensive\nAnd it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can because then you get to the business really paying on your mortgage and not just wasted money but yeah I I you know we don't beat up on a first time homebuyer you don't baby step three B. for not putting down twenty percent uh the goal\nAnd we can and not waste any money we don't

was basically his bank account he had no bank account yet\nI'm what I'm wanting to know is how do we kind of go along and do the envelopes hurts them with budgeting has money and putting money away and trying to help and figure out what to do with all his actual\nOkay well I think you teach them how to do a budget and that's where every dollar has a name before the month begins right yeah it sounds like it's a fairly primitive easy budget\nYeah there's not much that there are and they all like Thirteen hundred dollars only are\nYou know and let's get the car paid off and build up an emergency fund and skill that went out um that'll make sense but but um\nYou know we teaching these basic things that you and I both know about apparently you been doing this stuff that we talk about for a while and the hour we're going we're going to be on a budget we're going to avoid that we're going to build up an emergency savings and begin long term investing\nOkay we're going to be generous with some of the money and uh so the whole thing that you get when you got someone that's living in a fairly primitive situation like this meeting no bank account\nYou know he's a young young guy getting started is that ah it's real easy for all that money to just disappear\nYeah and the egg thing you've got to get him doing is being intentional with every dollar\nOkay I'm a I'm a ... she said yes we start out with\nUm I well I get a bank account going like you're talking about and a debit card for that and then you know I I think you just lay it out and say okay you know where do you want to be in five years and what other steps that are going to get you there and so you know how much are you going to spend on entertainment\nOr how much are you going to spend on what's your take to keep your car running gas wise\nAnd your insurance and your car payment and then just just take the income and give every dollar a name ride down the page I mean this is a one page budget you can do

ago but we have a twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance that we um [noise] my\nHusband had hope that we could be used for the kids' college I have one daughter that's in her freshman year of college now and another one that will be starting thanks ball and then two other teenagers and a baby so I'm\nSo this business of making money\nIt's struggling it makes many now but we still have a good bit of debt from how much profit um profit [noise] uh\n[noise] gosh probably well I have to say probably it doesn't make enough to support us over the past few years but I'm going to live in this mythology [laughter]\nUm I don't know we every time he has said okay I Need to go on a jobs and they're it's like that door closes and the business [noise] doors stays open and um [noise]\nBusiness doors not open it's not making enough to support your family\n\nAnd so we need to sit down on this business and give it a deadline that in the next six months it's going to start supporting our family after all these years and making it up to start getting rid of some of his death or we're going to close it I get a job because I don't think you're making any money\n[noise] um am I wrong [noise] well\nI mean we pay ourselves from the business and when I was bringing home about a hundred thousand a year\nBringing oh you're you're taking a hundred thousand dollars out of business yep well that'd be called profit okay you can't live on a hundred thousand dollars\nWell we can we have a lot of\nHow much does have you done\nThe business has got fit about fifty two K. and we personally have about um Ninety six K\nWere you in the business doesn't have any ... your son personally for it okay so that all is now he's got a lot on its own dollars in debt and you have a hundred a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt and you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that all you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit to\nNo that's all we make that's what I mean\nWe are happening all income when you do your taxes is a right to say\nIt has banned that we're meet with an accountant to adjust some things their side that we're taking a distribution instead all profit and\nThat does that change it right but that's how much we're ... we're paying ourselves from the business okay a year\nYou need to find out what the president if you don't know\nWhat can you get back you give me three different answers so you need to find out if you make if your business is making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you guys can't live on her does over here you got other problems [noise] right yeah\nAnd you can pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars is not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go to clean up his dad gummed ... what might\nOkay but it ... the only way that makes sense is if you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the business is making a profit and if it is making a profit what the properties and it's all coming home to pay off these debts mhm\nOr if you want to pay off if it's two thousand at the business and call that business that I don't care but we need to be reducing debt right quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year younger people do\nYour personal I was on a plant I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I Know and we just got ... in the mail today and where to start at okay\nThat's a good start and and I'm going to send your company the book entree leadership on the business side so uh because here's the thing you need to be going no one's gonna quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business\nIn no I'm not going to quit that but what we are saying then is is that we need to fine tune and give a I think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it\nAnd so we need to fine tune our systems at the business the pit profit and loss statements though\nThe budgets at the business and so we know exactly\nWhere every dollar at the businesses going and exactly where it's coming from and then exactly what's coming home and one is taxable income\nAnd then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand dollars worth of\nBetween these two different sets of that and work your way through it you can do both and use the twenty nine thousand towards that go if you don't do that any sort of the joint on thousand that the goal and then you never pay off the debt it was kind of wasted wasn't it so I'm not asking you to blindly throw it at the ... the ... the ... and throwing a system\nAt your business in a system in detail budget at your home and all of that applied directly on this problem so the problem goes away and this went on as part of the solution to that\nBut the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money at home and at

director of operation\nIt was overwhelming running the day to day ... AOL it puts on the job I mean\nWas in it but what really connected with me with how passionate about something a logical this operation we started to get an echo down that led to process the data bases ... development when he ... he became a geek at that than I knew we had to hire and\nUm\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and um you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive or simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nUm there is a researcher out there Michael ... hour who categorize these environmentally sensitive people um and what he found was people who are environmentally sensitive have you know long standing allergies chronic pain fatigue migraines fibromyalgia and just an overt sensitivity to light found electricity\nAnd smells more than maybe me and you do so I could walk in the room and be fine other people could walk into the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place they all get bashes [laughter]\nSo he's environmentally sensitive people actually way way way more paranormal experiences than the general population um there's those higher it's a really high number\nAnd with the thought is is these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on whether it's a federal magnetic fields more than the general population in other words they have a battery antenna or biological radio\nAnd the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment the tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios\nAnd they're picking up on things and that and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up for the general population doesn't\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon it's it's more likely to be detected a registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity\nSo there's science behind it and then there's also signed saying these people are having way more goes way encounters why is that and then that's kind of where we go a little further into that\nThere's some of these people brand and realized how sensitive the yard to picking up these things I mean do they know they get it\nThere and I ... my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive and what you find is\nYou know not only or do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences but it's genetics so their mom did to wear their dad and then their grandma and so forth and so on so this is something kind of like most\nYou know genetic diseases or or whatnot it's kind of passed down from generation\nAnd listen they know they're sensitive to the environment um just by walking into places some people\nYou know like I said get rash of 'em they can't be under me on life some people almost allergic to electricity or for these types of people just experience a different world and and believe me they know it affects them probably more negatively than it does positively\nYou know you talked about some of the reality television shows Brandon and my criticism of them because they always seem that they have to have some kind of ghost Leon donor\nBecause it's television and you know they don't want to do their thirty minute or one hour program and not have anything happen so looks like they create these things and I think that kinda hurts the credibility of some of these episodes don't you\nYeah I think yeah I think it it it really does too because it implies that\nEither people or misinterpreting normal things or there's over fraud and um you know every ... those those people who do this on a regular basis and are genuine no you know out of ten locations that you go to you might have one experience\nIt's really impossible to have you know thirty or forty experiences every time you go to a location because then it's your money in the water and I and then you kind of lean towards that that fries I\nThink we've we've talked about the individual who might have the ability to spot goes to fuel ghost more than others but what about the ghost itself or there's some goes that come back more often than others or because they have an ability to do that\n[noise] um I think it's really\nI guess which one is stronger and when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes if if I'm really sensitive to it I'm going to pick up goes way encounters a lot more than everyone else so I might pick up on a boat for encounter a civil war soldier I'm very often if I'm really sense\nI mean a good a good radio or real good radio probably from she crane has the ability to pick up a weak signals from radio station\nAnd isn't that much that way with the person that if that person is a good receiver he or she may be more apt to pick up these ... things\nExactly yeah exactly so you know ... and ... and that that kind of a boil down to the environmental ... for the person um they're going to have way way way more votes encounters and um so I think it has to do to your prior question I think it has to do mainly with the person not so much\nA girlfriend counter or the environment but you have to ask you know hey I'm an environmentally sensitive person I pick up on all this stuff you know I go from place to place to place throughout my day however\nOne location I'm picking up a lot of\nUm having a lot of goes the phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active whereas in other places and so then you start asking yourself why why that place and and why not the other places um so then you have to go into why is the location have more um paranormal phenomenon ...\nOf the other locations you know it's like those antennas we had\nShouldn't picking up channel thirty three and this configuration that you know what I'm saying you have to figure out the right combination of things that happened for um the TV to show up in a clear picture and the same with ghost encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients\nAre variable that line up the habit goes blank out or vocation as one person has to\n'em and then there's there's probably other ones that\nI don't you know we haven't really identified at this point but the person not only their sensitivity but their internal ... electric a consciousness of all this stuff really plays into it and it's really fascinating to me it\nReally is I remember when my dad brought home a better TV him to know\nAnd it was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears but it had like a little uh knob on it that you clicked in and brought into signal better that way too and I thought for use this technology amazing how times have changed Brenda\n[laughter] and I remember those two [laughter]\nDo you or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nUh no I haven't and I'm I get that question a lot though the the theme of question seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so\nI think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great uh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the good with the bad with a positive way that this was at that and I think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's demonic\n... demonic a demon is more of a religious perspective than it is sort of um you know like a scientific perspective so usually whoever classified this is a demon or\nUm you know regular goes I think there's more of a religious pills to us I'm that's why I usually when I meet David knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um I think there's a little little that labeling going on for me it's an experience\nUm and some people perceive it as good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might not the same experience can be terrified and believe it's negative and then kind of you go towards more demonic part of things [laughter]\nSo I I really just enjoyed not enjoy but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the theme and label on anything\nWell was brand new ... his book is called the ghost studies his website ... dot com of course linked up the coast to coast am dot com results on Facebook\nAnd Twitter as well

case studies let's talk a couple of them some of your favorites what do you have\n[noise] sure sure uh but I have several accounts that I go over I'm the first one it actually because Halloween approaching ... go with this one\nPerfect um trick or treat [laughter]\nMy wife passed away unexpectedly over the summer while it's been difficult I managed to care for the house of myself\nAs Halloween approach that was putting up decoration advocated in a neighborhood usually love trick or treating my wife and I had bought a plastic pumpkin together when we first got married Twenty years ago we had places plastic plastic pumpkin at our window every Halloween\nI searched out for days looking for that and so I finally gave up a few days after giving up I was walking down a staircase and I was shocked to see my wife standing at the bottom\nBegan to weep uncontrollably and rushed out to the garage a huge smile came across my faces the plastic punk and was laying behind the workbench it must have fallen off the top shelf so\nThis is a great example of a you mentioned it before and intelligent haunting or goes interacting with us so in this case you know the ghost during his ghosts and counter the ghost had a conscious\nAnd she was actually giving information that the husband wanted\nSo they're aware of their surroundings they they're giving information they're not sort of confined to an area they're interacting with the witness um they're not like routine specific like they don't just show up every day on this or on the twenty fifth the mayor on Christmas Eve or anything like that\nSo this direct interaction um is sort of the ... the cream of the crop when it comes to go slowly encounters\nA and these are the most rare ones that I've been talking with people these are the most rare when you have like um the intelligence the interaction the giving information which is verified um this is sort of what we all seek in a way of those who investigate the paranormal\nZero pecking order on the other side we're in in in your opinion I'm almost forty I mean who sends to goes back to do what it does do it on its own or is there some organization that's involved in doing that on the other side\nI'm a strong believer in in consciousness\nSo you know who who we are as people are are personality our memories are um everything that we are\nUm after we die you know what happens to that right or some people will say that we're just computers and when we die who everything of who we are memories are ... ... it just pieces to exist\nUm and that's kind of mainstream science says you but\nWhen you look at things if consciousness survive death and that goes and it continues to exist\nIt's it could maybe really be in the environment to some degree and I think when needed maybe like ... example with a husband when needed he can sort of resonate or\nOr link up with a consciousness of his past wife so I don't think it's a pecking order as much as you know someone just really needs something and then they sort of resonates with the consciousness of of a path loved one and then these experience maybe half as\nSo yeah you know I I really believe that there's obviously things in the environment that we don't know about and the consciousness I'm electromagnetic fields all this stuff that really happens in the environment\nIs is really important uh Michael per singer who recently passed away but it was a neuropsychologist basically said and he did all of the numbers behind this but that the environment holds enough energy for every every person that ever ever lived their consciousness to exist at it\nUm which means we have access to memories from Abraham Lincoln to Billy the kid it's it's all out there and the environment has enough energy to store all that and then maybe some people can just connect with that or resonate with that and that's when he was great experiences happen\n[noise] what do you say the skeptics Brandon who see these people who have these encounters are mentally unstable or some the name of the war\nYeah unfortunately I think you know when someone tells you a ghost we encounter um a lot of people will just kind of say well you're crazy and they kind of say jokingly but it really makes the other person feel like they're\nSo you you know what I usually tell people who move skeptics or or things like that I usually just basically kind of go over listen you know in in my experience it's all I Do all day is diagnosed um mental health and um you\nKnow you see at all\nYeah I mean my job I I worked in the ER for seven years so I just did behavioral health assessments on metaphors in the ER and I've I've done probably five thousand assessments of over the course of ten years\nUm so I Know how to parcel out you know significant mental health issues and all these real life encounters that I've come across um Ninety nine point nine percent of them are from people who are genuine and had a subjective paranormal experience\nThat's huge yeah you know and and I think that it's easy to say oh you're crazy or this or your dad or your unstable or your looser dating or you're drinking too much or withdrawing or whatever the situation is\nBut less than ... in my professional opinion a lot of these ghosts and counters are ... they're genuine and the people's eyes it's not the result of mental illness\nOnly always found that skepticism as healthy as long as a true skeptic has an open mind\nMhm exactly exactly you know it's it's really easy to beef you know a steadfast believer or a steadfast skeptic right because you can just in golf yourself and whenever you're reading\nJournals magazines books and it's really easy to sort of said on everything is everything is not a goes there everything is it goes\nIt's being in between an open minded that's the most rewarding and challenging because you have to take both sides you have to read a skeptical stuff and you also have to read them believe the believers stuff and you have to have common sense in a way and sort of parcel out what's\nYou know what's fraud are fake or just people being overzealous and then come up with your own conclusions and that's where you're right the open mindedness part is is essential when it comes to\nBeing involved in the paranoia objects for I'm pretty much a majority of my life what changed your you know\nWhen people would tell me and I was really interested in Paris psychology like I said before but I never had an experience so I always kind of thought well these people who are having experiences maybe they're just misinterpreting things and just getting it wrong\nSo when people were telling me experiences I Would kind of sit there and as they are talking I wouldn't even listen to him I Would just sort of go over how to debunk at or what could be happening\nAnd then I just sit back and you know I'm going to start listening and I started listening and I'm like oh okay and then I started picking up books\nLike um Carl Young's collective unconscious right\nShell drag stuff um oh Harold facts numbers life feels during the read Raymond Moody's work\nYes exactly a near death experience it all this stuff and you start reading it and you go wait a minute there's actually this might be happening and then you go deeper down that rabbit hole and you're reading research articles about untangle man and then you kinda go wait a minute this is actually somewhat possible\nAnd then you know as far as ... the and things like that\nI mean the research on that is growing every year um but I Know every year I'm reading\nMore and more journal articles which statistically give credence to the idea that come up with the N E S P and the side phenomenon is legit and then you're like whoa wait a minute if this is saying this and these ghostly encounters could be possible as well and that's kinda what led me into it from a skeptical to more of a believer part effect\nWas another one of my favorite stories\nOr I I got a lot of 'em so uh we'll go with will go with one that's been pretty popular here recently asked to do with dementia is um and just finished eating dinner and was in the kitchen\nIn the dishwasher I happened to look in the dining room I was shocked to see a huge black void about four feet high and four feet wide hovering above the ground I

yesterday that's\nThat's what the Alabama news network is as running on their\nTheir ...\nThat he pled guilty to another charge not related to the murder of his parents huh so ... is is I mean what what what Trump's murder I mean they've been trucking and cocaine from Colombia or\nA well that would be a lesser charge is usually I mean usually they mean lesser included charge um let's see if I got an Alabama news network story here I'm gonna pull it up and see if I can ... can it real fast\nThe press really said the ... states this case was a homicide in that position has been maintained the anticipated testimony the medical examiner would be that they could not classify this case was a homicide beyond a reasonable degree of medical certainty\nA says he okay here we go um\nHe confirmed today murder charges against Jesse Madison holding on to collect it could have been dismissed Holton has pled guilty to an underlying charge unrelated to the death of his parents which is a class B felony that could be a firearms felony maybe I don't know I I don't know the drugs I don't know the answer\nTo that I'm ...

life in short\nHe is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his lifestyle except the ones he himself invents well I like Trump's\nLike Trump or ... he reminds me of a lot of wrestling character\nWell and this is this get this next part gets to your point and says he lacks constraints 'cause he's filthy rich and has always been and unlike other rich man he rebels in wealth and feels no need to apologize for it ever hey never learn to keep Israel opinions to himself because he never had to they never learn to be embarrassed that he is male with ordinary mail proclivities\nSometimes he treated women disgraceful they for which Americans left and right or ashamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton\nI don't know how shame Americans really are I think most Americans don't care right I I'm not going to quote I'm not going to attribute this to any particular person but one woman I Know said\nThis ... after the debate where he said because you'd be in jail\n[laughter] one woman I Know said I'd let him grabbed me by the hootenanny oh wow you know why\nDoes he's a man yeah he's a man's man's also means a man's man\nWell and you know I said do you just a little while ago I the left makes me more angry angrier than the right I Can't send a lot more and I can't stand the right I mean they both do stuff that I can add\nBut you know this was my example like I Want free trade and largely open immigration and all these things I I was like a global community not with global governance but with you know free markets in your piece in foreign policy but when Trump and the Access Hollywood tape came out\nI thought it was funny because I didn't take what he was saying literally\nI took what he was saying is I'm a famous guy and ... and into this little punk Billy Bush or how much I get there it's not a role model it's a guy who's full of bravado exaggerating yet\nAnd I don't know that that's where I'm definitely not a person of the left because I liked the vulgarity I think too many people in Africa posed what somebody has commented on my Facebook page conflate manners an etiquette with intelligence\nJust because you know what the Rehman proper thing is to say does it mean you have an intelligent opinion or the correct opinion and just because somebody uses the F word uses the vulgarity of other type sexual or otherwise doesn't mean they're wrong and how they would advance a country\nWell here here's here's where this guy goes with this because he does contrast in with the left and he says the difference between citizens who hate Mr Trump and those who can live with them whether they love him or merely tolerate him\nComes down to their view of the typical American the farmer the factory hand the auto mechanic machine is Teamsters shop owner clerk software engineer and for treatment truck driver house what the leftist intellectuals I Know say they dislike people insofar as they\nTend to be conservative Republicans ... Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama no they're real sins they know how polling such people are with their stupid guns and the low some churches\nThey have no money or permanent grievances to make them interesting and no Twitter followers to speak of they skipped Davos every year and watch Fox News not even the very best has the dazzling brilliance of a Chuck Schumer not to mention Michelle Obama and truth there as dumb\nAs sheep that's the difference that's\nThe real reason they hate Donald Trump because\nHe's like us he's just a normal guy\nOn steroids sparking trouble like I Know\nThat works in a word it does work at worst beautifully Penn Jillette he was on the celebrity apprentice with Trump and Penn Jillette when asked\nWould you vote for Trump for president Penn Jillette said F. no but he said I loved to hang out with them all day every day yeah and I think that it plays into right what you said now ... says 'cause he's a flaming libertarian\nThere's a great guy to hang out with and he said all sorts of outrageous crap on a reality TV knowing cameras are reading and will you give it to us Mr ... waters races sexist things from the it's like no I'm not going to give it to you I'm not playing are stupid game because it was fun to hang out with them and everybody in the room to what he was doing\n... I just I Can't stand this left wing game or this prim and proper game of Mr Trump is so vulgar and just bringing down the president's see all the president's seat was brought down by idiotic policies and war over two decades I might point out and\nThey were going to go to the phones are because I took a lot of heat when I said this one time but if you're not a cute female and you go missing the odds are no one's really going to go look for you\nNot nationwide you won't be on Fox News you know I'll be on NBC this personal ... missing I might come look for you but but mark ferment is not going to be on Fox News talking about Julie are clerk are missing out is that Nancy looking for me I'm\nRight now they're talking about and I saw this the other day pop up this young woman we met him and it's it's tragic terrified but uh\nIt it just proves that I'm right if you're not a cute white girl young\nThey're not come looking for you there and they're not coming looking for you in the same way it's like the woman who went missing up in Iowa and they later found her in a cornfield and buried or something some illegal immigrants who are the only reason anyone even news you existed\nBut because he was a cute white girl this the same thing with this girl I have no idea where this girl is well you're not be quite alive she might be that why is this controversial I took heat for it because people suggested I was wrong\nWith me the last unattractive girl or in the last male who had a nationwide hunt out for him who was not a fleeting criminal\nThe only time they go look and I mean there there are thousands of missing people on a daily basis in this country house it's the only time they go nationwide hunt is when it's a cute white girl as it\nTo Asian girl not looking to black girl not looking to white girl stopped depressed butter on Fox News let's get it on CNN dot com let's get a judge link where's this girl wears you've got to find that ... ... you know hey I hate to be the one in ... the same\nPeople are shallow and they take into a parent's into account their emotional ... similar to a point I've been making you know make some people squirm say Hillary runs again and camel Harris runs this time they were going to vote for him or her because she's attractive woman and Hillary Clinton is not\nAnd it plays into it in the same way though I think people voted for Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter because Reagan was attractive man to me is not who was the last ugly president we had truly ugly president Richard Nixon\nRight and Nixon Harold Ford was an underwear model right a boy and Nixon and the television Tobago JFK loses 'cause he looks at me Carter wooden oh I'm not saying he's completely ladies do they compare him to Ronald Reagan right he wasn't a movie store and so I think this ... people are emotional\nWe make decisions that we don't just make decisions based on what's the correct policy what's intelligent you\nKnow we can have our emotions played with and all sorts of ways and I think two points stands I haven't seen a lot of missing persons unless it's a young white teenage or or twenties were on the young too white girl she's now she's twenty\nThat's such a difference between Nineteen but you know what I mean I Do to clinch\nTheir day about it my friend\nAnd you get bouncing around today\nWell it's it's just conversations are show do\nAnd then I just really not missing cow okay All right yeah I think no matter what kind of a cow might be okay\nOnly time it makes the news right\nIs if it's a cute white girl I'll give you an example ...

website ... or or you go to the deck a website you can see everything they have but you can go there today in preview nobody no bidding today but until I think four o'clock you can do show up and look at what all they have\nReally really cool stuff really really close to\nAh that that's courtesy of gyms uglier by the way thanks to the gym single single here in the street\nAnd so it'd be great 'cause uh looking for a good Ford yeah a Trump on the uh he can no longer call Warren Pocahontas they said he's limiting himself he's no longer will call her Pocahontas familiar because to be honest you would have to have at least some DNA from Indians and because she has none\nOr he cannot call her he said it's too negligible negligible so we can't call her Pocahontas anymore so she got it passed their um [noise] but did you see he also changed Ted Cruz's nickname\nI did I talked about this was a dynamite they uh they they said to him but I have a down but down but now what do you think about lie in tents and he says no longer lines to these beautiful to Texas had access to it [laughter]\nLove the pain you know we came up with that on the spot on corps and the people are so critical and but you call them lion Ted you called them lion ten you can't go back to you\nKnow but he's beautiful beautiful I call them that if you will be a tougher to Texas to [laughter]\nHe turned his head what he said to Texas I get a kick out of that Donald Trump\nRight there a while like Trump or but\nAnyway he says I no longer call her Pocahontas because she has no Indian blood she doesn't qualify he said I have more Indian blood in her and I have none\n[laughter] I Love I Love him\nHe has a very a very stable gene it so entertaining a very stable genius the rest of the some of this is Alabama stuff and trying to trying to kind of keep it a separated here I don't want to switch in the middle of the same who's on the chicken chicken in\nA a got a question of well the um the caravan of production you know the border of would any terrorists laws apply to them or\nLike when you have in mind\nWell I Know once they break any laws but I mean the main thing is breaking down the answer destroying the border\nYeah um well here's the deal when you said the ... the terrorists laws there are a lot of laws that apply to them that they're not planning on being an forced you understand that right\nRight um\nSo what's one more ... I guess is the way they're looking at it you know\nYoung young man you remember the young man and this\nMay have been before your time Julie and I was a kid I think I was like in my early teens so you'd have been maybe still in diapers I'm not sure who maybe um there was a kid in Singapore who graffiti to the side of a bridge and Singapore do you remember this Carolyn\nAnd he got forty nine lashes as his punishment came lashes where they sell the Cain and water to get it nice and subtle\nAnd then they whip you're asked with this thing and it bloody isn't it blisters in its splits you open in fact it I mean it's really nasty nasty punishment\nI mean I remember there being a lot of outrage from the United states ...\nAnd a lot of we need to get this kid out of there that says upstream punishment for for a for graffiti and they said no no no we also last people for gum gum is outlawed over there\nThat Singapore is like a clean country you don't break the law if you break the law there swift as severe consequences\nAnd it doesn't matter whether you're a foreigner and understand the laws are not swift and severe consequences period and the story\nAnd um I think they ended up painting that kid if I'm not mistaken I don't think he got out but I remember at the time that the lot of people were like well there are a sovereign country\nMan they can enforce the laws that they want to be stricter harsh and if you're a guest and their country you must obey the laws you don't just go walking into a country and doing whatever you want I mean that was like the national conscience in Nineteen Ninety or whenever this was\nBeing scared the hell out of Singapore yeah thinking man I Would\nNever go to sing along visiting there anytime soon oh no no there was a movie along those lines to they were in Thailand or something and one of them had\nMarijuana and they got caught and they were gonna get the death penalty you remember what movie that was also the which one would not exist in ... is that what it was just an old movie like in the eighties is that what it's called dynamite movie or if you uh\nWell it's also like don't drink and Saudi Arabia yeah he did get king us student tells the pain of his campaigning in Saudi Arabia\nThat as a nation Saudi Arabia or I'm Sorry it was a sunny in Singapore smoke I just got Saudi Arabia and the brain um\nYeah there's a Nineteen Ninety four story so it had to be before then as crazy as it uh but anyway yeah chicken man thanks gets called to call a number to seven to nine two to eight a Seymour Mr monetary user morning what's going on\n[noise] um you know I'm thinking about something with the caravan\nAnd was getting ready to go down and fifty years ago it's hard to believe I'm that old I got to look at something and with all the weapons that we have now and then we really don't need to send in troops down there\nAll we need is a couple of unmarked airplanes or helicopters with a few many guns they used to call them puff the magic dragon\nAnd that his [laughter] you know it would take but about ten minutes\nTo take care of business if that's the tech we're going to take because you know the post traumatic stress factor of whoever goes down there to the harm those women and children it'll probably be worse than it was when I came home from Vietnam the eight people somebody spit on me\nWell and this is something that somebody raised me I'm not raised on area but you just prompted in my mind a what a military service member of fire on the civilian like that\nYou'd never know you know I served with Dr trees and when they did away with the draft\nConscription or whatever you want to call it our military and I'm not going to say that 'cause everybody's going to get upset with me but it's there's a big difference than what it was in Nineteen sixty five to around Seventy one\nThe people that are serving than you have now a it was patriotism or whatever a lot of guys like Clinton and some of the chicken hawks they all went to Canada\nBut a lot of us went over there and served and it's like they're trying to expose your get rid of the memory of that you know they are being a Vietnam veteran I can I can sit here and tell you that\nWe have never really gotten any respect yeah and I'll just leave it at that you know there was me lie all that stuff happened and believe it or not a barren tonight they were replaying are burned series\nAnd in this segment I missed the first one to watch the whole thing before it'll be Nineteen fix you talk about a history lesson everybody ought to watch that and watched what happened I live Vietnam January twenty eight Nineteen sixty three days before Ted\nReally besides absolutely I mean there's lots of the list as overtly beside present a but all falls good land and those are all in it sneaks up on people they forget six blocks and I said well than Marshall rented\n[noise]\n\nChevrolet Master control so this is W.

I guess I kind of found a better way to end it but\nYou know so very interesting that the the more interesting back when that happened here in Alabama I happened to you know the\n... oh\nI'm not from here some I have a hard time remembering the staff thank God they had they had said\nShe was eight weeks pregnant ... when he shot and killed their\nHe knew the pregnancy they had ... cent six weeks so\nYou think about that abortion is legal I see I Believe like twenty weeks at least in Alabama and all states in Alabama than us district at eight weeks old this baby lies and this man was convicted of double homicide\nAnd I do which is basically saying hey you killed two people not when you get to\nSo just as ... I can currents which you know not to be this person that plug it in front of the chief justice race he he actually said hey we need to overturn roe versus Wade he say court I'm calling you to overturn this and this is why because\nWe have equal legal protection friend unborn child everywhere in all areas of law except for abortion\nThat's it so why is it so on equal and I think that uniquely sets aside for fighting this fight because he's the Alabama Supreme Court said you know in their main opinion and the concurrence is this a wee child is a person legally and they have the right to life\nWhich goes back to the Nineteen Seventy three rosy weight opinion when justice Blackmon said is that any use the word fetus if the fetus is determined to be a person then the whole abortion argument crumbles because historically\nNow this is how rights to human beings have been subverted is by saying that certain human beings are persons whether it was with the the uh the slave or the American slave movement which people were kidnapped from another continent and brought here and we remember the Dred Scott opinion\nFrom the U.S Supreme Court where African Americans were considered not poor person and that law was overturned so Alabama thank God has a a Supreme Court who has systematically\nEroded at the jurisdiction that roe v Wade controls so ... so double homicide rosy weight has no bearing on double homicide in Alabama deep you guys know where what ... what other places that the Alabama Supreme Court has said\nRosy way doesn't control what and what other areas\nAs an unborn child legally considered a person in Alabama\nWhere the so or other places are chemical endangerment is a mother of a of a uses heroin during pregnancy she can be prosecuted for chemical\nEndangerment of a child in when morally the our state and our legislature intercourse reporting\nThe reality that that is tantamount to a kidnapping somebody putting them in a room and forcibly injecting them with heroin for nine months it's a crime it's it's immoral or another area where the Alabama Supreme Court said rosy way doesn't apply to is in malpractice and wrongful death if an OBGYN commits an act of malpractice\nAs negligent in their duty and results in the death of a child\nThat OBGYN can be sued for wrongful death okay that's a pretty big deal that's a pretty big deal so and so many areas Alabama Supreme Court has said\nYou know we just think ... bad law needs to be thrown out the window the U.S Supreme Court needs to throw it out it has no jurisdiction here\nRight and that's where that was a state of the law before the Supreme Court over reached its power like the bully on the playground and said I'm going to take everybody's lunch money I'm going to you know the U.S Supreme Court said we're going to take this power away from the states even though the states didn't delegate to the federal government\nThe right to control who they can protect for murder and who they can the U.S Supreme Court did that Nineteen Seventy three so\nThe lawsuit that we feel like it's going to break ground and help us move forward it to overturn roe v Wade is taken a plane of let's just say plaintiff may be the father of a child who whose child was aborted without his consent\nOkay that child was killed without his consent can that father to the abortion doctor for wrongful death of that child if the father kids to the the OBGYN for malpractice when his child dies can he sued the abortion doctor for\nOur heads around that that's a game changer let's take an elderly person for example and some places you said hey let me interrupt you\nOn that you know but one prominent do in the state of Alabama is that if a woman gets pregnant and has to show the father of the child doesn't want to have any say so\nRight he doesn't have any say so and whether she has an abortion or not right\nWell she didn't have any say so whether they should just show up for adoption or whatever\nThe father does have have the father has a legal right to contest the adoption\nHe does yeah in in every adoption situation uh the the the father's consent is required\nThat he has more rights if he's married less rights if he's on married and so the the father's consent is required for an adoption scenario and so I and I think our law references that even if it's just a one night stand with reverence the biological connection that a father has there let's give him a chance to show himself\nTo be aware of the individual to raise this child so if you're if you're tracking with me on that so [noise]\nYeah so I think what you know what we need is a more more people to come forward that who have had a who maybe maybe it's a woman who was had an abortion\nRight and they now regret it we can we uh we think or the ... the father who who is uh his girlfriend or his wife has had an abortion and he didn't want that to happen just like we were we were talking about the eastern Asian example so if an elderly person in some states wants a doctor to kill them euthanize them that's illegal right\nBut if that elderly person does not give their consent to be euthanized is that Dr killed them without their consent\nThat's wrongful death in that doctor can be sued for wrongful death do you have to set up the state of the elderly person so that elderly person did not just like the child in the world as a child in the womb it's legal to kill the child\nBut for the same moral analogy we think that the abortion doctors can be sued for wrongful death\nOr right now and then we're not talking about suing mothers here nobody wants to sue\nAs I say so if if I'm if I'm the father of a child and they and the mother a boss a child if I'm saying that the the abortion doctors are going to be charged with murder why wouldn't the motive each was murdered\nRight yeah and I think we have to look at the equity of the law here low hanging fruit you got people like Gloria gray who's the owner of the Tuscaloosa abortion clinic on average Thirteen children were killed there every business day in Tuscaloosa she brings in about two point three million in revenue\nIt should be in it is in comprehensible that in Alabama we should let people profit\nFrom convince from from killing children right so that the lie of the abortion industry is that it's going to be terrible for you to carry this child for nine months that's that's not that's not a law that is true my wife just we just had our fourth maybe it is terrible to carry a child but that is not as bad as the guilt and pain and suffering that comes for the rest of your life\nPeople that go through abortion they have increased a likelihood of mental illness increase the likelihood of suicide the guilt that comes along with that that life time of regret with that is far worse than nine months of suffering physically to carry a child so what you're trying to find people to be ... and the case\nI think if somebody were in that situation we would love to talk with him was the ideal situation I mean I think the ideal situation is if somebody has a ... a man or woman so just take a minimum if a woman has had an abortion\nAnd she regrets that or she's then I think let's talk with her lips are lore is compiling a book of people with the stories abortion survivors is what we're ... we're calling it let's talk with them and so somebody that's had an abortion regrets it or a father\nWho has his child has been killed through abortion huge maybe have tried to talk the woman out of having an abortion or and and and and and now he wants to sue the abortion clinic for killing his child without his consent or the child's consent and this really I think a day in ...\nIn principle moving forward is this is the state's rights issue this ability to sue an abortion a OBGYN the ability to sue for the wrongful death of an unborn child it didn't come from the federal government\nIt came from the state government the state of Alabama has granted that right and that's where the the the right to control what children we protect and ... and can't protect it should be in the state so this if\nIf if roe v weight is going to be overturned everybody agrees it's going to that that power to protect children whatever phase of development is the state's rights issue that's where it should be right should be in the states\nInteresting we had the author and a screen play wider of guys know on yesterday\nAt such a good movie it was a powerful powerful interview that we had with her\nTrying to get it set

[noise]\nMy clients [noise]\nThat's right and we caught on cameras in the business [noise] a climber camper [noise] [noise]\nLike a rock I Am a fact [noise] kinda\nWe're still on this camera or copper climbers [noise]\n\nWhere they kept in the closet\nWell I have taken the copper climbers from a clock [noise]\nOne fire to manage or get even his name ...\n[noise] using less right [noise] I think well I'm\n[noise]\nYou know where this flood cohorts from Cleveland [noise]\nTraffickers what makes it worse they were clean [noise]\nClean copper climbers match right or do you think Cleveland is flawed Cooper when ... you're cutting in Congress\n[noise]\nOnly one reason why that is a maniac [noise] first discovered the copper climbers we're cops my coming woman\n[noise] quicker [noise]\nLet me see if I got the facts straight here [noise] cleaning woman with a clever and discover your clean power climbers kept in a closet for ... by talk the talk from Cleveland now how about it [noise]\nOne\nOther thing was that if I ever\nExpected maniac quadruple claim on who caught by clean copper climbers will get from the closet all collaborate [noise]\nJohnny\nCarson and the amazing thing about Johnny it and we talked about this before is that he was on the Tonight Show for Thirty years sixty two Ninety two or maybe a little bit longer than that\nAnd Johnny Was equal opportunity wise guy I mean I don't know if he liked dislike Ronald Reagan for example but Reagan was a regular on the show and they always had a good time there was never any ugliness whether he was talking politics or anything else with the\nThe guess here and that's what made him great and to this day I couldn't tell you what he thought about the darn thing and I kind of like it that way we have an interesting guess here in Studio\n... grubs size is with the ah it it's an anti aging boot camp it's the successful aging boot camp successful age yes this is a very critical topic\nWell to some of our staff you're on the radio station you know like rich Thomas and I think you're hoping it was ... like the gay joined us out of it yeah\nAnd if you do you need to do is successful like well we can we shouldn't be anti aging can't blow an infusion you can do a few things about it ... [laughter]\nWe're not here to talk about that but uh uh ... the aging successfully boot camp yes\nUm since you hear what's the premise ... in who's this foreign how do people get involved with\nTrust [noise] well I like to say if you're fifty five and older is the most attended bent to learn how to age of students at least fifty five should shut that they will [laughter] ah\nSo ah the premise behind it is that you've got a lot of misinformation out there about Medicaid and how you can qualify and protect drafted a people don't know where to go to figure out how to\nActually choose like a home health care provider or what to look for in assisted living facility for love one so there's just a lot of different\nWhat we did was we got a group of what I like to call aging experts who've been doing a a working I should say in this field for years now as administrators and directors and things like that of some of the local uh\nNursing homes and assisted living and things and they're going to come there'll be a panel you know uh\nThere's things about hospice like I personally thought if someone was on hospice they didn't have loaned live right but I met somebody who's been a hospice for ten years so you know things like that that will be exploring this\nIt's a demographic that's ignored at great peril I think to business as you've just gotta ride it off and I think those of you who have lived through that experience you understand what I'm Talking about it's almost as if they don't care you look at the election that they're\nVery few of them target senior groups is the one that\nAnd and that type of a behavior I remember in the ah I worked in Florida for twenty five years their level folks down [laughter] something happen in the eighties and this group was born in Tampa called the gray Panthers they organized and they said we may or may not be everybody's cup of tea\nUh for a centerfold but there's a lot of us and we have power if we look out for our own best interest as a group and they affected a lot of changes\nIn the laws down there\nI'm almost wandering election as they're they're really I\nOther than maybe a a blow away term like we're going to look after your Social Security well if you had looked after it wouldn't be worried about it now that that's true and you just don't know um\nWhat what's out there so\nI'm your mission hopefully and the one you want to accomplish and You're welcome to come back by the way thank you want to talk about veterans' issues sometimes yes we're always looking to expand our our field of experts of\nPeople have obviously been missing or give us a couple of examples where people or particular situations where you find a\nPiglet misinform yeah okay for instance ah\nFor Medicaid purposes okay\nYou know if the barber shop the beauty shop when someone has a loved one going into a nursing home or are they in rehab about to go into a nursing home the first thing they tell you is you've got to give all your stuff away okay\nAnd if you do that you will be penalized heavily by Medicaid and there's a right way and a wrong way to get on Medicaid and given all your stuff away is what I Would say is the wrong way\n... why would they ah I Would think they have a ... what's the penalty\nThe the penalty period depends on how much stuff you actually give away\nAnd there are ways you can actually get your stuff exempt and not have to give it to your adult children or to your other loved ones in order to qualify\nA because traditionally people think Medicaid's a government assistance so you have to be flat broke to be on it now there's a five year look back period which means they combed through anything you've done for the last five years and they say hey you know you gave this five hundred dollar\nA charitable donation to your church was that could have\nPaid for some health care and that could have paid for some nursing homes day so you get penalized for that so five years back and they look back five total years\nAh through everything and what really raises a red flag is anytime you gave something to someone and it was more than two hundred and Ninety nine dollars so [noise] uh you know but there's a way to plant around that to protect your assets keep your stuff you know pass your life savings on that next generation but you just got a plan and we are going to be discussing that\nAt this event but that's a huge misconception I see people in my office all the time and they say well you know we already gave the house to the sun and we already gave a\nThat this other property to this to my daughter and then you know we've cashed out this when we cashed out there\nAnd we've been using it to pay and then we gave some way to like the grandchild or something and then when they look at it they're just thinking you know I'm going in the nursing home and on for me to qualify guy get rid of my stuff and that's just not how it works so he's just really have to plan in order to protect your assets\nI Can't speak to a specific instance with that but I remember when we were helping the rolling last year and a family that lost their health insurance and then the wife got cancer\nAnd are we raise some ah some money to help them out because he had to be with her and they had no family and things you had very very brutal for them financially and a few people\nDonated by check which they deposited in their account and when they finally got the attention uh for her disability they penalize there because they had received\nGifts yep yep I was so outraged that that is\nA it just you know that that\nThey they're not only looked at the the bank records I mean okay you can maybe if you're going to claim that you have no assets fine but then\nIt's just it kinda that his income yes yes and it was just crazy so it's kind of similar to what you're describing\nIs yes you gotta like they say if you ah\nIf you don't plan you plan to fail so you've got to really you gotta really plan is more important now I feel like the never especially for veterans because it used to be if you were a veteran and suddenly you had to go into an assisted living um\nYou know you could come to an attorney like myself and actually get things done quickly and qualify very quickly but now the new rule change makes it so that the VA has a three year look back\nSo with a three year look back it's kind of similar to medicate and the fabulous back they're going to start penalizing you so you know it's just one of those things where if you don't plan ahead\nOr if you plan ahead you're great I mean there's so much that can be done and sure you can save so many assets and pass everything on um I had somebody in the office today actually who was told that there are a and the four one K. and all that was safe\nAnd it's not if someone has to go into Medicaid\nAnd they wanted to know well if I'm the one staying at home and his mom are a lot of they get a look at my IRA if my spouse has one going into the nursing home right and that's because the Medicaid rule allows them to do that you know they they take everything into consideration and everything's up for grabs so you know that's why you just have to plan ahead\n[noise] I don't know much about a Medicaid but let me ask you one question a number of years ago before I moved to Montgomery I had been in a car accident had a long\nRecovery period and I was in so much pain I really could not work and somebody said go to Social Security and apply for disability until you get back on your feet\nAnd I went through that whole advocate and I had I mean a pile of evidence okay wasn't like everyone and I'm not feeling good today so give me the money\nIt was a very tedious about four hours to fill out the whole application some of it seemed quite ... yes and the guy said well you'll probably get rejected because most people are in the first attempt but\nIf you need something in the meantime this application will make you a ... automatically eligible for Medicaid is that still true ...\nI'm not sure about Social Security and then being able to go get you know social ... building they've been able to go get Medicaid ... a lot of times they say if you qualify for one you qualify for the other [noise]\nUm you know usually what happens in a situation like that\nIs you've got someone a for instance this was a an another incident where we had a guy who worked for himself four years you know um and he went into the hospital he was in hospital for six seven months so if you're self employed all of a sudden there's no\nIncome coming right so is ... ended up in our office and what we did was you know we had to work with these nursing homes and some of these other places getting place but you have to go ahead and apply for Social Security disability SSI says the all that stuff um\nBefore you could actually be on Medicaid because we're there 'til you as you know a lot of times\nThey'll say well if you get that\nYou're automatically should get the U.S because the criteria is so close\nTo a ... so [noise] I much street taint the basic share successful aging boot camp to address transitioning to a

[laughter]\nBecause I mean this is ... it's beyond ... this is Halloween like there's no beating the song I think ... most any other big song up against this is going to lose and this is the same jak Warren Beatty [noise]\nIn some Elvis songs were fuses\nMass appeal we're talking about the pop but it's still ... ...\n... ... and ... and you got the voice over talking about\nA thousand years of fun\nThat base is very just telling me any very rhythmic with this local reminds me of James Brown always delivering the vocal very arithmetic\nNow now now that's another question [noise] do you think it's kind of unfair because we've got a thing [noise] Michael Jackson the from the time he got some Motown\nLearned from genius as his running running him and his brothers were first tool around by\nA when they first followed around the temptations that's how they got a lot of their steps down as a group when you're learning from people like that exactly there you go from that singing with Diana Ross going on tour with her\nAnd then you you get the hang around James Brown I mean he was just around genius right his whole life a whole\nLife like it's it's just I think it's possible debate and that I mean that's pretty much like okay so it comes down to thriller right now I think we've got this uh three to well wait wait you want to be starting something over don't stop to get it off sure\nI've got don't stop to you though so that's one one there we both agree on rock with you of course so we're both ... working day and night over the girl was mine we both agree of course and we both agree on thriller\nYeah you you got to admit it's in the ... but these albums\nAre neck and neck and this is the thing you wouldn't have you just said what's better off ... off the wall or thriller\nEverybody is probably going to go with thriller because it ranks hiring greatest albums list it sold more copies and there's no arguing these things it's more iconic in the culture but real hard to ah it's real hard to say that\nThriller is beating off the wall says point well in ...\nWell I'm going to put I'm going to put it if you like this\nThriller thriller was\nWhy we say commercial what I mean by the difference between the two off the wall was more of Michael coming out as an artist okay I'm Michael yet but this type of music I like this is the way I like to sing\nThriller was more of okay I've been out for a minute now I Know how I'm going to get the same producers but we're going to we've had more time together and it it's kind of like being a white belts\nNo and they they took it to another level and I think if you go just by so and you know folks are only halfway through the show oh and a half way through these albums that I gotta feeling thrillers about to go for the the knockout\nPunch when it comes to which one is going to head to head which one is better album oh no oh no off the wall might surprise you know we'll see we'll see but uh we get a break here before we do that\nUntil folks about who makes shows like this possible offering anybody any banter with the goods in group he wants to be your buyers aged now what does that mean\nWhat what does that mean that means just like Michael Jackson bought the Beatles cattle out he wants to help you buy properties around ... exactly\nAnd by that dream home that home for that growing family but what exactly does it mean when Eddie Baker was it goes in group says I Want to be your buyers a jet\nI mean why do you care he's a buyer's Asian ... isn't just a real estate agent no a buyer's agent is that it's helping you the buyer\n... exactly exactly and you have to you you have to bring that into effect to the times the times uh 'cause thriller was what Nineteen eighty two\nSo you had cleaner sympathizers you had newer sounds that you could work with and you can hear pieces of it in off the wall in Seventy nine some of the synthesizer that time but it's still sounded old is still sounded a little more\nFun or will it sounds like you're leaning more towards off the wall the videos that you have to appreciate the music not just the visuals and the\nYeah you know I Would have to say I appreciate you use it because I understand that I saw what the video effect had to do on you\nThe thriller the title song from thriller was an actual movie because I was young enough to remember when that ... ... it was the whole night event\nAnd it was it's really the only music really did come together and MTV actually played music videos exactly whereas in Seventy nine and it just wasn't happening like it was still not happening now well I don't really play music videos that's that's true it's kind of a lot of that are and it really is sad but will appreciate the call man\nThanks appreciate bigger it kind of ... industry towards off the wall and you know what\nReally didn't think about that yeah that\nThat the fact that the media and stuff like that you played it and it\n... along the way of tracking\nSix of us it takes like one two three four five six\n... six on off the wall as friends and I can't sing it I Can't sing ... cold\nAgainst Billie Jean [noise] now don't tell me that Billie Jean is great just because the visuals\nMotown twenty five yeah I can say that 'cause I was there when he did the moon walk and the next day in my classroom everybody was trying our teacher was trying to do the ...\nThe moon walk that's the I ... it it's a little hole performer at its best but also just the music gene is better than girlfriend though I Love girlfriend it's a sweet interesting pop song yeah yeah but you know Paul McCartney song yeah you have to assume that ... wrote that\nThis guy brought out a suitcase\nDidn't do nothing just brought out a suitcase and for two minutes people were just they knew something about that\nNow that's that's how like when Michael was that famous an over the top famous like he's that over the where you can come out and he just stands there like he did Super Bowl and lets her\nLike they were the crowd kind of the gums when they first see them they go nuts\nAnd then he's like that goes down a little bit but he knows if he just keeps standard there not move and they'll come up again it's like just because they're expected to rise up again like you just make some wanted eve teasing the audience it's just intense and man that base be on the first two seconds of that and it's like man it's ...\nI'm Sorry girlfriend I'm Sorry Paul McCartney\nMe too me too because they're going to the glove itself is in the rock and Roll Hall of fame you can't rebuild Jean ... and it's such a ... down dirty so ... oh you were of that one micro right that well I think Michael ... Michael I'm not right to\nKnow Mike or about what we that's that's a dirty so yeah okay\nWell let's let's set up the next match ups and we'll go to Clark here on the line if you want to join the conversation if you think we're out of our mind still similar to nine to two a again the number two seven to nine two to eight\nOr ... uh comparing it to be ... comparing and contrasting the thriller album against\nOff the wall so number seven okay we've got she's out of my life off off the wall\nHuman nature from thrilling [noise] both both really good songs\nThat's a tough one but no I'll let you know smell it before I say anything we can bring Clark and Clark what's up\nHey how are you\nOh I'm I'm doing well or are you okay do you always speaking the tone of voice\nI just ... I was calling in about oh I'll seriously I was calling about human nature oh wow I'm as well how does that off up through\nIt's out of my life yeah that that's befallen his best song ever that that's up there with like pet sounds I mean that is it is an incredible song\nIt is good so that book that fall subtly it is that right yeah\nYeah it's unbelievable I listen I'm not that was one thing I Will come on such a thing was on the Michael ... most of the songs or was was that all published out of the house\nI'm now I'm looking at it now like I'm off the wall he wrote don't stop doing good enough he wrote working day night he wrote get on the floor he ... and that's it on and off the thriller album he wrote want to be starting something here at the girl was mine with the gardening but he's the\n... who ... thriller\nOr that's Tim Burton rod rod with in Britain but Michael did write beat it Michael wrote Billie Jean\nYeah Clinton ... a lot of\nQuincy ... he didn't Quincy isn't credited as\nThe writer like lyrical Ryder I'm much right\nYou know he ... he's a producer on every song yeah yeah he ... he handles musical arrangements\nFor the most part\nYeah I'm not a big a lot of big Michael Jackson's fan but I Will tell you that a thriller and uh you know human nature is an amazing salt\nReally as oh it is it's a unique sounding song too from Michael\nAll it absolutely is absolutely as I Do you do it a great job is always a I Know it's a long time to to keep trying it in their body ... ... talk to you Bye bye yeah\nThat's I'm Glad he call in because it was that what you're going to say yeah I I have to give it to human nature make is that like I said that false settled he hits in the middle of that song yeah and how many times it's been ... done like that\nThat song has been on so many remakes is from as WVU to Chris Brown recently did a song called a ... which uses the same musical arrangement from that song\nAnd it's such a ... for like a pretty funky record at all the rock record like it is a truce sweet pop song yes it is ...\n... no no no\nI'm In it it's so like it's ... it's very very good okay so human nature wins there and now we go to number eight against number eight to let's set this up here and as we're setting up let's go back to the phones to seven to nine situated who's is you're on the air\nThis will again [laughter] you okay we'll come back we'll\nOkay All right John driving in one more time cut them in and out All right what's what's the step here okay we're now setting up\nPeople IT pretty young thing off thriller\nAgainst I Can't help it off off the wall\nI got to be lacking [noise] thank you all are going with people I see yeah OK\nOkay it makes sense huh let's see how it is [laughter] I see how it is I mean because that that expression is still used by older guys today trying to talk to younger women yeah it is\n[laughter] I Can't argue against that I Can't argue that the expressions still place I mean but if you actually say that to a girl does it actually play\n... it depends on how I'm like no no no wait a minute limit it depends on how are you saying okay how does 'cause how the way you said you know just imagine I'm a I'm a lady out and it was a girlfriend\nI was ... little ...\nLet me before we get away from me you create a no no come on come on out in the dead [laughter] [laughter] no I think it could work\nThen the fact that young kids even today know what that expression is I think it's withstood the tests\nSo I'll give it that I'm just saying that you know [noise]\nNow than\n\nThat is the thing with Michael so if you don't have to even sing and it just seemed to hook\nYou can do can lose too good for\nThat is good\nI I the I think about [noise]\nWell go ahead well\nSorry outlook I Know we're we're going head to head with the album but\nBecause you said Paul McCartney awhile ago maybe think about another song and act on musical lock on uh the one with Mick Jagger state of shock yeah about it okay to think about it gotcha gotcha that's a good one it is good\n... I don't know what that will but not out well no I don't\nI'm not saying we will do the research and get a gun never never never know what the next battle my Carney did just come out with a new album now coming out with new music yeah that's amazing and the ... still alive they got kids at Richard ...\nGo back go back and look up state of shock\nI Will will do will take care man thanks for the call see OK yellow ... of course of course and that was funky that's why I played a little bit of it but I think people have forgotten how good I Can't help it is so ... got to give people a tape [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Coosada", "day": "23"}
