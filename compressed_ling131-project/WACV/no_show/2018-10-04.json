strange stuff around the trailer court right yeah I remember I told you about that get left or curtains on from sometimes\nOften she's doubled showing it really [noise]\n\nSecret studios in a tree house complete with cable TV and that you're cruising with the little bubbles in his health and will show I'm rusty and for the next thirty minutes you're going to hear some good news about your money\nNow here's your host the ... counts of financial victory\nBaker who's always got to know\nWhat the man who convinced when I was gonna quit selling fried chicken and go into the candy business it's David iron is yes we went into the candy business and he said David days twenty two\nAnd I said why is that he said because now I Can't walk on with my shoe\n[laughter] I guess well sticks like glue that yeah yeah well yeah and you know it'd be bad\nTo have all that fried chicken and the ... get the harder it is now because the ledge twenty two yeah well and you know we we did come up with a with a a a way to explain a catch twenty two is like when you just starting out\nAnd you go down here to company X Y Z and you want a job and they look you over so well you're fine looking you know ma'am but we just can't hire you because you got no experience and you're twenty two years old uh-huh and then they say you say well how ... getting experience if I don't have a job\nThat I didn't catch twenty two and of course there was a there was a movie yeah and uh the the the whole thing in in that movie he was trying to get out of a\n... billion in the army oh it was a he was out on they they they weren't in a combat zone they were out on this island near every year but he didn't want to show up to the to to get shot at so I don't think that I'm going to be crazy\nYeah what do you run into catch twenty two every day there's always a cat here when I turn on red you know that kind of always a catch twenty two you know a\nCatch twenty two definition is ... a dilemma are difficult circumstance\nMutually conflicting are dependent can dish recall a trap you thought the trap why can't get out because maybe your lover too much baby I guess so yeah so\nOh that's another story [laughter] another show thank you very much part of part wherever so catch twenty two\nAh it's ... it's a paradox because you got contradictory things going on and supposedly the term was coined by Joseph Heller H. E. L. L. E. R. ... who used it as Nineteen sixty one novel catch twenty two\nAh\nAn example and I'm reading is ... is how am I supposed to gain experience to fight and you just said yeah a good job of armed conflict turned them but I have any\nQuestion how do you get it how do you get out of your dilemma so to speak and there's a lot of people that are in dilemmas out there mhm during catch twenty two years they they work\nThey don't say they don't save because do one helps them save\nA they don't say because they married to an unsafe or they don't save cause they don't have enough left over to say ... they don't say because they had to put the children first they don't save because this that whatever something always in the way they don't save\nBut the catch twenty two is is if you don't save who's going to take care of you age twenty two\nThat's right because of the time I come in when there's nobody left to take care of catch twenty two and you\nYou won't you won't have something to leave when you go but if you know if there's nobody there to take\nCare of you know the government gets your money and yet nothing left to leave\nCatch twenty two exactly here's another catch twenty two now how many twenty two year olds are going to be interested when you get old in saving you catch twenty two mhm they don't want to work for you and you can't blame them\nRestaurant where we treat you like family excuse me can I get a little more ... place I'll get it yourself on business say okay well maybe it's like the math and family I don't know\nBut here's David iron is [noise]\nThank you rusty a free shake that so much oh yeah\nYou always make me feel real good glad to do it you know and and speaking of a real good and fun we're going to do something pretty fun here pretty soon this we are all understand we're going to be talking about it on the ah the website and Facebook page and it's just going to be big do and so we want to talk about it in an hour just\nTell you well you know a\nWe'll we'll just say this because it's going to be an annual event any way or we're going to have a annual Christmas Party probably in here and so just be looking on our Web sites\nAre and uh for those dates mhm and and where it's going to be because they will be an annual thing that we will do this\nAnd and you will everybody will have on like\nAnd funding a little elf hats and\nYou know will be given a candy canes ... Christmas tree mia yeah we'll we'll we'll we'll have a lot of fun and we and we're going to bring some people\nAre in that people thought were not here anymore in the [noise] and we're going to have some fun with him\nAt this going to be something to see so stay tuned as they say they too and uh one one real quick thing I just want to mention to seven nine seven four three wars we mentioned the number a lot because we want you to call\n'em now somebody that I talked to\nActually calls you and you're working something with them now by\nAnd are odd I'll tell I'll tell a lot of folks that I that I Know that uh I Know David and if I got Doctorow four one K. laying around in there or do it well you you don't do anything call David delivered and tell you what the best thing to do would be\nAnd um you know it's as simple as that just to take you take this thing you can't see it but this one right here and you are\nWell known not that thank you take this finger and you just start punching you push to seven nine seven four three one and I think I think that goes right to uh to your answering absolutely right\nAnd you have to end you check it I'll check it frequently and All right back so you have to seven nine seven four three want plus I get a nickle for every time he calls\nWhenever we do have events they will be on the answering machine too there you go yeah so if you're if you're inquisitive about what event we're going to have and what ever go to the website or go to the answering machine and or should I call my number and you will get information\nAs to what is planning that dates and things like seven or seven for three one\nSo we're talking about catch twenty two mhm that's like um you're in a building and its own fire\nGet down the stairs is buildings on fire over a five or six floors firemen are down there that they go find a catchy in ... he looked down and you see it split down the middle ... so no matter what you do you go and get bombed up a little bit\nHere in the cage twenty year and a catch twenty two what to do what to do or if you can literally you can fly\nIs you might have been avoided a lot of a catch twenty two if you're prepared\nFry a you won't be in the catch twenty two you can't get out of all your catch twenty two not not ever said that you could ask a catch twenty two and itself as a ... catch ... if that's the sub a sub article cash ... catch twenty two twenty to twenty two ah\nAh one of those dimensional things ... but\nSo the thing is you can always pre planned for things that could hit you if you know that they could hit you\nIn the probabilities of I'll give you an example mhm what's the probability that you will need to have a retirement plan oh I Would say a hundred percent\nOkay what's the probability that you need a long term care plan of that but I Would go on and say pretty close to a hundred percent if not a hundred percent in a family it's Seventy percent chance why individuals forty percent of\nAll what's the chances that your house would burn down it fifty when no\nOne to two percent although I was talking to an insurance guy the other day and I said if they say it's actually six percent but I don't know two percent or six percent not near as much as the Saturday or a hundred percent chance what's\nThe chances that you will leave this world someday oh a unless you know something a hundred percent there you go these are things that would make sense for you not to leave your family or you can catch twenty two don't you think I think so\nSo to think that you're going to be able to avoid these catch twenty two situations these paradoxes ... that you can't get out of those words\nThis is going to hurt over here and as well I'll give you that example you have you ever been to the dentist\nYes go quite frequently catch twenty two year you got a real bad real bad to think yeah and he said this going to hurt to get this thing out of here\nBut when I get it out it won't hurt anymore it'll could hurt adequate hurt but is going to be extreme pain\nSo you've heard of that term bite the bullet uh-huh and you go ahead and let him pull it out Russ how broke for two hours bite the bullet and [laughter] you shouldn't have been no SARS oh\nShould you be bite the bullet right now for the catch twenty two that's coming that huge headache the big to think it's going to come in the future if you didn't get ready for\nLong term care if you didn't get ready for retirement if you didn't get ready for your hair couldn't let me cut your hair to get cut and you've got to long hair and then\nThere you go well you know and it's something we had mentioned in a while was that the grasshopper and the ant oh I remember that you have to\nOld grasshoppers after playing in June tobacco and not do and not just sitting around watching everybody else over there's that little an aunt just work in a way is our number is summertime and everybody's going fishing and and having a good time but this little lion he's put in a way for the winter he's he's looking out for the future\nHe's looking for his vote it's of hedge twenty two\nAnd the next thing you know winters here the grasshoppers out in the cold ain't got no groceries ain't got no place to stay in the aunt is all in his little house over there and he's he's taken care of he's he's he's got stuff loaded up well he looks out and Harris Poll\nIt was just like for the sake of argument that he did help him out but the thing is when it got summer again the grasshoppers out there playing he's not putting up here for the winter or as you say more of a story or some folks never learn\nFrom people just don't get it and some people just get it in the ... and [laughter]\nThat would be there for about ... ah that you're talking about [laughter] yeah [laughter] and we saw that on ... [laughter]\nYou know what you [laughter] you know what I call the product Donald just than Jamaican don't you why is that a ... [laughter]\nIf you don't want to\nGet poked in you know yeah yeah you know joke either yeah you don't want to get poked in broken now break your note or your yogurt [laughter] no joke [laughter]\nThat's all folks [laughter] you need to call David or has he will show you how to be a good aunt and if you're a grasshopper he could teach you what you need to do so you don't have to depend on cars that I might get you know aggravated and just\nCut you off you know I've seen that\nI've seen it where people come in and talk to me as I say I say are you going to get a hair it's one of the questions we ask 'cause you know how much money guy how much you're going to make and what she plans ... are you going to get in here and I've had people say yeah I've got this and I'm the only nephew\nI'm the only needs and this this ... this rich uncle is going to leave me\nBob Bob ball so\nYour time huh mhm rich and rich uncle and they come and they say a David I Am so I'm so sad what happened I did not know this but rich uncle rich\nAnd they had another play of the ... will I took it\nWas they gave it to someone else I Believe this or not one came in and said that their grandmother was so mad if their mother\nBack the money that they were going to use for their college education they give to an orphanage instead sending the orphans to college they sent some body they didn't even know\nThe college and let go of their own blood ... must have been may they were the point I'm trying to make as you can always get the catch twenty two ... don't\nDon't be counting your legs before they hatch and don't be counting somebody else's eggs because you don't even know if they're going to happen for you\nBut not be bad eggs ... you've got to have your own nest egg you get to have your own is full of eggs in you can't be let them fall down on the ground\nUh the\nThe fact that President Trump comes out yesterday and starts talking about it a and says look this could be your father your brother's son she's getting excoriated and the media or they're saying he he's attacking a victim how did you take it\n[noise] well I agree with the president a hundred percent but you know the war on women law has been perpetrated by the Democrats in this case\nYou know a doctor for one of the you know I don't know the woman but she wanted this to be kept confidential and the Democrats exposed that they leaked it and they expose it intentionally for their own purpose\nBut this is part of a bigger attempt by the Democrat to take this to a new level I mean the paid activists that are around right now or my wife and I were physically accosted at a public airport on Monday This week because of this these people were paid by the center of public democracy\nOr they get money from the open society foundation which is George Soros who is putting to listen to this more than thirty two billion billion dollars into this effort over the last couple years this is a bigger issue and it's not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week\nNow and I think ah you're exactly right I think it's time for conservatives to stop playing defense\nAbsolutely everyone on their heels all the time like Jeff Flake later this hour in an elevator and then you get rid of the ladies are yelling at me it turns out the woman is a co executive director of of this or is funded group as he said Center for democracy and I think it's time to turn the tables were okay sunshine on you who are you people\nWho are working for this organization you are carrying on and I think you can make the argument senator that uh\nAnd maybe a good lawyer plaintiff lawyer could do this or just go to good litigation attorney could do this this is kind of a it's a Rico deal like these groups are working together to deny other people their rights to movement free movement which is guaranteed under our constitution free association or they're ... they're\nActing in a way to deprive others I I Would say of there\nAre inherent civil rights and I totally agree meant to intimidate\nI totally agree but listen to what the senators are doing to incite the crazies in this effort this is senator Cory Booker you just had him on their here's another one\nThis is Corey Booker please get up in the face of some congresspeople representative Maxine Waters they're not going to be able to go to a restaurant go to a gas station go to shop at a department store\nTheir absolute set up an absolutely harass them\nNancy Pelosi I don't know why they aren't uprising all over the country I mean it goes on tell me again while we shouldn't confront Republicans where they eat where they sleep where they work until they stop being complicit\nDo anything you know to should serve to wake us up you're exactly right Democrats had been playing off is for the last hundred years it's time for Republicans to stop being a minority party and wrote and and grow and grow up and say you don't have to grow up and become a you know stop playing defense is is this is the time right now\nA senator for do ah there's so much a\nIt's happening a which is positive or in this administration the news has been under a mitten ling\n... only negative uh because ... that's just one of the media are they're not going to that I mean we've had this NAFTA deal pass okay or your basement and does she has to pass the Senate\nEveryone said this couldn't happen they said Trump was a big ... of Obama ridiculed I'm going to maybe the way this magical hours I'm going to renegotiate all these deals while you know didn't took actually work to do this like Nineteen months of work\nI and and you know you don't hear nothing on this huge alone milestone for this administration\nIt's huge but it's part of a as part of what's going on this this economy is growing at twice the rate it did under President Obama we have a new free trade agreement with South Korea were about how wall with Mexico and Canada Europe is talking about zero terrorists we have China paying stepping up and paying attention to us now we have a nuclear\nConversation going on with North Korea to to end up in the ... of North Korea\nThis poses agendas working at all we talk about is what the Democrats want us to talk about that is what you're saying is that we need to be on the op is talking about what's working in this agenda before we get into these elections in a few weeks\nI I can tell you the senator no one's going to want to try to stop me moving in a public street or try to harassment or restaurant okay\nThis is a new I tolerate that anyone in my family and my kids\nThey they've been they've been it'd be really ready because this is ... I'm not intimidated by some rich kid who lives at home with his parents and and it's free time you know jumps on the move on dot org website to get his marching orders okay like go home to rich parents and and and who pay for your three square meals a day and you're you're\nYou know your your activism on the side of it I just it just doesn't impress me I call these people right after their faces\nLaw that's what we're going to be ... this week and it starts right here in the United States Senate people who are supporting this\nActively encouraging and signing it we have a state representative that actually was involved in our altercation on Monday a state representative from Arizona okay of all places here in Washington these are not genuine people who are ... out\nOf Dr Ford or anything else these are paid activists this is a George Soros conspiracy and it's time we wake up expose them and stand up and fight for our country because that's what's at stake here\nDo you think we have enough Republican money bags types\nTo counter the effort is dire and sorrows because they're just pumping tens of millions of dollars and build or into voter registration and two are educating people in these training sessions on how to approach new voters\nUh this is you know they're going to the the new a Puerto Rican voters and in Florida\nAnd and land on line on them like oh Trump aides you and you had to throw the Republicans out and Georgia and you see this\nTight governor's race which is really disturbing to Stacey Abrams ... lost weight or Georgia could elect a left wing Stacey Abrams to meet governor great state of Georgia\nThis is what you were saying earlier one of the one of the good byproducts of this is I think it's a way can the Republican base was passed that particularly in Georgia maybe this year but I'll tell you this um that raising George has drawn thirty million dollars from um [noise] uh Mike Bloomberg and ...\nPastors and New York donors are trying to sneak into Georgia still that governor's race because they believe that's the way to the presidency and twenty twenty to get those electoral votes down there and it's just not going to happen we're not going to let that happen Laura\nI'm David Perdue a hearing the learning them show a Jeff Flake yesterday seemed to kind of shift the goalposts a little on Kavanaugh or maybe it was just commenting on his overall demeanor with the committee let's listen\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the of the remarks uh the initial a defense to judge Kavanaugh gave ... was something I Hope that I Would sound that ... if I were\nIf I felt that I was unjustly it'll maligned\nBut then it went on and the interaction with the members were sharp and partisan and the concerns me\nA year reaction was concerning to you Kevin ... says all the ...\nFloor he did exactly what I Would have expected him to do he was in ... and he should have been listening to what these guys are saying Chris Coons says if judge Kavanaugh seeking a lifetime appointment this Marine Corps\nAnd who I think now bears the bears the burden of this proving these allegations that presumption of innocence has been a trashed in this whole process is not convenient for the Democrat I mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again calls him evil\nOr the other one said a Yale alum said people will die\nI mean the vernacular here has risen to a level that we haven't seen in decades Laura and it's dangerous Republicans had better not be asleep at this because these people are now mobilized they're funded and quite frankly this is just this the tip of the spear of what their ... their Amman activity I actually\nA Center for new in Georgia is going back briefly to this very tight governor's race\nUh what is your sense what are the people need to know I'm again this was this poll by landmark pretty decent polling outfit a likely voters hum and it was basically a forty five forty five dead heat or the governorship is very important for so many reasons the state of Georgia\nA and the growth economic growth and George has been very strong ah but what could a left wing governor due to that growth\nWell here's what they what she's saying she wants a single payer and she wants all these give away programs that would cause a state tax has to be tripled this is the most extreme liberal progressive candidate that Georgia has ever had and she's getting funded by a all these outside donors not donors in Georgia by the way\nAnd so what's happening is all of this conversation about war women everything else is conducive to Georgia right and it was rated the best state in the country and what to do business and she wants to tear that down\nWe have a great Republican candidate Brian Kemp is going to make a great governor and Republican so they get the vote out we will win that election\nI think that the people of Georgia maybe they've gotten a little a little bit of an awakened awakening during the entire cabinet ideal I think ... should make this a huge issue down there and push and push this uh this Stacey Stacey Abrams enough just come out on the cabinet thing\nOf it I Would push a right to the wall and on nothing I mean it in a figurative way not literal way so don't start talking about and he didn't say anything anymore and that everyone in every little word you say like slice and dice buddies left wing groups again funded by George Soros hateful little people in their basements\nGreat training materials in books lively discussions and plenty of handouts was

more cooperation they couldn't find it after all this and after all the interviews I've done that they've they've scoured the country the Yale alumni directory the the prep school at Georgetown Prep alumni directory for anyone\nWho could be a corroborating witness to this alleged attack couldn't find it\nNo matter how they try they couldn't find it so now it's you know this is game day now this is where the rubber meets the road\nAnd there are exposed for what they are by the way a more information about ah Christine Blasey Ford's friend in Delaware a career FBI agent unlikely was with her during the accusation letter construction um this letter was not redacted\nFord lived with Monica McLean\n'em and during that time her boyfriend said it was my understanding that McLean was interviewing for a job within the FBI and the rest of us attorney's office I witnessed Dr Ford help McLean prepare for the polygraph as I told you before explaining detail what to expect in a polygraph\nAnd how polygraph worked and help McLean become familiar with less and less nervous about the exam\nDr Ford was able to help because of her background in psychology\n[noise] um and he goes on how we flew around the Hawaiian Islands together uh and\nHe ended the relationship once she discovered that Ford was unfaithful while living in why\nI'm\n... Ford was continuing to charge on their credit card\nOr after they broke up well it's not that big a deal when confronted Dr ...

All right uh we have more information more news will get to all your calls coming up congressman Andy Harris was a victim of the left intimidation campaign yesterday we'll talk about what happened when we come back\nOr or\n\n\nOf nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule I just wanted to keep you up\nGetting down to the nature every month maybe sometimes twice a month from my friend who had a MRI done cats can ah last week a very good friend of ours could a teaching okay told me two years ago today and they got one and it's like\nI'm so happy for down for nature [laughter] because anything else we're just not doing it\nWithout being harassed salute\nA you know just it just shouldn't be just shouldn't be allowed and again it it that's not how civil discourse occurs in this country are you couldn't you couldn't agree or disagree with with with what ice does the fact is there a legitimate law enforcement agency they don't like it\nThey'll try to you know it's time to change the law obviously that's what some of these individual doing by attempting to elect people who said\nOr they're going to abolish ice I disagree with that but again we can have a public discussion but you don't have to get physical you don't have to threaten someone and again it it it uh it's sad when you know when when a member of Congress goes out and says uh this is the way you should protest is you know getting people's faces\nConfront them or it's not civil it's not right it's not the way I was raised and I guess some people are just raised differently in terms of what they think is acceptable in in a in a free country\nA congressman Harris an ear thoughts on the overall political climate in America and they sit in the house of representatives been given where this Kavanaugh's confirmation saga has gone with unsubstantiated allegations most all of them\nThose people are finally coming out and saying whoa I Know this person says it helps to help someone take a polygraph wants clearly lied under oath if that's the case is a firsthand witness a visceral the whole Bo\nUm and it seems to me that we have a lot of people with a lot of money who are unhappy that Donald Trump became president\nAnd by any means necessary they will attempt to derail his agenda but not with substance with again these types of stunts\nOh oh absolutely Laura ... in the media is white front and center on this\nI'll tell you uh you know I was a physician and I watched the testimony and my comment was it was pretty clear that Dr Ford is a troubled person and I think anybody who watched the testimony a comes up to that conclusion and she admitted that she has had psychological issues\nI said that in a in a in a interview and I was accused of saying I said that she couldn't be trusted now I didn't say that\nBut that's the that's what the media water to portray they have an agenda and and that's that's what's so different now than for Thirty years ago the genders so obvious and so a parrot\nOr for many many members of the media is president thank goodness is speaking out against it uh you know calling calling it on its face and ah that had that had to be done and of course he gets criticized when he goes out to\nA congressman Harris thank you so much for that update you're listening to Laura Ingraham show at five five forty Laura we'll get to all your calls and\nI'm more information on this ah Monica McLean are here we go she was a friend of she has a friend of a Ford's a so Ford was in her hope is beach Delaware on July twenty six twenty ten\nAnd her lifelong friend Monica Monica McClain who worked as an attorney or for a pill by which is I'm In the day or Jay and FBI and a robust beach Delaware\nBoth of them are there at the same time that she wrote her a letter to Dianne Feinstein a Ford and ... McLean her best friend or the best friend she actually coached on lie detector testing or together for the four days leading up to the actual writing a letter from the twenty sixth of the thirtieth\nIt would appear this is a conservative a tree house they would appear that Ford was with McLean again the retired FBI agent and former former New York field office folks person at the time she wrote a letter to Feinstein\nThat would certainly begin to explain quite a bit about who exactly was handling ms forward and how there would be an intentional effort from a subject matter expert\nOn how to best position they attack against Kavanaugh\nWho better described the Internet history and know what process scenes and people to enlist in such preparatory work than a retired lawyer who were deeply inside the FBI a lot of people are saying deep state was involved and all this not only did ms McLean possess a particular set of skills too says system is forward\nBut ms McLean would also have a network of de OJ an FBI resources to assist in this endeavor\nA former friendly FBI agent to do the polygraph a network of politically motivated allies\nDoes the appearance of FBI insider and deputy FBI Director uh to Andrew Andrew McCabe Michael Brown which began now to make more sense\nI think about it I remember the lawyer she ultimately got with brown which\nBrown which was as anti McCain lawyer Andy McCabe former deputy director the FBI\nAnd we know that\nAbe before an advocate the um the science gives me before they he decided to ask for that extra week and that's that doesn't really bother me because they want to know what you can get done in a week an FBI background\nBut this FBI connection with the woman she was now reportedly within ... beach it's fascinating\nSo again if you examine whether she misled the committee put this country through a nightmare you need all her text messages all her emails all of those that have been deleted which are recoverable and that it\nFor ... McLean anyone who is ... it was talking to her at the time including anyone from Feinstein's office all of that needs to be out\nAll of it do you agree with me that you cannot allow people to get away from the get away with us excuse me\nTeam thing with Julie sweat neck if your cars submitting statements to the Senate Judiciary committee that are false knowingly false you should be prosecuted for that I don't care how long it takes I Would prosecute for that\n... and I bet that\nText messaging trail to Christine Ford tells a fascinating story about what really went down\nAnd I'd subpoena that therapist if the therapist even exists subpoena that therapist they look there is no patient a doctor privilege here apparently she was releasing notes and showing them to at least showing to the Washington Post she references them in her testimony gone no privilege\nBut a lot to uncover here so they want to go through other Brett Kavanaugh to use the word drunk in a handwritten note to friends or whether\nHe threw ice and Nineteen eighty five I'm not in July what happened do you what would you be curious to know that I Would I Want to know if a former FBI agent\nOr who has an enormous amount of institutional knowledge about how to scrub Internet history and other people in the FBI who would know how to do that Dr Ford knew how to do that on her own someone helped turned this process eight five five forty Laura stay there your reaction up next\n[laughter] God\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home go to the hill today [laughter]\nPlease up in the free from Congress people\nIn the left is going completely crazy\nThe Laura Ingraham show [noise]\nUm Jerry foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments that Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty it's called ... and here's how it works\nWith Rachel you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part of rates go down you get the lower rate was ratio we really have you covered\nHere are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now Jamie power his rank Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage rich nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing ratio\nAnother way we can save your money on your mortgage calls to the eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com is Iraq and words date in comparison to deter records racial group only violence or anything\nI'll be paid and wants to be thirty thirty additional conditions dark switches may apply\nNoon scenery we believe in and grab a vacation so election of our thing that you're salads and sandwiches are always ready in our grabbing go cooler\nWith Jay salad or die\nGround can slice made from scratch we take our\nAnd you don't have to just run and grab and\nWrite lines hectic dinner you'll never have to compromise for convenience Daschle undergrad\nExtraordinary like the black and blue salad loaded\nChicken salad on ... or in a container for the whole family\nAt New York's ...\nNow and knew the express market with freshly prepared\nGoodness meals to go grab and go proteins housemates office you'll be the hero at your next dinner\nSunday is twelve thirty to for thirty\nYears before we market of anti almost seem to have more information about ... will come and go back to these books we Mark I'm in the mall for twenty five coliseum boulevard\nOil\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center W.

I Love your idea\nI Love the idea of a wellness center I Love the idea that you're helping people but here's a traditionally encourage people to do because you don't currently have a yoga studio and you don't have the idea of validated\nI Want to challenge you to start a little bit smaller and a little sooner so I'll give you an example\nWhere is there a wellness center community center yoga studio ... studio somewhere where you could start your business sublease third base in off hours builds your brand build the demand you have no risk no overhead no upfront costs\nAnd you're able to validate your idea until the business justify you getting your own space beat out a duplex that you live above or\nYour own stand on space I'll give an example there are a lot of churches that will operate when they're getting started out like elementary schools the elementary school right next door household they don't have to go on Sundays so they rented out to a church that use it on Sunday\nAnd it's just a great deal to win when it's additional revenue for the school the church has a place to go without having to afford a whole building\nSeven days a week when they can't justify it and I've seen a lot of businesses do this so I don't think your ideas a bad idea I Would just challenge you to start smaller in sooner on a lower risk level lower cost level and validate your idea\nAnd build those relationships build your brand in your demand get that going and then\nWhen you're ready to have your own studio it's the next logical step it doesn't feel like a terrifyingly so you definitely look into laws and regulations for liability but also when you think about your space before you make the big commitment [noise]\nPatricia are you a lot of phone are you working full time right now\nAnd that was the question I I work fulltime and I think I'm going to Iran and I'm planning on also going back to back this year and that way I'm making more money but it will help them find the businesses let out\nToo well of course and you can I just wanted to know that fact be knows this this ... piece of information please beautifully knew what you're saying\nShe's going to have to do this on the side anyway she's not in a position to open up anything I don't think you were trying to go right on open it um I I just want to see you maybe do a little bit of yoga for some people maybe two or three moms when anything if you can get a small group of men pay you\nBecause it's everything you just said but it allows you to tip toe into it uh\nMore money I Love that too is going to lower to cash flow have more cash piled on when it's time to to operate so I mean you nailed it there I I just think ... you know don't rush into\nThe well and the other thing I Want to call out for anyone listening right now that has a service based business and like a yoga studio you have a tendency to think that the studio is the business\nIt's not it's you know it's a way you can go anywhere you can go to people's houses you can go to the park outside their calming and paying for you so don't feel like you have\nTo have a location before you can start your business because you are the business so you can start tomorrow but to get out of your living room if you want to learn and down the street and by the way\nYou should go ahead totally yeah don't wait for the studio studio is not the business you are the business point people don't care I Know they don't ... enjoy it to come in for you they're not coming for the building\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight to five five two to five ...

percent of them lost even more money by taking time off work and\nNine hundred thousand victims took out pain loans\nStop as a freaking nightmare\nSo they're different companies OK I'm here he had two of them are kind of actually my own project I work on out here in Minnesota the other one is there a company I used to work four years ago that you contract court for perfect I mean they don't have that yeah\nThe reason I'm asking is because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part\nTo validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can run this whole thing without having a boss that kind of back me and you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited in Haiti because you're just going to do more of what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken that\nYou've got this light at the end the tunnel when you're going to start ... family household income in other ways through your husband but in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand the client the relationship even just taking people to coffee starting together interests\nOf other independent projects you could run on your own that could run through this new architecture firm that you're going to run as an independent person you're building it up and of course it will be crazy for a season because you're getting more and more demand but then\nWhen you decide to leave your full time job in the next logical step where the business can support you the income is they are of course that's only going to help and your husband had income so you're all ready I Would say twenty to thirty percent down the path of doing this you're not starting from scratch or not like\nI have full time job and I want to do this totally different thing how do I started out\nYou're already doing it you already have clients you're working with I just want you to do more of that and then the next few months as you build that up that will start to ramp up as her husband's income comes in and it looks like first dear you probably should be able to comfortably\nLeisure Labor Day job yeah and it comes down to a form of the you gotta work days baby steps ... babies to fund the dream so when you put enough money aside plus decide businesses there\nAnd then that's how you get to that number where you can step aside into Christie's point does not have to be ... jump right that should be a nice move and it just takes a little bit of time and patience but the lights on her way\nThe light at the end of the tunnels an important point can cause so many people still like how cannot sustain this well you're not till January then when you that light of the total you know this is the first season them to put my head down for a season them and had the rewards it's worth it things are All right let's go to ray real quick in Orlando, Florida ... how can we help\n[noise] hey how you doing guys I'm OK

I mean I'm making a hundred thousand a hundred and ten thousand a year somewhere in there they are not having you know ... months\nNot any zero a month or during the winter in Colorado there's um a month later slower than others where you know making the making the budget would be tight tighter in my ... I'm\nNot I don't I don't I never expand the baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly vulnerable and I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nYou really need to stop and think about what you just said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have a zero money I'll go along with that part\nBut I don't think that's what's really happening you might get eight thousand dollars a month average so I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so anyway set some aside but we're not going to call in an emergency fund and we're not going to add to the thousand dollar account we call it a hill in the valley account\nThe hill and valley is the volatility of your income the hill is when they had to come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to set a couple of ground over there in that\nIn addition to the thousand two separate accounts one is for emergencies and one is for if you run out of money\nI don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow a analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run out of money\nI mean you can go make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me he made forty thousand dollars a real estate business I can imagine you having some zero much but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back on track your revenues in charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nAnd given in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are then okay\nSince some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is\nAnd uh but no we're not changing the emergency fun we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have a volatile income Mark's with us in Seattle Highmark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nAnd thank Dave hey it's a great honor to talk with you know you had a great impact on changed my life five years ago I'm getting I think you are currently I Am I going to ... question I'm In baby steps eggs are the only thing right now I'm paying off my arm does and I got a net worth of a half million dollars um [noise]\nWhat happened was five years ago I I left a small company with a great guy company culture when I hear you talk about your company that the company I was working for a very similar culture\nWas making an average salary or for what I did I went to a competitor I was much more of you making a I was making a eighty thousand dollars a year when you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year\nOn your question is what I make my question is is I really miss that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really\nReally interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work and um you know I should have to work every day I get great reviews um\nI'd probably go back but I Want some equity are I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually wars in the marketplace\nThis idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less\nIs not a necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with\nMaybe that particular company can't pay you but if you want you can always find somebody with an Asian culture\nThis is Dave Ramsey show\n\nThat you know statistically when it comes to life insurance and protecting your family that women are more likely to be uninsured or under insured than men this doesn't make any sense women make up half the workforce contributes mightily to family incomes\nAnd in many cases are the breadwinners and take care of their families twenty four hours a day lives as one of the most overlooked areas when it comes to financial planning\nMaybe it's a relic of the past but a loss of income or the need to replace family care is equally important for women as it is for men\nSingle moms working moms and stay at home moms all need term life insurance rates are actually lower for women which is why I send your lives and our insurance they shop the top term life companies to find the lowest rates available you can compare rates on line ... dot com or call eight hundred three five six\nAnd you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me\nThey treat you like crap and they over charge you for most of the services and this day in time there online offerings of their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated or not that good\nThey're not good at anything that I I just don't get it so that that's why we endorsed credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank\nAnd I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did\nEverything on doors on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation and that kind of a thing I don't have anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that I I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell you to get but\nYou know ... you know in most of these cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Ted how are you\nI'm doing better than I deserve how're you doing just the same how can I help alright well thank you and your staff for all you're doing a it's a blessing to um [noise] I Will be needing a life saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years I don't get hit by a bus\nAnd I want to know if I ah I should continue funding and age I stay with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks here or should I just put a that extra money into a ... her four one K. was it just\nI don't know if you can but you can hold their matching a couple of hundred bucks a year in more okay so the the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you're going to happen to ... what is it\nBinding deliver ooh I got I guess so yeah fortunately there's something you can't live without\nYeah heard that you know our guy I'd say it's a it's a slow a slow progression then\nYeah it is they they asked a mate that you know Seventeen years out okay yeah I got to figure to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to retire early you know Gadhafi if I can\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're gonna want is a ... you got to have the cash in your age are saying or somewhere else in an investment to cover what's going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking to health insurance is going to cover a large portion of this correct\nYeah that's if I don't retire um and I'll be on um either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or or I wouldn't retire because this is a guessing this is a multi hundred thousand dollar a minute there's\nProbably a half now\nAnd so I'm thinking we're going to term retirement around this a little bit um or and or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the cobra but the cover only last for two years or something\nUm I don't know you can keep that indefinitely so I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of those I don't want to\nTime that poorly a but then how much have you got coming out of pocket a over ten years you could put five thousand dollars a year end of that nature say or whatever your ... what's your deductible\n[noise] um\n[noise] ... me and my ...\n... or ... whatever that adoptable is on the age of say a year\nA buyout\nAge I say that health insurance amount of fun\nI don't know the ... or health savings account that is attached to a health and ... say health insurance policy that as a I ...\nIt it depends a dependent apology I pick it's either six to nine ... nine thousand\nBucks what I'm Talking about you can put up to that amount per year into that savings account\nAnd that would be six thousand yeah the other side fully fund that yes and I don't touch it until I you know pretty dire\nYes here's why so when you're when you need the money out of pocket to cover the whatever comes out of pocket on on the liver surgery a and you keep your health insurance in\nPlace then you've got this big juicy health savings account sitting there in and use mutual funds in it and let it grow over the next ten years be as big as a ... there's no downside of that whatever you don't need for the liver transplant or liver trans whatever the processors they're whatever you don't need you can pull out\nAnd just pay taxes on no penalties\nYou're going to want to build that up and you just not going to say it becomes over what you don't use you can use

five five two to five job and we'll talk about your life\nAnd your money it's a free call Shay is one of those in Reno Hi welcome to the day Ramsey show\n... thanks for taking my call today sure what's up on the health\nInsurance question for you and I'm hoping you could give me some insight on it we adopted our two children about three years ago and they came from the foster care system so we don't get a lot of service\nUntil they're Eighteen and it's provided through our state Medicaid system and every year my husband and I kind of go back and forth on whether or not to keep it or to put them on his plan through his employer and we're getting close to that um [noise] time of year to make that decision\nOkay um what would his employer's plan cover that Medicaid is not covering\nAll they've both been healthy thankfully I guess or um you know the thing we always come back to is unknowns of any kind of health issues that they may have er\nUm any services because even though the Medicaid coverage is crummy you know and a lot of ways a lot of doctors don't take it and it's a basically welfare insurance on it has covered their needs up to this point because those kids are healthy and they've had you know minimal minimal incidentally afraid\nIf they had some kind of a major event that he'll Medicaid would not do a good job of covering and that his insurance might\nActually it's more the opposite I'm not worried about the major stuff because like we've had to go to the ER for you know my you know just scraping them bumping they pick up the tab for everything it's more the ongoing care there is um you know it's very hard to find providers who take it there's a bit of a steak than we feel\nA little strange having that kind of coverage given our own financial position you know that our kids are on a on [noise] there is a bit of a stigma that oh I don't feel they're having it so it's just it's just kind of a dilemma we face every year and\nI and you are you know in November we can make a say oh I heard you uh uh you know free food stamps because you are adopted a foster child you know that would feel the same way as what you're saying um it\nWould yeah I mean I well I don't look at you know and he has to be ready to learn to type and that takes care of their you know their their financial needs and [noise] um so I don't know this is not an easy now so I'm not an easy question and does it\nCost to add them to your husband's policy\nUm I think it would be nothing given the policy we're on has a high deductible each has a plan that we have and there's no cost for that one and only\nThen why is it a question if it doesn't cost anything and it's better coverage\nIf I could find a loan for my founded six years ago ... you know any acts and I'm sure that a part of my babies who have here we got like he proposed to\nWell when you sign alone\nAnd they don't pay you get to pay it that's why they wanted to ... yeah so how much do you owe on the student loan\nAll twenty thousand what's your household income or about Seventy thousand Seventy okay and what is your son like\nA machine shed got a job about twenty thousand dollars a hour am for making about cleaning the five hours per week\nHe's working twenty hours a week yeah [noise] okay what's she doing with the rest of his time\nReality he he he\nDoesn't want to have a job that we know concrete quit his job because he's been trying to get into this job forever because\nWhy would a conflict with his job he's only working twenty hours a week\nRight 'cause he was on call 'em for this job\nTwenty hours a week or the whole week\nPlenty but we may be trying to call it for three years is a TV station he have Jerry I'm going to have a\nFootball game and the gang of six point at the game\nThen what would you be on call for football there is no emergency football\n[laughter] he's been trying to get into the TV station we're not that\nParties are working twenty hours a week and his mother is calling me 'cause she came buddies that dumb twenty thousand dollar bill I'd like for him to working forty hours a week on top of the twenties playing football yeah actually she said he can pay is freaking bills so you're not calling me how would that sound that would sound awesome\nI Try to tell him that when I get\n'em get down to come through and I think or not they're not happy with the girl\nHe paid the thirty in the late ... at least thirty degree every\nTime you don't work much yeah yeah\nThere's a great place to go when you're broke to work so uh what I Would tell him to do is get into financial piece university and get his young budding gear\nAnd start buying the ... I mean I bomb you I'm going to be all up on this kid because he's twenty eight years old and he's a slacker and his momma is calling me you're single\nAfter his mom's a single lady out here when your safety what I'm fifty\nFifty years old and you're having to pay this kid's bills\nAt him right now I don't want you to be two and a good loving mama's kind of way I'm not trying to disown him I just want to knock him out on his little head okay now and then you know you better plan on paying ... doesn't get\nMoving okay right so it really\nDoes you know ball and knock it out and then you know shock it up to that and but dude I'm telling you a word will have some discussions is he married\nI'll bet she works forty hours yeah there\nYeah there you go [noise] alright open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Katherine is with us from Portland Maine Hi Katherine how are you\nA thank you I don't hear about my budget I Do the every dollar budget among baby step to crank protect my expenses for them on [laughter] project what I'm going to be paying for debt and then sometimes\nSomething happens like last month when my car broke down I had to have a tone and repaired and it costs to almost five hundred dollars [laughter]\nIt was and how often that we know that one ... do you have your babies born with a thousand dollars right I Do now that would be an emergency that you would use that for\nOkay but that's what I was confused about because the way I handled it was I simply added a new line item to my budget for that item and then reduce the amount that I pay toward debt for that month so I get it wrong that would\nBe okay you cash flow did you just ... but if you can cash flow in that month that's fine I didn't have to come out of the emergency funds so you are paying more than five hundred dollars extra on that each month\nGood and so you reduced it by five hundred for one month 'cause you got kicked in the kneecap with this thing but usually you're not going to have that month than a month out now there's some things if a if there's a recurring unexpected event it no longer is unexpected\nFor inside you know you don't have anything budgeted for car repairs will that will not work because most cars are going to need some repairing over a period of six months you know they're going to have\nAnything that she did for car repairs\nYeah I probably would put something in there for that because the ... your budget needs to reflect the real world and the real world is you're gonna spend something on the car in a given six month period of time it might be tires that might be maintenance that might be oil change it might be a five hundred dollar toe you know\nBut you're going to spend something on a car in unless you're driving a really nice brand new cars you're going to spend something on the car during that time so your budget should reflect reality in that regard\nSo probably gonna add a little bit of a done it to be a lot fifty or a hundred bucks or something and let that build up\nAs a sinking fun they call it than the every dollar software or in them on below but I don't care where you build it up but somewhere you build it up and you ah have the money in cash then for your car repair as it comes up and that's an example of something that has recurring so it's no longer unexpected\nEmergencies should be unexpected things\nThings that are are often enough that we can expect them aren't emergencies anymore but you did good yeah you did fine just to cash flow through that emergency you slow down your debt snowball for that month and then you pick back up next month hopefully won't have another one of those and you can really\nBuild it up and go from there so good question and you're doing good keep after Tom is with us in San Francisco Hi Tom welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDo appreciate you're doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now\n[laughter] I mean can you monitor lewd we've been together a long time you and I [laughter]\nThe question for you so my wife and I we have about three hundred and then did another hundred and Eighteen and automobile mind accorded that type of thing so we're totally be\nAnd we make a pretty good income she's about one morning and you'll be more than a hundred come on the question for you\nDo you like that would be a very real are why on edge but over the last three days are sort of think maybe we shouldn't want to get your take on that a masters in one oh it would be ... ... ...\nAnd it would increase your income by more than twenty five K.\nIt would probably be hard to say I'm there would be when he came and raise the category of jump into ... ...\n... you would bring you in your bag and job would make it back in touch over a year then from that point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget as you make so stinking much money\nNow you living in a very expensive area granted crazy and can I ask you want to live in a really rough ... yeah but you guys are really only year release ... ...\n... and so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four\nHundred and two years if we do it in two hundred a year that may be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year and get out of debt plan\nBut you know vacations you don't\nNeed to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you dare taught me about pine anything else you bought enough\nYou need to and you need to live like people that make a hundred people that make three hundred and get this that\nFor an end of the budget for\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nTo be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dog ...\nHave to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new it finds them for you it's powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes identifies people with the ride skills education and experience for your job and actively\nCommunity college there's a lot less expensive and you can get your basics out of the way for the first two years for a four year degree if you want to show the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is college\nCost is the number one cause of student loan debt\nAnd what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a use to pick up truck both or transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of you to the mall\nAnd answer if you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley you can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to a super expensive college so you go to an end state school\nWas there in Florida you go to the University of Florida Gainesville or you go to University of central Florida right there in Orlando a wonderful wanna but wonderful both of them are in state tuition not that expensive and uh that's thing one your college selection\nAs at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need to aim at with rare exceptions and you're not going out of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make a scholarship hunting your full time job or\nAn after school job that kind of a thing and you start applying for and filling out the scholarship forms and riding the essays and he probably ask for a thousand scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just went to school for ...\nThat'd be pretty cool not a bad part time job the third thing is\nPlanning on working a lot while you are in school\nBorrow money so that you don't have to work work\nGet good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking cutting grass jobs people don't want to do what they pay a lot to do when I'm Talking about minimum wage crap and if you're going to live on campus go ahead and being alright be a residential advisor or read that's not what they call it what is an R. A.\nHow it is it is a resident about okay so there you know the the babysitter in the dorm okay and uh you get free dorm for doing that and sometimes free tuition for doing that and sometimes free tuition free dorm and pay for doing that she'll be in our a if you're going to live on campus\nOr work in the cafeteria get free food can live on campus if you can get a job working for the university the tuition might be completely free\nThat might be different to something to look at it so that's the kind of stuff you look at but figure out where you're going what steps are to get there\nSo somebody pays you to get there and then plant on working your butt off and those things will get you through school completely dead free in this day and time and it can be done Alex is with us in Baltimore hey Alex welcome to the day Ramsey show\nMr Ramsey ... thank you for everything that you do thank you\nA ... on that can be a call and what you want and I am debt free I'm On baby step three

with these kids who appreciate that\nThat is when I started trying to pay back but just being normal so I started my career in life I always had a prayer life when I saw the ... and says all the prerequisites for white had this apparatus\nI mean it is for kids that have nothing going from I even had some kids in my classes slide these\nThey want to draw so that would give them like coloring books in crayon and they would try so hard to keep those those those are cut that's occurring on it and then the lines are with the numbers more but some of them has such terrible if your parents who say they would\nRule follow insurance are shown coloring they withdrew their mouth ... was in school you were at\nWell I was just it was ... yeah I was a special ed teacher had different classes you know and just happen to be in these classes it was you know children like that okay we we clean it up for them it was nothing to rule because they said that all day long so that they didn't mean anything to them\nEr and er so anybody you know they would learn at a skill that they would never going to use you know there was no really cure for them back then even today just really no cure\nSo at a special ed teacher had a lot of time in my hand and the kids needed two hours for lunch for the teacher said would help feed them uh there's no papers to correct the bigger kids that had in the ...\nIn the room it used to move back as long I enrolled is you know when you see a tractor trailer pull up to warehouse and they put out there is eyeing roles and they put the boxes on him to shut them down and you know there's a lot of them don't you know\nYeah so this is the school supply I N roll is uh my class sideline up the kids I think until it can get a box but it on the island world he would slide down to the next kid they because they would open it up to find a dance and that could put something on the side of down to the next ... tape it you know so that's what they did if I had plenty of time\nSo you always know how to Boston so I started bartender the nightclubs and I believe this is a real prerequisite of what why this thing came to this house where are you doing two jobs John\nYeah I mean it is it being a specialty that didn't take up much of my time at a two hour lines I didn't have papers to correct you know so I decided you know it gets going to do this so [laughter] so um\nYeah so uh uh ... you know people at night that they're looking for fun now a lot of ... and the people but there was a certain percentage of people who don't know if they'll talk sided thing because these people are like little wicked have looking for a cause\n... alcohol or drugs or commit adultery anything they can get their hands on and a good portion of these people were atheists they went to the coast a little bit\nI mean I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody\nAnd this type of behavior didn't even bothering factor but she was hoping to use I noticed that a lot of these people died from accidents like car accidents overdoses suicide Kansas and [noise] and I bought it with these people in ... and I knew them you know up and I felt that these people like ships in the night\nWithout a runner any way that it's time to take them to do with the wind was blowing that was fine with them and they died this state that I thought nobody should die then we're the last ... unusually high\nYeah unbelievable\nAnd so um yeah I just didn't think they knew how to live I mean that's another thing is focused on the teacher as it teaches you the nose I self you know as I said to me is I'm not trying to be somebody else knowing they're so means knowing the truth about you\nYou are what they do look at what you do in LA so what do you do and then analyze what you believe about this stuff you might find it completely different person here\nI mean I had one friend I Try to get through this quick because I Know we want to get into his name is Chris he was a bartender he worked right alongside and he was an atheist and the used to make fun of God used to make fun of the just used to make fun of the urge to marry\nAnd smoke and drink every night seven nights a week\nI didn't feel well they went to visit a doctor and he found you're already had fought states can't oh ... so he couldn't work anymore so I tried to visit in between my you know going from the scope my school get off my night job or are we work together I mean it was like a friend you know I Know you had all these problems but you didn't know what\nI Know he had this for about forty is in a in a few months and he died within a few months but I Would go visit him and I would try to talk to him about God but he wasn't interested at all and he was even more ... George because the diagnosis he had four died he died and such a terrible state\nI felt like helpless form in my religion joins were told that people fall into hell like snowflakes from the sky especially if there's no one to pray for them\nSo I started praying for him and all these other people that I knew and bonded with and I felt they were friends of mine and I would ask God you know don't send these cells to held it unless you go to jail until I finished praying for them no matter how long ago it gives me on this planet no matter how many grains of sand they still got left an hourglass that's what I was going to do\nAnd I believe now that was the prerequisite of why this even creature was compelled to assess my house and they'll build that mosaic through your piece by piece right down to it every single detail\nNo object what we can really will let me ask you this little John did this demon follow you to the house basically or was it already there\nAbsolutely not absolutely not I've never had like a\nAnd I've never you know I never had ... invited to speak to here I never had to say on I never use a we keep a lot more I never use Tara ... I mean\nI I Believe that opens the door for me to like this to come in and then just anybody does that because I now I think if you allowed to speak to come in Hillsdale you harm I think he's permit him to do is worse well the only other time it had\nNo there's no doubt if you if you invited in its combing\nYeah that's what I Believe now but you do as long as it is\nAbsolutely not true as I've learned a lot from it I learned that it is and has a methodology able to discuss that too but the only other really other time [noise] ah well you know I thought that I worked in because that's why I wrote that book anyhow the bestselling book or you know if you're interested in any of that do have some funny stories about the rapid Chris Brown\nThat's that's the topic we don't touch [laughter] we don't let which we don't we don't get into that topic\nOh okay [laughter] so anyway\nPeople probably why it too was basically what you've seen on the outside but go ahead\nYeah okay so the idea of the time that I ever\nKnew about a person who encountered the demon that I Believe was because my brother my brother Paul he we got is a rare a if a blood disease that runs in the family and my my dad was unfortunate that get it and they killed him very early in the sixties\nThey had a heart attack and died at the same time there was an forcing it for you to get it are you OK yet that seems to me are you are right\nHere what with the blood disease\nI haven't I I've been sacked with that yeah oh yeah ah the doctor who well let me tell you what happened to pull in and I'll tell you so poorly wakes up and he has the same symptoms my dad had\nHis than say dollars nine one one they ... they come and they take him to the hospital and at the hospital he dies on a hospital bed and when I went to visit him later on he says to me John ... you know\nAnd I heard that he died on the hospital but that's what the doctors told me sit down and when I died on a hospital that I left my body he says I left my body and I watched that doctors frantically\n... find that get it back to life again if they'd be late and not on comedy shows\nAnd yeah and the alarms going off and said like when I talk about the fifth dimension of space to have to mention he stepped into that for him and he was still so he's still thought he was in a hospital room because he could see what was going on with his body\nThey said isn't that hospitable he said to me it and it and then there was a dark side of that room he says and theme is came from a small team is not like big ones like three foot for for totally say came to me\nAnd it was ... me and was shot in the ... area of the room which I which I say is the cause they they overlap sometimes and I believe that's where we left him and fifth dimension and uh they were drag him into that talks on the room\nAnd he said I mean Johnny why didn't even know yeah I'm not really that big of a parent you know I understand that why would even come ran it was like oh I really don't know\nUh I don't know if anybody but now I Know that you know all of us are great the same way like you know kind of religion confirmed in our religion he was too but he dropped out and okay and they go to church anymore okay he met a woman he didn't really married but OK yeah again I tell them you know it got kid\nIt never gave them a religion and anyone you can't even ... one one\nPrayer maybe like I'm not a well I don't know maybe get a big kick in your but sometimes when you when you're passing it at the mentioned you know that\nThat we were at overlap somehow on John we're in a break but we'll come back and talk more\nThe ... website is no streamline for mobile devices read news if your coast insider or simply want to enjoy our website on your own business coast to coast am dot com on your iPhone or Android rows are\nWay way\nWay\nEverybody should be some either in fact I tell everybody to use on my ...\nTotal solution to any type of work you would ever want to do around your house and best of all it's completely free you know to\n[noise]\n\nThen we'll come back to coast to coast joined you know where he was Jewish the devil has approached you were going to take calls next Dahmer was drawn you can join let's pick up the story about your brother your your brother it's a time what happened\nYeah so I'm just to recap uh I mean this is probably the only time I've ever had an encounter with a devil that I Believe that you know I Know my brother wouldn't lie to me about it\nAnd he wasn't really a bad person I mean he left his religion like we talked and then he he lived with the woman who didn't get married so in any rate has kids they didn't have a religion so\nUh you know I felt that made me but he said you know to me ... you know when I died on that hospital that I left my body I watched the doctors frantically\nTrying to get me back to life again with the latest and the nurses running back and forth sticking things my aunt and it could have the alarms going off but he was in that like that they mentioned that overlapping dimension I guess\nAnd he said it was like a duck part of that room which probably never was there when he was in the hospital but when he was in that overlapping dimension and he even came for him and he asked me why why the demons ... man I was I really don't know why why you know I just don't know how to explain that either\nI I never had this problem I never had a problem like this before I before I had this adverse and in my house but ah\nI Wonder about it a lot but he says he says it's completely one hundred and eighty degrees turn man he's a very religious man now\nThis is Maria ... scared the heck on every move in\nA can of have to believe it\nI mean to actually be dying dying and then leave your body that something you know she's gonna remember he's still young guy is only like forty years old he's got a lot of life ahead of him but he now has a very religious person but uh\nHe encountered this statement but the one that I encounter with a very different like I tell you that the ...\nYou know what was the first episode for huge on this demon showed up what\nThey all K so uh let me explain to I live in New Jersey like the middle of New Jersey right in the ... area I have a house that sounded like an acre property so far how far Hoboken or you know pretty far from there is a good hour though oh are you from Hoboken\nAnd the sounds so natural one ...\nOh yeah that was born in Brooklyn I thought that far from home but now I live in New Jersey\nSo oh yeah so I just wanted to say because I had a best selling book I was able to retire and I didn't have to work with those I Love those kids believe me but I ... I I stopped working but may not have to work it yeah I guess you just stop\nAnd I stopped sending at night I Love bartending at night but ... and that but I stopped but I still know about those people and they still pray for those people and that's a big ... big prerequisite of white ... I'm In New Jersey now I'm doing fine ... I have a very uh elaborate prayer life\nUh I I retired from my my my job as a special ed teacher retire to not working at night and I miss those people a lot to\nKind of have this nice house and it's like ... okay about a hundred and fifty feet from the street is on a hill it come in to the house and the the garage is under the house and you pull your car into the left and you go into the garage descendants a back door the it comes to the garage\nAnd in between the garage and the basement is this big indoor\nAnd other ... I had three boys here growing up and I think a little bit bigger they want to a little more room so I had the basement finished and uh I cut it in half and I had an apartment building down there so my first why is that he wants to more space\nAnd what was once I guess\nYeah so it's nice so then he goes to college and he moves out thick and boy wants to have ... so he takes it he goes to college and move them by third boy\nThey once had a problem and he ... he was in there he he was here this whole time so he's a when I had\nThe he was smart one free rent [laughter]\nYeah well I didn't mind doing what we were we had this big house and then like when he he he went to college he moves out but he got a job\nAnd then he said you know can I moved back home I just want to start my own business as they come back home because I mean we are it's a big house and my wife has this empty nest syndrome sure and I mean so and I like having a a a company to you know somebody to come upstairs and have dinner with you once in a while when when you tell me wasn't home that much but he's moved out since then he got a great often focused but anyway he's here the whole time\nSo that stuff there and so in the basement you come in that that I indoor steps that go up to the kitchen\nWas a big kitchen they okay if you're in that case and you can almost hear that do an enclosed and the next to the kitchen is living ... most of the time George and uh that's what I like I go to the gym in the morning then I meditate and\nIn the afternoon I meditating at night and meditate so I have a pretty long for life and I took I did get back to my work 'cause I Am good as as a small little towns that God gave me you know\nSo uh I'm doing that and everything's fine to it for years and I've been praying for these little cells that I felt will last those every day for years and I was like I said I'm going to do that until the first time I have left here\nSo everything's fine and then a bank yeah so then yeah I'm saying I'm sitting in the liver and that I into a downstairs I'm by myself and I hear that I into her ex slam lucky\nYou normally wouldn't even hear it from in the in living memory I have a slam is never was slammed before when I'm thinking to myself when you know somebody's open Oh absolutely you in a house that\nTwenty five years you know every noise in the house you know\nSo I'm thinking I said what was that it was an eye on I think my wife could even if he came home a slant like I don't even think he gave him slim that do that hard\nAnd maybe my son can I don't know why he was doing it let's say at a car accident or with a girlfriend broke up with them or something like that so I'm thinking what is that so I get up I go to the kitchen I look down stairs usually when somebody comes in down near the puts up with the lights on those still talk to you so I go into the ... I have a\nUs surveillance system here I said look into the cameras and they roll back the cameras ten Fifteen twenty minutes I think nobody was on the property\nI look at the cameras had faced the garage doors nobody nobody open those gr watch those I look at the camera their faces that during the back nobody went through the backdoor and or what you went through distinctly hurt at all but [noise]\nOh absolutely slam yeah like slant\nI didn't know it at the time that we can discuss this creature was using his methodology on me and had a method\nIt wasn't it was telling me that wasn't here for social call that wasn't passenger with and now explain that in a minute so I go I look in the cameras\nNobody was on a property in the basement I got I got bars on the windows but you can get out as a you know if there was a fire in the house he does on lock them and jumped onto so I Know he couldn't get anybody if somebody was trust me I think I couldn't see them so I go say turn the lights on in the basement and I go down to the basement\nThat looking everywhere\nYou pretty convince you think somebody's in the house don't you\nOh absolutely no actually the only problem is but when I'm looking around I feel like\nI've been in the past twenty five years they feel is menacing sinister 'em and is like the only word to describe this like evil like an evil choice then I ...\nYeah I'm looking at it the\nWay I looked on the steps and look anyway somebody could squeeze himself into behind a washer and dryer in my son's room underneath his bed and his claws that you know and the furniture to him I look I look at my frantic look and I still have this horrible feeling so I'm thinking\nWell I I Know I looked at them\nBut I still have this\nReally menacing finished the feeling that come upstairs and I sit down and I'm thinking about it\nAnd then I you know and then all of a sudden I hear this wedding steps between the basement and and and and the kitchen and I have something they really heavy and like I could hear when my wife comes up the steps a hundred and twenty pounds my son comes up to ... and ... they found any of those steps down where he's against something very silly crossing those steps\nAnd thinking to myself I guess ... down here you know nothing was here\n... coming up the steps\nYeah I feel something very heavy slowly coming up with stuff like it up again I go over there and look there's nobody there so I'm thinking\nWe were you harmed her own armed at this time\nI I have I have a a registered gun you know you did okay [laughter]\nBut I but I didn't see anything so you know what I mean I looked into cameras I looked through the cat with him I Would assume it's something that no I didn't feel like a you know but I don't think\nI was wondering if that had that feeling of something very menacing sinister and I think it is could this possibly thing but then they started to shake it off to us because he like I'm just the guy I don't think that's you know it's\nGoing to happen and what have you on where you convinced that there was this creature demon in the house\nWhen it actually I actually had the ... but I Want to try to build up to that before actually tell\nYou we're running out of time so we're going to get to ... yeah oh ... or do we have another hour though you\nKnow we're taking calls that were\nOkay so okay so my wife comes home he says is this the first thing that comes in is like a\nA ... you know it's everything All right with you I was everything right where they have to feel something really weird and the south and it's like yeah I Do too but I don't know how to explain it so she says she's sitting there and\nGoing to show you the difference to seven seven thirty three living close to seven seven thirty three eleven\nAd WWW dot capital city Ruben dot com capital city roofing recapitalize Ruben industry well\n[noise]\nMaster control center says is W.

I probably would have ... on the street I put the rosaries on Nicholas table was on my right to begin with it was on his left so and I got up I'm standing in front of and say look down\nOn his left me she's my role is going to look back at me you know they were there the whole time\nAnd he his face us to blow up\nAnd he's a ... a big piece of saliva flies out of his mouth right onto my ... and he said that slowly to in any look back at me\nSlowly right in my eyes again with its black guys that had no people is just said black guys and it just looked at me like that and then it just back out\nIs slowly as they came in and backed out that slowly like nothing could threaten it on nothing could hurt it oh it stayed where they want us to do to my rosy says nothing I can do about it and he just as the fact that he just was looking at me straight and you know I said he back though to slowly as they came in\nAnd then those blue blue raging fire that I couldn't hear or smell or see anything burning off at a at that stuff to dissipate and then the the rippling came back from per second or two and that and that and that the ... and that's disappeared\nAnd he never came back\nWell the next day I'm thinking to myself\nA because I'm Catholic and the Bible tells me I could raise the debt hill is sick that theme is in Jesus his name so I go to church the next thing I come back here I get to my wife she's totally water in it and then in the kitchen I take that Hollywood and every single whom I say in the name of Jesus Christ that commanded them leave the immediately I go through every single room\nAnd I'd be I'd need dumping buckets of holy water all over the house [laughter]\nI go through every single room I got to even go in the attic and furnished from everywhere and I think closets why go into the classroom George I'm saying that in the last room and I feel I Wish the curtains and the blind Swiss\nAnd I feel it will lead and uh I I felt the ... the evil presidents

came the thing was ... it was powerful enough to uh uh to manipulate a dimension or was powerful and intelligent enough to uh uh tell me what it ... would have wanted to tell me and I don't know who I Am many and\nMany in bus to forest joined those three messages you said that this creature those and to Detroit do reports on you what what were they use it as long as you said they had three messages that one of the matter is\nNo more with with the first message\nTo me no more okay\nWant to say that I thought what is a visit me and say okay now I think I Know it's I mean I'm praying for these cells the cells coming to him it and the other message was the other thing it said message that said oh when I was looking at this loop where he thinks playing that he says owning my spirit with feel the effects that\nYou know that was my wasn't the spirit or didn't affect me but I guess that fast I mean it was God's burning the ... percent so that was the message that I understood from it and then\nOf course I said I Am Mandy and many my wicked deny so it helped me a message of his says many of these creatures they are but I mean you know when you read the Bible you know like I said I'm skeptical myself I\nDon't read the Bible a third of the you know like these creatures is powerful ones like this one topic convince all these other about a third of the angels so break break off they probably didn't want to eat what's gone anywhere we wanted to break off on their own they ... they convince a third of these things will follow them so this and many\nYeah big mistake to follow them let's take some classes where they in March first time caller in Phoenix, Arizona you Ron with us go ahead mark\nGuards are there that I've had\nThat experience with what he's calling the fifth dimension twice in my life that's the only difference is is I experience was I met face to face with your with God and that's not it's not a demon or a devil\nYou were the lucky ones [laughter]\nThough this out of curiosity it got to say anything to you yeah well I was\nGoing through some tough times in my life and I I was basically praying for the turn of Christ you were praying for ... for the return of Christ\nOr you know and uh he basically encourage man and went through a whole series of whether I had to face to believe this could happen to that could happen anywhere that's that's part of the story but but in the end\nAnd he said well if I gave you the power to you know have crashed returned right now would you do it and\nAs soon as he asked me that I started thinking about all the law schools and I I just I just said no I Can't there's too many people that needs to be saved jak\nThat's what I'm saying I mean yeah you know we we love price who wanted to see 'em but once he comes that's it right at the end isn't it I mean\nAs you warmer the Russian yourself John and just ask yourself why is this demon visiting me I'm not a bad guy I'm not evil what what she wants me\nOh I Know what he wanted with me I knew that he wanted me to stop praying and I know they didn't want me to pray for these cells I give them a second chance you know because they didn't have it here\nAnd I felt I bonded with these people I've befriended the people I knew them I didn't hang out with him because they were kind of like I said live and work at a new ways but I

was I guess it was this\nHe had the idea of a vulture\nA pale blue eye was a film over it\nWhenever it fell upon the my blood Rand cold and so by degrees very gradually I made up my mind to take the light for the old man and PSAs written myself of the eyes forever now this is the point you fancy me mad Mad Men no nothing\nBut you should have seen me you should have seen how wisely I proceeded with what caution with what foresight with what the simulation I went to work\nI was never kinder to the old man did during the week before I killed him every night about midnight I turn to latch on his door and opened did oh so gently and then when I had made an opening sufficient for my head I put in a dark line through\nClose death no light show now and then I watched in my head or you would have left to see how commonly ice ... and\nI moved slowly very very slowly so that I might not disturb the old man sleep it took me an hour to play smart Bullhead within the opening so far that I could see him as he\nAnd have been so wise as this and then when my head was well in the room I ended the lantern cautiously also cautiously cautiously for the hinges creek [noise]\nI ended it just so much that a single then re fell upon the vulture high\nEnd this I did for seven long nights every night just estimate died but I found the ... always closed and so it was impossible to do the work\nFort was not the old man who ... me but his evil lie and every morning when the day broke I went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him calling him by name and a hearty tone and inquiry and how he has passed the night\nSo you see he would have been a very profound old man indeed to suspect that every night just at twelve I looked in upon him wildly slept\nUpon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious and opening the door of watches emitted hand moves more quickly than did mine never before is that night had I felt the extent of my own powers of mice aghast

were close fastened through the robbers\nAnd so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door and I kept pushing it on steadily steadily I had my head in and was about to open that lantern when my thumb slipped upon the tin fascinating and the old man spring up in bed crying out who's there\nI kept quite still and said nothing for a whole hour I did not move a muscle and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down\nHe was still sitting up in the bed listening just as I have done night after night harkening to the death watches and the wall presently\nI heard a slight grown then I knew it was the grownup mortal terror it was not a grown the pain or of grief it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with all I knew this sound well\nMany at night just at midnight when the whole world slapped was wild up from my own ... deepening with the dreadful echo the terrorists that distracted me\nI say I knew it well I knew what the old man felt didn't pity deal although white chuckled at heart\nI knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise when he turned into bed his fears had been ever since growing upon him\nHe had been trying to fancy them cause less but could not\nHe had been saying to himself it is nothing but the wind in the chimney it is only a mouse crossing the floor or is merely a cricket which has made

I met a lot of really beautiful people from Arkansas and it always strikes me as somebody who is a free wing either blue or red in my in my tribal political identity that seems to be polarizing the country as your report said\nWorse than ever before um but when I actually go out of mind blue range into the red range of Americans I meet really decent beautiful people\nWho and I listen to them and I can see so much potential if people would just stop listening to this ratings the rating the horrors of of a mainstream news\nAnd just wouldn't talk to each other\nAnd they don't talk anymore John that's no problem nobody touch screen they argue but I've\nActually found the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive [noise] and I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington state\nAnd uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together already a this forecast which is the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team that you just mentioned\nAnd uh I was just reading it again after many months and I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put in it's a that was basically is happening\nIs a\nA level of if you're gonna defined it in planets there's two major planets in astrology and political strategy their plate right now\nIs a is Iran is and just recently come in to tourists\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn is centered and long story short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in the story in fine which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations\nWhereas the earth the sign of Capricorn Saturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it\nFavors the establishment more than it favors those who are resisting the establishment\nUm because Iran has in horses in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this\nThis ruler of Aquarius is in the least comfortable sign\nThat it's transferred him through now last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tourists it did two major changes in political astrology it brought the German Third Reich into being under adult Hitler\nAnd it also uh aged Franklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to destabilize established a banking ideas and things that were restructured that\nIn in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of the ... in history [noise]\nAh that happened because of the reforms of the banks those reforms has slowly been chipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms than Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same kind of demographics of the of the separation between the fuel the and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth is almost exact\nJust before the crash and so we are repeating a cycle and uh so the the issue is their\nIran as if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in the Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovators that person was original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House and it is a it is expressing itself with great passion\nAnd unpredictability but its negative it's about destroying from getting the house by\nGetting the Senate back but for what\nIt's not really defining itself is what we know what the resistance is against when I hear it all every day here because I live in the very heart of it here but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if and if you follow this pattern\nWith much more energy to it then it happened before 'cause I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said don't go a Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six I was on a show in Portland\nBut five hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man who had a meltdown says you're absolutely crazy that can happen and of course four years later I said well no one will happen because if you're ... anybody but bill\nClinton you're you're you're you're fundamentally a you don't have anything to replace him except you're on tearing down and then what\nAnd it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before at least at least and and it's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media avenues\nThat it's really quite and it's classic um Iran is confusion and it's fallen Taurus you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud\nOr assign muddy place a swamp the muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come and save you from yourselves\nAnd you know I've been how long long time first with art and then with the huge orange I've been\nTalking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it is really at hand now it's um\nIt's not going to be when I look at it when I look at the um situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where your ... going retrograde its back going backwards in in the sky which means that it's a time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world [noise]\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around of just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into aries now what that means is that if\nIf red voters Fred American voters go to the polls early [noise]\nThe old on her second John already at the break we'll come back and we'll talk more about this or get into some of his top ten forecast for this year she how close he's coming and uh also march twenty third you live in Everett, Washington\nJust circle that date for two thousand Nineteen will tell you about that later to\nAnd now ...

use the code coast at checkout that's blind stir dot com lines T. E. R. dot com [noise]\n\n\nBy the way have you sold visor dot com for some home projects that they are really good you just put in what you're looking for and you get a number of different ... names and the other all qualified picked the one you want but\nSuperb workers Broadway John ... with us as we talk about prophecy predictions Joe we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many of come true already\nWell uh there have been a number I'm more of a shocking been my my crop the what I did it is basically short um chapters that takes a theme\nAnd one to give us some headlines on some of them the ten real quick\nWell you see the were the the definition of the year being the year of exhilaration\nAt definitely things have intensified that way the second prophecy was a year on us in the last chance sec style but look at the play between Iran is in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground\nBut that petered out by may ... and that seemed to happen in a way where there was also the third prophecy will Trump be impeached or not in twenty eight team and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise]\nUh I've always said that both candidates in twenty sixteen were afflicted astrological we both had the danger if not if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means believe office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I hate to see in this\nBut that they could leave in scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January [noise]\nSo it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before that the first half of the day goes to the red states and the red voters say get out early they vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in the week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house of representatives [noise]\nWe'll see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon so it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see in eleventh hour or\nClose to the polls are turned around so with that um you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I was simply say about President Trump that\nIf he survives this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president uh\nWhat's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family their holy arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and try and taking notes\nTaking notes and it's like you I mean literally is a large family members and other things are are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise] um every everybody watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in the fall and tourists\nUh they're they're they're just watching the news and there's assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the little blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until six feet or if he's a two term president according to my interpretation of the strategy they're going to give him a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge also the other thing that uh\nEvangelical rice said ... ...\n...\nYou know I said ten months before Trump was elected I said the the big upset could happen through their\nUm and so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving\nIt's almost like it's it's a musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats at the same number of seats\nJust switching back and forth\nAnd in that there's not enough to create any significant legislative advance so it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before and it's almost unbearable now\nWell it's I I hate to say to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this crisis that's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states and the world\nIs just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually think of a way to get out of this merge and say it's kind of have to get much worse and frankly installer Gees are saying that\nThey're not going to see a a tide shift until the middle of the next decade or we're\nWe're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail\nYet we're not even close it's going to get much worse and what's going to happen was kind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh and all the small fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I said very clearly in my back in August eleventh in my articles than the Kavanaugh would be picked\nThat um [noise] I I think people are stabbed pushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not the thing they should be looking at according to their needs [noise]\nIf you look at cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think there'll be weighed it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme Court no I I don't think so\nA lot but I tell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planet so next year and into twenty twenty\nThese these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two major corporate establishment will power\nThat you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see who is creeping coup d'etat of corporate uh hedging money which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's a sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent citizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened\nAnd so it's possible that after twenty twenty with the American people or or the working people people started really starting to get riled about situation or there will be basically in a completely corporate elite control the United states\nAll I Hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more [laughter] a\nRecently were on the History Channel or the so called the last hope and the Catholic Church of course but under fire for all kinds of atrocities late ...\nHe and uh it was um [noise] it was a unique experience and and it's put me in a position that that show uh\nI

al ...\nI had already taken children and use them and some gassing attack that's the story I'm trying to track down\nAnd we're going to be broadcast is still as he started as a once again another

they'd ... achieved a parody and march first this year\nThey delayed they're putting the delayed his address to the nation of Russia and then he so he could see what what the military changes the rules of engagement was going to happen with the Americans\nHe I I actually quoted a lot of this speech and it shows it's very interesting look at how we've been in an arms race again with Russia because we pulled out of the ab a missile treaty\nAnd which was a seriously destabilizing move to unilaterally do it for a long story short they had to create a new system of of weapons that could be a deterrent to was surrounding Russia's steadily with a anti ballistic missile batteries\nTo basically be able to shoot down their missiles so they couldn't defend themselves\nA very very destabilizing move a hardly reported\nSo the Russians declared in March first ... pretty much we're in this Cold War and they have now made a parity you know the interestingly enough fruit and drops ten billion dollars off the eighty billion dollar budget of the Russian defense\nThe same time Trump adds another thirty seven billion to something that's past seven hundred billion if you add the other sides to it were really spending one point one trillion dollars [noise]\nUh on defense spending in our military ironically it's half of what the US people produce monetary lead GDP every year which is exactly what happened at the same time when the Soviet Union collapsed\nIt was paying half of its money into its big military and they collapsed\nWe're doing the same thing so uh it's it it

back coast to coast George story what's your John ... with us we'll get to your calls in just a second I just add one more area to talk with John about and he's writing a book about the lead celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and\nBoy you sparked my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a a tale of two suicide a and both of us committed suicide the reason I Am speaking to you is because [noise]\nMy experience with suicide was a spiritual suicide rather than the usual what I call mundane suicide how hot it most people encounter\nUm basically in the mundane suicide I contend that you end up with your pain destroying the body mind that you that you're mystery of Seoul is living in\nBut in the suicide that happened to me rather than the one that I was indeed mundane ... going to do [noise]\nI saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and I remained [noise]\nAnd so this is one of my most intimate autobiographical tales of a whole other dimensions of my life ...\nAll these years I've never known this\nWhen I was I was I was walking through a golf course in San Pedro California I just come back from India and I was still in the tender opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher and India for the first time and when it came back in the world the world that was not a place that supported this kind of individual flowering and I was having a very bad day\nAnd so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful golf course adjacent to the trailer park I Lived in [noise]\nAh overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliff and I thought I was walking it just dawned on me as as I could just keep walking or be on these cliff and climate down three hundred feet into the rocks and\n[noise] I had this amazing unexpected experience of life and death suddenly being very tangible unclear I got to see how they're really one there really\nThere are plenty of compliment trees or in our fear there or play of terror and opposites\nBut what was happening to me the feeling was trying to describe it but it's beyond where it's really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um it was descending on me faster than myself and I thought okay this is happening because I have made the decision to throw myself walk over this cliff\nIf I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences overtaking me this mystery of life meeting death\nSo I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat up against and I said okay before throwing myself over I just want to feel this and take this with me over the edge [noise]\nAnd so I sat there there's going inside and feeling it at some point I felt this electrical energy just rise above the ground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass\nOr I just began sobbing sobbing and suddenly all of that thank God all of that you saw that otherwise I wouldn't be killing the euro no not at all and uh\nAnd and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turn and there was a little eucalyptus trees and it was just shivering it sleeves and the Santa Ana wind and it was just this moment where ... sky the earth tree\nExistence love me existence sees\nEverything that's created out of it as a phenomenal creation rising and falling as something absolutely integral significant [noise]\nAnd I had this feeling that so much of what society does to make us feel in significant when you go in even at that moment of life meeting death insignificant becomes in significant\nI it's so the story is really an ... it's a it's a jump from what I usually you write about but it's a whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the ... is a book back in Nineteen Ninety nine sometimes my these books you see I\nI don't write these books they right they use me to write themselves and\nI had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died\nHow deeply he his his suicide how much he was loved and how many many people were shot in the story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this book I mean the cashiers line\nAnd there's this old lady and she's doing something looks like she's never done before she's pulled actually a magazine out of Iraq and looks at it and it's a people magazine a van seaboard Dane and I've watched how she touched his cheek on the picture the way she did it was so\nIntimate and beautiful and that's when I realized you know I Love him just as much and I think I think I understand what he was going through he was not a man to bullies\nOr in fairy tales and imaginary stuff and that Santa Claus is going to save him from his sends an already about it's really pretty attractive and and and and people like that when they die and I always feel there is a person that has the potential to become a an awakening one\nAnd I as I have been in my private life which I'm sharing more and more now in this period especially now when there's so much turmoil when there's so much I'm a mixed and polarity my entire life\nInto my work because it is is still ... point this center of silence in peace in the cycling of life that's becoming stronger and stronger that\nIs what I can share with all of you and meditation the science of self observation\nIs is what what more and more I always thought my my work with evil more and more and it's still prophetic but it's going to have more of my own authority through my own experiences\nSuch huge on let's take some calls here in the ten minutes we got left Thomas in Iran but John Home Tom\nHi George thank you for taking my call an job while [laughter] it's hard to follow your sharing of your experience on that but my question John is for a person to walk in the world to be a participant in the world\nHow can they develop their own centered ness so to speak such that they are I don't know what did on a\nDead on touch my personal and planetary astrology\nWell where I can only suggests and\nI think only anyone who's honest and heart to heart with anybody is all I can suggest as my own experiences the meditation techniques that I've been using since Nineteen eighty [noise]\nAnd uh so my answer to that is if any of you listening to this resonate with what I've been saying [noise]\nEspecially with the issue of suicide in life meeting death [noise] um I Am on a path where I can say there is a way to look the on and not be touched you can be passionate and deeply into life but you're not overwhelmed ... you can be a Buddha and the marketplace but not of the marketplace of the world\nAnd that was what my teacher taught oh show\nAnd that is what I've live since Nineteen eighty since I went to India to see him for the first time and so with that said if you

population center forever or is it all the ...\nAh it's a will there's a little like that yeah it probably it there's a part of it that really doesn't make sense of sort of stops at the eighty two bath in a in a district sixty nine from like ... comes in all the way over it it just really don't make sense because it's just on the backside of well you\nWill go through the redistricting process and twenty twenty ... and you'll understand why they did that yeah um because in order for it to be legal and constitutional there have to be certain balances and these districts that part of it too is I'm not so much talk accounting but still kinda like green county\nUh there are twelve houses in green county better in a district that is adjacent\n[laughter] and the reason that they're there to fold one is the representative from the adjacent county owns a piece of river property right there and\nThe other reason is they want the if it's just a one county\nBut one representative county mhm that representative has sole discretion over whether the local legislation comes through right but if it's two people then they have to agree mhm and so they try to sneak Republicans at a Democrat districts that way kind of do that so I don't know if\nThat had snuck a Democrat and Republican district yeah probably accomplish in Afghanistan and then forty two comes way on there to Jimmy ... district he yeah yeah it's way down there as well but the gym is a good guy yeah you've got about fifty five thousand people in the ... county I think and what kind of like eighty something thousand\nAnd so I've got just a ... a small section of middle broke I don't even have as much mail broke his Paul back man had\nA before that they changed the line so but you know ... is growing so

we are yeah I mean it's you know you stay in the same group organization\nThose people you know I'm the majority of them are going to are going to like you\nSo you've got to get outside of those groups where people don't have a clue right clue who you are you're you're twenty eight twenty nine twenty eight um\nWhen's your birthday or February oh so you're almost a shared birthday with a Lincoln do you really memory was worried the twelve twelve and February sixes Ronald Reagan's that's right and I think so if everybody George Washington day where they ... you also born in a log cabin there's no um I was not born in la [laughter] well\n... it was like hey listen I went out on a limb not on a limb because I I Believe in you know I think you could do a great job I think you don't have a long and distinguished career in Alabama politics I really do believe that uh whether or not you want that that's a real um I Believe that's what's gonna happen\nBut I don't I don't usually in doors candidates or tell people who to vote for I I usually you know maybe express my friends say I'm going to vote for this person you I took a little different tactic um\nI wasn't wild about your primary upon it but I didn't think he was like a bad guy or do you think it does and I just felt like you'd sort of had his long and distinguished career already and it was started by senator over the reins to somebody else [noise]\nUm but I went on a limb and I just said listen if a guy like we'll does means you can't get elected\nThan we might as well close the Alabama State house and moved to Georgia because\nYou you have kind of the perfect story the perfect background you're from the area I think like seven generations from the area try so it's not like anyone is going to know or love the area better\nAnd uh and you got to heart for service that that just shows I mean you could just tell when you meet somebody a man around this long enough you can tell who's in it for themselves and you can tell who's in it because I agree what they love their community you can't can't you days\nYeah no I totally agree with that that you can tell and uh I remember the first time that we were in here before the primary or white or right before the run off and ah yeah I was very impressed and\nI mean like ... and so we both behind this business a long time\nIt takes a lot to impress me I'm what you did it so you know what I really believe that for whatever that's worth you know that and uh how many votes you need to beat the Democratic house right that's right that's right ah well I think he's right I mean I think they I think that you got a good future ahead of you\nAs you know laws and I don't think that you're you know I kinda know where your heads I don't think you're gonna get sucked into the state house game which is what happens there are a lot of eighth yeah um but I think you've got to get ahead on your shoulders\nI'm I'm also being told don't forget about buildings like because dates full and Alabama's just basically peaceful and buildings\nYeah that's right [laughter] now my mom's from\nMy grandmother all my uncle ... live there and still is right across from the football yeah well they're that close to actually build a are right back ... nobody else that says different beliefs I live in ... county no\nBill usually starts about Choctaw elevated and and ends right where they will start DOMA [laughter]\nGotta get back on track\nPeople than other than a geography lesson is or the the ... I I'm not going to review all these text messages but the the amount of text messages I get\nAbout people trying to guess what people are like based on their voice is a lot it's it's incredible it's incredible um so tell people a little bit about you because I'm getting the text messages or people meet me now for the first time over there\nYeah so I'm uh twenty eight year old small business owner or one of my best friends and I have a have a foreign company together um I'm also a youth pastor at best Salem Baptist church out towards ... and I have a wife amber and together we have a son that's a little over to his name's Pratt\nThank you random version or our number two seven to nine two to eight if you want to get some attention means and I left that hopeful note hopeful covers a lot of ground it does yeah that's true but it is nothing\nIt is like Rhode Island to Alaska compared to billings ally and diesel [laughter] so I don't want to hear the whole whole conventions these coming in and act like they got a big help all basically just runs from\nWhat a\n[noise]\nGosh Davenport area up to through lounge county up\nTo the Hyundai place I mean that's nothing opine\nLevel just overtook Urbina doors to the gym is then going up going up highway thirty one so\nFine level loses listen ... originality alone pine level loses you know which was the original north or south oh say 'cause there's two of them where there's final south in South I'm going to get you know which ones I mean originally I was the south one really I must say the north\nI I honestly don't house down there you go they're going to the beach do you go through them away the true yeah I don't know which way in that way or the or ...\nAbout the boots insights into what\nYou know I Want to touch on something that was you're doing the ad about um about unemployed poise market and uh you know one thing to Alabama is leading the way in in in a in some areas as workforce development Scott to continue to improve and continue to grow and but you know being a small business owners or something that\nWe are really struggling with this finding young people\nAre coming out of school that want to go in and learn a trade like laying carpet or laying heart towel there's a lot of money in it\nBut they don't want to put in the years and that time it takes to learn the trade and so uh at foreign companies across the board the tradesmen who who install the flooring or are older and if you think about you go into a building every building here\nThere is some type of finished product on the floor carpet towels something and but fewer and fewer people are getting into the foreign business and and it really is a trade I mean it's a crash\nHow do you find somebody in that business that knows what they're doing so you you go through the I mean I think it's I think it's a good example for other businesses bribes there are a lot of businesses that are that way they they they're hiring for a specific skill that people don't necessarily have\nSo my dad has been in the foreign business as far as sub contracting installing for rat forty years so he's got a lot of connections in my business partner has been in the field for almost twenty and\nAh so he's got a lot of connections but still all up your connection are getting older [laughter] yeah I mean they're just getting to that age where they you know some of them just can't do what they used to could there weren't so great but uh but just there's not younger people wanting to spend the time to really learn the art\nAnd so we've got to figure out a way to to develop our workforce on trades I that I mean for just one of many trades is really struggling to find people that really want to put out have a quality job a ... and do it the right way what\nAlabama is a song statistic during the campaign that uh [noise] in three years and the next three years Alabama even if we don't recruit a single additional job to Alabama will have one hundred thousand more\nJobs that need to be filled by skilled trades workers than they have skilled trades workers to fill those jobs so it will be at a hundred thousand jobs deficit just in Alabama fry 'em [noise] now a lot of people are under the impression and and they couldn't be more wrong a lot of people under under the impression\nA skilled trades workers are you know oh he's not smart tell them to go into the trades or oh he\nUm he didn't work hard to go on a traitor oh he uh\nGosh I Can't I Can't think of I mean right you hear a lot of Iraq and it's not going to college to take them tell them to drag Zachary ... gives you an act of dinner is that he's not cut out a cholera epidemic on the trays\nOr or or even you know oh no he's going to trade is never gonna make much money the reality is over you know twenty five year period most of the time they make more money than college graduate\nOr they have to be smarter frankly because they're they're working on the job and split second things that matter that are that are fast paced and you can't stop and always look everything up\nA but what what can Alabama do you're going to the state legislature what what what can what are some things Alabama can do just to make that hundred thousand\n... job gap that we already know is going to exist much less if we keep bringing businesses in\nSo I think one thing that we could do is we could kind of take note Colorado State is doing an apprentice program there are several other states had thank Tennessee is one if I'm not mistaken Texas is one I Believe they're doing these apprenticeship programs are taken a a girls and boys who eighth ninth grade\nWho maybe they don't they're not into the whole book scene but they they can take an engine apart and put it back together or they have a knack for some type of crafts something that I really enjoy doing and they're they're starting to do a print is programs where the where they go in and they have an apprenticeship at school so it's it's a it's a little higher\nThan trade school you know you can go in and then\nYou have businesses and industry that partner with the schools that that work through these ... apprentice program so that when they graduate from high school\nThey're done they're printing shipped over and they are ready to walk straight into that job that manufacturing or that how long is Colorado in and blows it gets two years and years now so they've got to say that you can see but there's been some legislators legislate tours that have traveled out to Colorado\nAnd view their process and what they're doing and they were just traveled out there and so [laughter]\nI mean he was all you can get it\nDoes it get hot [laughter]\nBut\nYou don't know I probably won't get that guy went to Colorado He gets high he gets he gets I he doesn't he when he does our on our trip and I think I think I'm In New Mexico [laughter] so I got all kinds of weird stuff that we could\nWe we take some high school students are sixteen and in like we had three of them that workforce all summer and uh and so we started develop and you know them a and that there were some are higher there a big help and they learned a little bit about the foreign next year you know if they want to come back and workforce there more than welcome to and\nI think we need to capitalize own students that that don't have a desire to college because there's thirty five year olds on the farm industry making a hundred and sixty to two hundred thousand dollars a year and I know a lot of people who have master's degrees and they're not going down a whole thirty right now right yeah you know so we we've place is\nA big emphasis on college in in my whole thing is you know I graduated from ... university I think college is great it has its place but\nA teacher comes out making forty five forty thousand forty five thousand dollar ...\nAnd the first year in Alabama I got a hundred thousand dollars in student had say student loans that and you start adding it up I mean I tell you from or why student debt that hundred thousand dollars in student debt painted our dollars a month and I don't think she is yeah and uh July it does in the\n... most of the middle class right before you try to the middle class you have to pay the toll and that is an exorbitant student loan debt that we can get in later to why that is but uh the ever increasing desire for the higher education to continue to eat up more and more money\nOut of a out of the pockets of hardworking Americans want to get ahead or\nI think it's a great discussion you know every legislator need to have a passion they need to be known for something\nUm [noise] and you'll you'll figure it out in the first couple or three years what you want to be known for it but this was that this was a this is a real tragedy coming down to buy it is in Alabama and if it is going to hold us back we don't solve it will be back well diseases in the studio he's gonna be the representative house district eighty eight after he ... and the children were elections\n... the thing is ...\n... ... ... ... ...\n... we have

convulsions\nAnd the latest over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court has resulted in the wrenching public and private testimony of women who have been sexually assaulted and it never full before spoken out about it\nOf course this outpouring has a hash tag ... believes survivors women who tell their stories should have the support and belief of loved ones friends and a therapeutic community\nBut when a woman and telling her story makes an allegation against a specific man a different set of obligations kick in\nThe we must hear out the accused fairly and respectfully and recognize the potential lifetime consequences that such an allegation can bring it believing the woman is the beginning in the end of the search for truth than we have left the realm of justice for religion as a sampling\nOf that piece right there and let me tell you this is a dynamite a dynamite pays I'm a posted to Facebook without comment I'm not going to\nNot going to put a combination away on there just so you'll have it and if you want to look at it but I'm disappointed apiece like that even has to be written in the United states in the you're twenty eight team\nThis country's been founded for two hundred plus years\nYou would think in a country that has Fourth Amendment protections Fifth Amendment protections sixth amendment protections a country that's\nBased on fairness and and everything else that you wouldn't have to have a piece telling people oh well you should also here with the accused believes right like the navy we should you know maybe you should hear from the other side before forming a judgment hope and what disappointed me more what I did not get this on the Atlantic website I got it on another website\nAnd it was a liberal website and it was posted to the liberal website as an example of bad journalism and bad messaging that's going to destroy the left if people keep this up really yes it was essentially posted as they can you believe someone has the nerve to say this in this environment\nAs if the defeat of justice Brett Kavanaugh is so important\nThat you cannot listen to the rights and the stories of the accused in America until Brett Kavanaugh was defeated you cannot take the time to hear what somebody accused of doing something wrong has to say about it\nAnd it's disappointing to me I I really did not believe we were quite there that when even when people got out of control that somebody in an esteem publication like the Atlantic I mean it is a steamed points out that will you guys may need to slow down a little bit this sounds a little more like a religion than a search for truth\nYou're just believe somebody outright because they happen to be a certain gender or have are alleging has certain experience you automatically believe them and you automatically disbelieve the other person\nI don't know\nEspecially someone you don't even know right I've heard more people ascribe ill and and and positive motives both ill and good motives to these people Brett Kavanaugh and lousy for to end the the the ... the woman who allege that she went to ten gang right parties and didn't tell anybody about it\nAnd kept showing up the parties you know yeah that's what I Do you know whenever anything like heinous as going on I'm like I really want to read and I want to go back and hang out with the same dude that were you know danger yes Neal angering being bailed us out I could get an Amtrak ticket [noise] ah it's like I\nJokingly said jokingly that true it's true I've never seen heroine right right but you know I'm so weirded out by heroin if I ever saw heroin probably wouldn't be hanging out with whoever showed it to me again because again as I've said on this air there is no good story that starts out with\nWomen the heroin paying an age [laughter] no so that they brought up the CNN means you're hanging out with bad ... bad generally speaking stay away from heroin you know somebody breaks out of joint\nIt's not gonna offend me I'm not gonna lie of ... I'm probably going to try to stay in in a way to live as on boy a but if somebody breaks out heroin Mm I'm not going to necessarily call the cops\nBut I'm sure as hell is going to get out of their right and I'm sure as hell not going to be around when the cop show of the time of year yeah hey honey is getting late and then all of you know what I'm not going to do that next friday\nWere those dudes were you know shooting up the house fun I'll say is that with crew and relaxing and but it doesn't\nReally late at this point guys if I go out to a social function some party it's supposed to be people having a good time you know and all of his job I'd rather have somebody pullout heroin than talk about the Kavanaugh hearings\nAh [noise] yeah probably I'm leaving either way [laughter]\nGood lord I'm leaving either way at least that there's somebody there to get to know I uh but but but again if if that's your react I think that's most normal people's reaction if somebody goes on heroin they're yeah they're like the hell was All right it's time to go is getting late you know I enjoyed it or how much more someone you know there's a gang rape taking place in the next\nRoom [laughter] I mean how much more having cracking heroin you sort of have a a play on their own they don't have the glamour of math right [laughter] right\nNone of these things are things that I Would normally liked interact with it but anyway I or that that's the problem at this great pays encourage you to read I read it cover to cover\nA I don't agree with every word in it that's not why post stuff to social media is not what I talk about stuff on line but her closing line I think it's just remarkable does the legitimacy and credibility of our institutions are rapidly eroding\nIt is a difficult and brave thing for victims of sexual violence to step forward and exercise their right to see justice when they do we should make sure our system honors justices most basic principles\nFor those words this woman is getting absolutely annihilated on the left a ... for daring to say maybe\nWe should hear what the other person has\nShe and here's also the thing of you know getting annihilated and I believe you in fact I I think I've seen some of the commentary on that\nPiece from the Atlantic good Lennox great folks read it\nAnd it only it as degree it's usually intelligent I disagree with it Ninety percent of the time I read it almost does is idea whether it's like somebody says something bad like Roseanne who's hopped up on pills some crazy herself for what our ... making we're America great again hat along with the ... sweatshirt and everybody goes no people that are geared and destroy\nLike no they're not you know it's cold I post something and then I put my phone down and I go about my day like if they want to actually have an angry mob actually shows up at my house that's one thing\nBut it people yelling at me on line and fighting on my post NATO gives a damn [noise] you know I Know that the Atlantic quality publication because they've called me at least twice well vetted how we how do you think I\nFound the Atlantic day that you were you were burning trap\nTrashed possible you know [laughter] and I thought it was like what does this things in there [laughter] on the top and that a good looking beard [laughter] our number two seven to nine two to eight eleven minutes to the top of the oh I can to shave my beer tonight\nWhy are going to go into the Tony Blair thing I figured I said I Am a\nI don't want to show up at a what a prime minister can handle beard uh\nI mean he can but he's Alabama yeah here's what I'm worried about\nWhen I take it down I'm going to have like a a\n'cause I had it all summer [laughter] I'm I'm worried if there's a there's going to be some\nOr and I guess I'll see you next Thursday Joey Dave I'll see you in to Thursday's maybe he has probably ...\nFortunately I'm proud of you for Clinton ... tough yeah I'm not as angry as was yesterday they really didn't I never got angry necessarily but it was that it was like I Can't really opened my eyes all the way feel\nI hate that and you can't Murray's like deeply\nI feel more energized soy really yeah but [noise]\nOn edge though are better\nIt's happening the caffeine actually makes it worse to be honest with them but I Need to uh [noise]\nIt makes the withdrawal quarter stars can chewing gum people asked us to do things don't forget about the ... century some gum it just looks like we're almost out of gum [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nRiverside Chevrolet Master control center this is W.

draw a conclusion where we are right now is what's gonna happen the next two years so\nThey're going to do the Democrats because everything they can fight everything that's being done by the Republicans in Basra and if I'm if Kavanaugh is confirmed and everything\nThat's just kind of fire them up even more we have two Republicans especially conservative Republicans we have to continue to step or to buy because if you slack off at all they're going to overtake ... they're never going to back down there are going to back off there are a cohesive group\nLike I don't keep fighting and we have any fracture in the way back in eighty one way\nThey just got to take over and they will tell you\nUse your interests in common you know we have a couple of other things that could be going on between now and uh the election\nOne is Grassley who's actually call for an investigation into the testimony of forward and has sent letters to the attorney about where did you do with the letters that we gave you did you tell your client that but then there's also this boyfriend affidavit this out there\nAnd looking at the possibility of line before Congress that then you have the inspector general's report was a department of justice that could happen after having a boat\nAnd it you know it's so sticky and how do you go wow\nI'm investigating or ... or looking into someone like Dr ward off the minute that you eat unsafe some and\nYou know the left automatically she was going to come down on you and just do everything they can about how are you are and it's not I'm Out of them say well when they find the truth is the matter than how dare you even think it's just not true so\nUm it's ... it can be done but I can tell you what I see is the Democrats are just going to cruise to buy it\nYeah you should open the victims at all it's all going to be on ethanol over data so it's got to be sticky but you know what needs to be done and I hope Grassley does have the gumption to say you know I'll tell you push the issue then we're going to go forward on this side of the Cornell\nWell would you do is until you have them pay a political price for this and you keep you keep it going then they're going to keep doing it now than they are going to pay a political parties and then a political prices are going to be a Republican is keeping the house and gaining gaining so huge in in the Senate which\nThey're going to out a Ford in the region they need help poor because if you if you show Ford lied made it a\nTest you learn about the polygraph knew something about how to overcome upon grab her boyfriend said that he did an affidavit that credible to me but if they will get that out there and get it nailed down\nThen the only person who criticize Kevin now with her and she was

the good find Christian universities\nOr they could they just haven't decided to pick one from there\nI'm just I I you know it just gets much suspicions up a little bit why that source you know\n'cause I mean if you if you backtrack a lot of the people that have made it up to the top of the pyramid then that's their source that's where they came from that for the they were groomed\nProcess they owe draw from those two pools and I'll just have a it's a big question mark from me for that too but anyway you have a good idea and keep keep up the good work then\nBut really go to Rodney Rodney with more than ... show when it's a receipt sums up there should\nPay a higher than I Am doing who are you by the way that the day and I'm pretty confident that you know all this stuff the uh thing coming back that everything is falling apart for Democrats a pretty confident of that one day last week um Thursday I left ...\nAnd I've traveled in the best the best of times with my friends down there or left Alabama as cautious with some friends family here in Alabama and my neighborhood some neighbors and so forth and the stupidest thing\nFollowed by antibodies yeah I Know or Saturday and Sunday\nSame thing back with some friends of the family and longtime friend turned them different thing just having family conversations with a lot of the family now the\nMid term me what's going to be in my opinion that the Democrats\nWere going to have a part of ... ... per se but\nIt seems like with the cabin on things if we took the\nBig big turned the Democrats the fate of the big ... ... I mean you know ... and ... and the direction they want us to do things to me not only that the the male is the number in America of think of it being a accused the tax\nPolicy portable and everything else\nBut it seems to me also the women in America across the board the taxpayer is totally disgusted when\nI'm On his ... family man can be attacked and destroyed liked it I think the Democrats have been calculated\nThat the American women and men do not paying the on anyone who would do something with pain this this is Paul has tried to attack a woman or attack or a rape a woman or do something about that Spanish or for the other direction\nBut when you attack the man in this country and you pack them in the way that they did an innocent man to finally get the backlash from not only the males females monopolies in terms of our reflexes Democrats have faded Bree Bree\nError yeah same thing as a voter reaches how we open to show up and they said they reach some the Kevin Oh and civil suits is coming back to Republicans or suburban women women\nAnd that was the group said particularly independents a that was the group said the Democrats were actually doing well with it and because\nWere kind of winning away from Trump no there's kind of were first is that kind of one person has been burst\nToo because when I got both from the women though of the ones that off off spoke to is that they look at him as being a very respectful family man and\nOutrageous that disgusted as some of them to cooperate with the ... what's that all the votes are going to make sure they there but we'll see you on the term\nIf that number shows up on the other side but I think it will I think that it is the silent majority of the women out there\nThat are looking at the same you know watch this this is a serious situation and the Democrats went the wrong way with it and talked to a ... on on this man and the American women are going to temple off at the polls\nWell here's the other part of that equation and that is the\nIs what states there and you know kind of foreign you're you're not going to really change an awful lot Missouri and McCaskill coming up so early and say she's going to vote against cabinet now and then because of the accusations that were there\nNot the ... accusations as soon as we have a bad backlash um McCaskill him places like a high camp in North Dakota\nAgree with that [noise] All right well if I Want her to the bar to hear more about this or that I'm old I'm though will be in the mid term but we\nAppreciate the phone call writing\n\nThis um get into how the um the Democrats are going to hell and there's some questions questions over the scope of the FBI inquiry into Kevin I'm\nChairing committee's top Democrat that Senator Dianne Feinstein says\nNot interviewing Brett Kavanaugh for Christine Blasey Ford quote raises serious concerns that this is not a credible investigation and that's a question what are the restrictions has a White House place on the FBI definitely gauges outside FBI Headquarters in Washington Jeff good morning team do you think that we're satisfied with this report today [noise]\nNews this case was with them right in the middle of a political firestorm and that's exactly where they are six days after this supplemental background investigation began this was not a criminal pro were the FBI could just follow leaves wherever they may go in this case the white\nHouse sets the parameters on who the interview and what to look into the Dr Ford was not interviewed Moore was judge Kavanaugh FBI agents relied on their public testimony from last week's hearing to track down witnesses ultimately about seven people were interviewed as the FBI try to corroborate the allegations\nWants to pro was completed summaries of those interviews were turned over the White House in\nIn Korea like this the FBI\nCome to conclusions that's up to the White House and this morning the wall Street Journal is reporting that the White House found no support for the allegations but we're just gonna have to say what's the senators saying one\nThat reports now [noise] and I mentioned the show today is it important that they they tell you that they didn't do Kevin I'm forward and\nThe other part of the equation just to the White House to tell them not to do have an hour or Ford and because the last thing that Trump said was that\nAdvantage investigated whoever they want to investigate need to investigate is up to them just had to report done by friday\nOr is there a memo for McGahn to the FBI limiting people to a certain group it started out with four and then the F beyond a expanding up to ten but the question will be and I said as soon as it's gonna be problematic\nYesterday if the White House said don't do it that can be a problem I don't think it's going to stop him from investigating because I think you've got to know testimony from both of them to do it but um\nI think is um that's that is a story if they decided to to not do that it was them completely\nThen have added dating game one if the\nHouse made that decision then that would be something else the other little thing this out there is that there's all these people who said I've got an information own cabinet and the FBI didn't follow up with him I personally believe they're just trying to flood zone with those type of inquiries to make it last longer\nThey should take a couple of them just to go and interview 'em does it say how many and become a negative whose own any one bill coming back to you have

said that any sci pro that doesn't include an interview with Dr Ford cannot be called an investigation and they say they are full profoundly disappointed Republicans\nArgue that Ford had her say when she testified on Capitol Hill last week\nSay they added ... something wrong so listen again oh let's go to another one let's go to Peter Alexander on this and don't know about the FBI investigation this morning that FBI\nInvestigation is in the hands of the set at the White House overnight announcing but FBI agents had completed their work and at the FBI had sent the findings to the hill a source briefed on the findings is forwarding tells me the FBI contacted a total of ten people and interviewed nine of them into the White House concluded\nThose interviews did not corroborate sexual misconduct allegations against Brett\nKavanaugh all of it as Democrats and lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who was not interviewed by the FBI complain the investigation simply did not go far enough [noise]\nThis morning members of the Senate expected to get their first look at the FBI is completed background\nInvestigation into judge Brett Kavanaugh\nEveryone has asked saying how am I going to react I have no idea trades and fairness I have no idea\nLate Wednesday top Republican Mitch McConnell starting the clock on Kavanaugh's confirmation vote boiling or even receiving the FBI spine light beer\nThere'll be plenty of calm for members review and be briefed on the supplemental material\nThe top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein blasting the White House for not instructing the FBI to interview Kavanaugh himself and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford raising quote serious concerns that this is not a credible investigation Cabot all his vehemently denied all allegations of sexual misconduct against him\nFor his legal team also question goes ... any FBI investigation that didn't interview her or witnesses she says corroborate her testimony releasing a statement overnight that reads in part\nWe are profoundly disappointed that after the tremendous sacrifice she made in coming forward those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth\nNot interested in seeking issues was there's some things that\nBurden went to an said during the congressional hearings that the FBI would have uncovered because it sounds like the lawyers and dark for withholding information they were waiting on the FBI or\nThat it is is known as soon as that goes there was something that that she did not share with Congress and she was over there but yeah that would indict Kevin or because she withheld information and that's just a bad\nIs this is just in and tell you I Hope they get to the bottom of this because they really if there was a political motivation and catch the female attorney and doing the um the ...\nThat if if that was staged and and we do confirmed that the story that the second doors where the door to a window unit that they added on to their house to glue Google employees\nThen the hope is just going to change its just waited know ready and she was passionate and the only thing that said that they put a down in

beginning with me and the president pointing out actually\nSeemed to me that he was dating back to the doctor for herself a laid out in her testimony aren't So Peter the FBI you said interview just ten people for this investigation why\nYeah that's right they reached out that then they only interviewed nine and over the last week you remember there have been complaints from Democrats and some Republicans at that point President Trump gave the FBI the green light to interview some people beyond what was an initial list of just bored potential witnesses but at that point the FBI interviewed\nJust five others and current and former FBI visual till NBC News dozens of other people had come forward saying they had information on Capitol but the sources say agents had not been permitted to talk to many of them among the people were getting the FBI did not interview here judge Kavanaugh and Dr ...\nC I ended up back into it I Believe they were one of the news um that's where the ... but does own but twenty twenty four people out there\nAnd you'd have to get a much in every ... every one of them are going to go do a thorough investigation and I think that'd be out so the

your show up [laughter] we're tired of it\nAnd he's going over all the things that they require democratic continue with a friend towns and then when we went on this or not needing to interview for to Kevin known as she can outspoken about this\nWhy didn't they interview Kevin on board and well prizes by that\nI Am I look I don't I personally don't believe as a prosecutor that you couldn't have a credible and complete investigation without an interview of Dr Ford\nNow I think what you're going to hear from the FBI is that they were constrained in who they can talk to buy the scope of the investigation but even if you take that on face value that they were constrained to investigate\nThe allegations of sexual assault that still doesn't explain why don't interview Dr Ford thing they already have her testimony and they already have his testimony is that fair\nWell that is fair but what does what and not get out of that well and you don't get out of that the therapist notes which you could have asked her for permission to get and don't get the polygraph or the polygraph record what you could have asked her for and so there are a lot of good\nReasons in a thorough investigation as a prosecutor I think I Would have ... agents back out to do that as it hurt the FBI's credibility to I think it does look everybody called for this because they were an independent third party they were the gold standard in terms of an investigation nonpartisan and\nTo have them now say we found no support for doc Ford's allegations but we didn't speak to her I think does undermine their credit but our background\nChecks investigations are they ... well they're inquiries right and you were here quite\nMight anywhere on the expectation that all of a sudden that this was going to exonerate someone or condoned someone someone was wrong from the beginning they gather information that's right and they had no subpoena power they can't compel anyone to test it to be interviewed by them\nAnd I do think we have to be you know from the beginning I said you know what are we expected the FBI this allegation is thirty six years old they're unlikely I thought from the beginning to be able to corroborate and\nUm they you know they also have this proven that\n\nYou enjoy it again yes and it looks like from here I can get a little\n... one one was or should we should sing similar [laughter]

investigation\nNone of us have said that have judge Kavanaugh dead what he's been accused of doing by some of the Democrats and outside people some outside people should be disqualified but after investigations votes the committee [noise] and the FBI [noise]\nWe have found nothing absolutely nothing to cooperate accusations against him [noise]\nAnd we need to confirm him right away this confirmation would be a victory for the Senate as an institution a reminder that the politics of baseless personal destruction\nI think he's one of the best nominees I've seen in my forty two years in the United States Senate [noise]\nThat's how I judge to him for the way he's been treated [noise] this is an important position yes and Democrats have a right to do very worried and upset about about ... a Republican and getting the street because they thought they had won the election\nBut that isn't the case\nIn our side to handle this I think with discretion\nHounding every problem that has come up [noise]\nAnd frankly I Hope we can just move forward and get this done it's the right thing to do judge Kavanaugh's grudge semi retired justice on the United States Supreme court I intend to

well and also that this is just the different ways you can a skin a cat\nWho I don't know why you would that's a weird thing I Would do a lot of them yeah we have a lot of what you're saying a lot of weird sayings no I was listening to a pod cast the other night ... guys who grew up in the south ... and they're like well I didn't realize that saying a girl with was a racist\nAnd I was like oh really I'm I'm sitting there wondering what's he going to say hey I'm about to say it but em you hurt you know calling people ... and they'll let you in on that\nEverybody's insulting each other these days especially when it comes to a partisan politics and Kavanaugh saying it's really heightened to um people to get really getting at it and don't get me started on the battle of the sexes men women which are\nNot now now this this is my thing Kevin office on his way to becoming the next Monica Lewinsky he is he oh his name is going to be synonymous\nYeah and that's just like now everybody's asking about these ... and then\nIt could be the Vatican that could be some aristocracy in England with their king could be the Chinese emperors or the Russians ours or even the emperor's in Africa or the demolition\nFeuding tribes error or the the people in the pre sacrificing people and Mayan civilization dessert I mean there's all sorts of crazy crap\nWhere people were like we're the ones in power and we're going to use violence I don't like those people I think that should not very much inherently corrupt\nWell I'll put it seemed like this that is human nature the week I mean the strong always dominate the week\nWhile I wouldn't I wouldn't disagree that there's um there's some corrupt aspect of human nature you know the strong can\nBut but do do you want to do and I do you do you want to know where you see this most of the parents like when I was in elementary school I had a best friend you know I mean how much coal we played together every day and stuff then one day he becomes a hall monitor\nNo no that little bit of cloud our little bit about that\nBy next week he was he was like a mafia boss hey where are you going to go to mass do you want to pass by whoa okay so that's what we're doing that but but just that little little lane ... imagine getting the bats that says you literally can do what you want\nRight well and here I don't want to get back to the point to a guy came out with with the the money is imagine there isn't any money like you're saying a barter system yes\nIt takes somebody actually working to raise the chickens or raise cows or milk from the cows or form and harvest whatever crops you were building up a you have to do something productive at some point\nThat the other people one yes\nAnd I love that idea of course and that's all money all money is and should be ideally is a shorthand for that\nLike we have created value in some way and by created value other people find a valuable I might you know have sentimental value for something here but we're talking about economic value like oh well people are willing to\n... well you you you think about this raid for it you think about this back back in those days and it sounds a little barbaric but it's true used to be able to literally by your wife like okay I've got a cat or I can get rid of four of them okay yeah I guess what tomorrow you'll have less well yeah\nI was down you know round like okay that was he was like\nMy ... women's valuable here man you better get me a few cows ... yeah gave gave up for\nMy daughter [laughter] right\nNow and trading has been going on for a while but ideally all money is is just a short hand to make that process of trading valuable things value for value more ... that that's what it used to be but you figure now but now there are people that think oh no the value comes from the money itself\nAnd that's why they just keep printing more yeah and I think a former theft oh of course of course I'm In the books I haven't been right on the United states government and use Ryan\nThan every other governments piling up behind that using the u._s. dollars kind of that pegged as a reserve I think it's gonna be it's going to be a glorious disaster and for some future I mean I'm not hoping for it\nI was getting ready to start because the fall of two thousand eight prove that regular Americans are not ready to be broke 'cause see I Would have let it just happened this is what I mean like people are all worried about what was going to have I Want to just let it\nHappen well you know reasonable banks needs to be bailed out no oh\nCredit say you got hired here two days ago mental your second day you come in pay Joey the banks are failing or there was a disaster in New Orleans so the insurance companies are closing up ... oh and the auto industry needs a bailout to\nYou know and we need to find this terrorists Osama bin Laden go\nI Would say well I'm not exactly I mean we can go find the terrorists but are banks can fail because they were being stupid and the auto industry can fail because they're being stupid been over leveraging themselves and many other ways\nWe can take care of the people who are really suffering we need to take care of the people in the areas affected by you know hurricanes and natural disaster sure there's nothing wrong with that yeah we can kill people that Neal kills us but as for\nThe government being the backstop for all sorts of vice and bad behavior\nNo no well you must you failed serve thing you have a good day oh my goodness you would get no no we let them fail\n... well this is my thing the government is the fallback for everybody who cannot govern themselves and that's how it was built up\nBut if you try to govern yourself you know\nThe government will come after you break your legs and give you a\nCar [laughter] no no no but they will\nBut say back back in the days people weren't govern themselves but you had corrupt people in certain areas that will take advantage so the governments that things like you know what we're all going to be under this one banner and we're all going to listen to this one person that's in power or\nWas it the the corrupt people realize the best way to control things is to have a government\nAnd fund it yeah yeah yeah basically taking people's stuff\nGoes goes a lot of people don't know that they do\nI mean I'm tired of politics corrupt my money\n[noise] you can't have one without the ... I think you can you can yeah us history has proved otherwise I don't think it's proven anything of sorts\nI mean ... explain any dollar actually I think signifies a particular amount of a silver\nOkay and that you had standards of money brought up I mean of course governments existed in this world but the idea was that a given amount of silver is giving amount of silver give them out of goals and given amount of gold\nThe government can say well exchange or notes for a certain amount but not when you're dealing with the gold gold silver silver and the market's going to Barrow is going to bear on it\nAnd so that money and institutions backup that money lend out that money\nThey can exist without the government taking over those things\nI I think the way it works a lot of these top bankers and find that top people in these financial institutions there the main ones who back a lot of these candidates yeah and it's it's for that reason it's like okay just keep your nose out of what we're doing over here\nWhen you keep doing what you're doing well some of it yes I agree a lot of it is\nI Want to simplify this that say the government still issuing money okay and it's not a ... I'm but I'm tired of politics corrupting our money still my monitor here because say you do make a lot of money like you provide a service that people like oh like even on a radio yeah\nProduct well it's more service would I Do I I'm more tell people about things and hopefully entertain them with my nonsense okay but and I wouldn't do well to barter economy\nWhat you want to hear me ... for an hour serve for one of your chickens [noise]\nYeah and I guess storytellers that exist in the past of course but\nOkay and you become even more and more successful where you are influential on the culture imagine if you are in fact like Google and you didn't take any government money from the beginning that's not actually how it worked but\nSay here's some corporation and you started up you found success you didn't take any government money you are completely independent and you refuse to go lobby in DC you just tell them how much do I have to pay you\nLike what's the general tax alright leave me alone they won't they won't let you do that of course not because they'll get you and something else oh you lied they who are they oh the politicians politicians but also your competitors\nAnd here's the whole point and this is why I mean I'm tired of my politics corrupted my money when you give the government\nSo much power to manipulate and nudge in control people in almost every aspect of their lives what's gonna happen is the people that have all the money didn't want the money will go ... instead of providing a great product or service at the lowest possible cost the most efficiency that will help people still do by that\nI can make money by going to the government and can controlling my competitors\nAnd it makes sense because\nAnd then the other way of
