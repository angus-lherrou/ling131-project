is the ... the something is really bad or should we say there in the Bible they have these are where the ... the prophet his were bad profit the words for that you know\nSo we have a lot of bad profits out there are that are trying to control\nWhere they they come up with a prophecy that as their best interests at heart I Know I mean they they're telling you something to to get something from you that's right it gets you to do something given money right I mean how many of these things will come on TV so he just sent in money and everything that I Know there's there's one on now\nAnd

serve Andrea and I think they budgeted out of and ask you for like I don't know about\nTwenty cents a day or something for the month right and you're saying that at the end of the ... because everybody loves children well yeah and you are animals that to get\nThing now may I add these people get when they lose their money in the stock market are all one K. cuts in half ... managing the frustration\nYou think of machines going to get it you know how many folks is going to get into the next two or three years when this thing probably happens I don't know what I look all I Know is that I've been reading a lot of stuff ... and\nThey can't be that many a ... ... ... ... so many um coming on saying well I predicted two thousand one predicted two thousand and eight I acted this have predicted that\nAnd when you hear those people say the next one's going to be worse and it's right around the corner I'm going where no I Wish some people would listen to me ...\nWell you know as you were saying uh there was a um [noise] what was her name is a psychic from she's back in the fifties and sixties and they said in a book I read about her so she predicted a John F. Kennedy assassination route\nAnd among wanting you pick up a phone call them up and say look don't go down and something will happen don't you do it and of course my favorite\nNoticed her dumps\nOh yeah I have a good one does give her yeah they've been taking his stuff for a thousand years ago yeah well maybe five or six hundred years right and and you are a lot of it's real\nWhat he wants in Hayward around five hundred years ago I think he was five hundred years ago and ah what's ah Italy or Spain where he came from a ... it was a batter France\nBut okay maybe it was transmitted via Fran ... he wrote these are ... trains and I have a a interpreted them they foretold the world Trade Center that we are now you know I suppose but the thing is\nAfter that happened they said oh that's what this myth yeah is backwards or addicts yeah like the what do you call it the the uh the construction deconstruct thrive what about the one with Hitler in there and they called in history I remember that\nHis daughter ah he will be the dark one who rises and all this kind of ... there's some things you say that made it sound like a mini and all of this and if you want to hear more about that ... has got those records you need to seek guile\nSaid ... [laughter] I like to work that when they when I can that's just funny [laughter] the thing\nIs people can say well you know we said this and we said that and we said this and then they look back so I'm sure you should listen to this but the thing is what's so frustrating is when people know the history repeats itself over and over the stock market goes up and down up and down as it's going is north\nAs the economy grows the market goes up yeah but it has some really deep holes it falls in sometimes and sometimes it falls in the ... and he stays in them for a long time or maybe don't\nBut the thing is when you don't have a long time to wait for them to come out of the whole ... it's just like when you know you watch they use a prison movies and they put them in these uh holds for lack of gosh knows how long they stay in the hole and you know there oh man\nI mean you're punishing an old man mhm or an old woman and by the time they come out it's not really been too good for all day I'll Wait\nSo if you fall in the hole with your four one K. if you fall in the ... the whole would our re any sit the wrong time of the day of your life\nWhat good is it what good is it that the stock market will come back why thing is it if you're bad for ten or Twenty years even what good is it what good did it do you just say well on\nTwenty years or ten years or five years I'll be back to where it was your hope or I'll be better off well I have a question of a legitimate question All right ... I'm In the stock market got a lot of money and they're doing pretty good right you might even say I was\nWell off ... and I know that the stock market is going on at some point turn\nWell it always they always do it that's why I Know it because I've I've got got experience with it being ... okay now is there anything I can do to shore up things so that when it goes\nBad I'm OK absolutely what is it David\nIt's called putting your eggs in a secure Basque uh-huh putting your eggs somewhere that when the stock market goes up you go up some uh maybe a lot\nLike I said this the return came in on this this particular program that I'm Talking about ... I had one that came in or just a few weeks ago it was about eight percent return but she made it ... percent bonus\nSo she made twenty percent return last year so now it's like about this ... I don't I don't know\nIf she had a hundred thousand dollars twenty percent of that is twenty thousand so she's a twenty grand a year right which I ain't bad no I mean she might have had she might have had ten thousand that's correct so that would be two thousand print still you you still have made money on your money right\nAnd and I'm not saying that you're going to make this kind of money it's just that's what it might that's what it made ... if the stock market goes up these things make more money if it goes down they lose is no money\nNow if you're in the stock market goes down you lose money\nIf you're using these kind of programs the stock market goes down you lose no money because these are ... um about government these are insurance companies ... that have these programs and they're guaranteeing the principal and the guaranteeing the interest is still called interest when he goes back in it's not called growth\nIs called interests and the reason why it's\nA decent program is because it's it it's really designed for the people who've already made their do to some extent mhm if you're a young person you shouldn't be doing this you should be going in the four oh one K. and I can help you with that okay\nAh there's insurance programs can go into for one case okay uh what you want to be more aggressive but if you as you get older you want to you want to be less aggressive and more protection\nIn other words you want to protect what you've already got there's no sense and making a lot of money or having a retirement and then you lose it\nRight at the ... time that you needed mhm if the stock market wasn't so crazy right and how which I guess it's crazy all the time but if you go back in time and you see these times like what if you in Nineteen twenty nine had\nMillion dollars in your portfolio yeah and he was in the wrong stuff ... and you are sixty or sixty five years old or it might be a fifty fifty five years away no matter who's wanting or you're screwed yes a whole decade of the thirties mhm\nWas pretty bad I was reading um a lot of people don't live as we had two recessions in the thirties\nNineteen twenty nine was not the recession that was the great depression yeah which wasn't a very very rarely\nTwenty nine was the stock market crash and the depression didn't come along until like Nineteen thirty three or four and then they hit again in Nineteen thirty so I have a lot of people like why I thought it was Nineteen twenty nine nope that's ...\nThat's when he started it went to the decade up and Dan crazy stuff nobody even got anywhere until after World War two there really wasn't any that's what pulled us out okay another words\nThe economy started roaring again stock market started roller and again and we had the I Will call it they said the roaring twenties now we had the ruined fifty mhm the fifties where everybody had a car and everybody at our house and everybody had two kids and everybody had food and never had it was great 'cause we're making good money\nDo you ever think about maybe if we had a depression and we can get with this country that you know to work with us and we declared war but we went over there and where we didn't really fight we just kind of hung out and we had to have stuff 'cause we're over there and so people would go back to work\n... you understand what you do you think that would work out because you know ... or will you know well we could use the money to you know ...\nBook [laughter]\nI mean this without killing anybody ever it'd be nice we I mean we could have one of those computer war games or something yeah yeah computer war game\nThe thing is that that really geared up the United states though is the geared up all those factories they geared up all that stuff mhm they're making stuff to supply the songwriters yeah but in this day and era and this is what I'm reading a mob not saying anything that's not out there that you can read it's\nNot like that so much we came back out of this last down thing that happened back in two thousand and eight ten years stock markets up three hundred percent ... from the bottom yeah like about that three hundred percent you're going yeah man it's great I Want to stay right there\nIf something goes up three hundred percent in ten years is it going to go up another hundred percent or three hundred percent in the next five ten years\nI don't feel warm and fuzzy about you but as you often see it you don't ever know\nYou don't know you don't know you don't know but you do know you went up three hundred percent so if you have gone up three hundred percent we elect elect some people say when you when you're out there and it's in the casino and you're a gambling real hard ... make a big winning you should quit right there oh yeah\nThat's me if I really want to keep putting your money back in the casino right lack\nLab because there and believe it or not they are not in the business of giving money away right by that and how they make their money back and they they do make a lot and they can afford to give it away at some point but not everybody is walking out of there like in the cartoons holding two sacks money with little money sounds all I'm a lot of folks walking out there broke\n... what a skin is I Know what it is that my\nWell basically the skip is is a room that's a soundproof or you can't hear you can hear in as you walk and they can't carry in the cell phone ... watch or anything like that you can sit there and read it it's totally a lead enclosed room so nothing kind of trade said considering they're read the recent report\nNot make a copy of it I don't know if they're going to allow him to make no it's I don't know how they're going to stop that and\nUm and then they can leave that for the next person to review but this is it's just a matter of time before something like that leaks out bottom line is\nHow many and abused and you have to do aren't as many takes their late this past the election watched\nIt looks like they're out of cards so the the current coming down on this don't you don't even get that sense there's no there's no more delays are going to vote on this this weekend\nI think that there should not be any more delays you do the best you can do and the bottom line is the only thing that the that the Democratic side of the house really wants to hear is how many more interviews you can come up with people day after day after day that have something negative to\nAllegedly offer and only to the way of looking at a a vote I think this is a ... it's going to be voter run I Believe by the end of the week [noise]\nThe um [noise] the complaint is that they did not\nLooking to judge Kavanaugh's drinking when he was in college and law school or high school that that wasn't adequately investigate it and the supplemental what was your response to that bear\nOut and they know that if they haven't read and how do they know what's in supplemental you know they they don't know what questions are asked to who was interviewed they might very well have interviewed a couple of guys at the church has some beers with\nWho said yeah I had beers with them and nothing ever happened to you know they don't know that they just sent my thing that they just want to keep the pot stir it up in order to the continued that the alleged doubt\nA contrived out I look at it is by those are the ... 'cause\nWe have an update on here that Bill Bill a question for you Ronan Farrow in the New Yorkers are reporting that or the FBI probe ignored testimonies from former classmates have Kevin all these are people that went to Yale with him\nAnd uh they ... the ... they're trying to Ronan Farrow claims that these are primary eyewitnesses are witnesses to the Deborah Ramirez allegations the problem is as you read into this story you realize these are all here say witnesses who claim somebody told them that somebody told them that this happened\nSo it wasn't the FBI pro those people are they just seen as not credible witnesses\nProbably not credible witnesses and and bottom line first of all\nThis if they're if they're not I witnesses to that\nThey're not permitted on the stand in a court of law that ... mind are doing this and you have to make that cut off some plays into what is you know calm and what does it make sense to do and\nNone of these people make sense and if anybody can come up with some sort of a story I heard from a friend of a friend that doesn't that doesn't carry any weight with anybody [noise] mhm\nWell again people think that the FBI is conducting some global investigation into any allegation no matter how remote\nAnd interviewing people on a hearsay basis where people have just hearsay recollections of things that happen Thirty years ago it makes sense\nIt makes no sense or another is not happening I think the problem that exists here are the bureau is going to get sucked in the eye one way or the other if it comes out the way it appears that's going to come out the the the the the Democratic side of the houses are going to say they're all from Trump eons from the bureau\nIf it if for instance something comes out that that does give everybody a pause and ... and it's credible uh then you know there was going to take a black guy from the other side of that was I I just think it's a it's a very tough way to go but it's an investigation that was demanded and done and let's get the vote [noise]\nWell I think again in the end people want to have people\nHave faith in our our institutions of government especially like the FBI and\nYou you don't want to believe that the FBI is acting in a political manner ever and I think that the media do an enormous disservice went on an issue like this with no you know with with no corroborating contemporary contemporaneous witnesses\nTo expect field agents or the FBI to be doing these types of\nA broad ranging ... brought us this kind of broad ranging slew thing into the background of some and this is not what the what the FBI does and people don't either get that or the media has been so remiss\nIn not reporting properly what the rules the FBI is but you did you see the ignorance it's the willful ignorance of the media and then the the poor people who don't know any better\nOr who don't have time to delve into these issues I'm like wait why are they keeping the secret outrageous this shouldn't be sacred this is our Supreme Court you know that's going to happen\nOf course it's going to happen we write is a combination of everything that you should or ... bottom line is these some of these people\nTruly don't believe um that there's anything going on it's wrong here it's because they support they have to say well I Believe that uh\nThat the judge Kavanaugh is guilty who can't look at the facts and come out with that conclusion but they do\nHave an here on the lower income show bell thanks so much for spending some time with the former

James\nEarl right when it thirty seconds are coming out Mark Penn uh he's going to give us a snapshot unaware the mid term election cycle is and I'm going to ask him whether the Democrat\nPlayed this game way too long of delay and whether they really they just overplay their hand it's overplay their hand here and extreme do they look too extreme for the American people\nNow and how will that

those bags and puffing is you'll see them diminished as well\nIn fact the nomination should be confirmed and that included eighty six percent of Republicans Democrats or do you\nLook Democrats even after there's no ... sixty percent of Democrats [noise] you know would oppose the nomination but you see that sort of the center\nOf the country says hey if I could see\nThat there is no cooperation I'm going to be fair here I'm not going to ruin this guy's life on the basis of two people who testified who I think are fair if there is no cooperation and that's certified by the FBI\nThe Atlantic has a piece out um here's why white women are abandoning the geo pay a\nNew evidence suggests that many of the women may now agree uh and they were made some joke about Tina Fey um who took\nWhite women to task after the Trump election who helped him get elected providing him with fifty two percent of their support\nFaye Faye focused her remarks on college educated white women forty four percent home of them voted for Trump saying chastising them for wanting to go back to watching HGTV and forget about the election you\nUh it looks like some women are taking that to heart a morning console political poll found that President Trump net support among Republican women had dropped by Nineteen points [noise]\nOh that's a huge drop if that's if that translates into people voting for the Democratic party that could be a disaster for the geo pay\nBut I think that is the the biggest\nBoth changed in the electorate concern for the Republicans and victory points for the Democrats so far which is that the cause of what I always say the closet conservatives in the country are actually\nIndependent suburban women [noise] who voted twenty points for Romney's who voted probably Thirteen fourteen points for ah for for President Trump\nA and they've been up for grabs I think the Democrats than making very good kind of momentum with them I don't think\nThis Kavanaugh nomination never help that I always thought that a woman nominated who even a woman nominees for what might have been more conservative would actually have been the right strategic choice here I think the Republicans have held on to the working class voters Trump talk\nBut those are the voters are up for grabs and I don't see anything coming out of the Republicans to women back\nYeah well the again you would think the economy which is of course on fire women care about prosperity and security and all those issues that Trump is focused on 'em but nevertheless at twenty September twenty six us the LA Times poll\nCounted twenty per ... percent point advantage for Democrats among all women a twenty eight percent advantage among married white college educated woman women a group along tied to the G O P the Republicans now lead by only five points they had a much bigger\nA much bigger lead among that group of women before but now those are low as well um is is is this is a substantial block\nOr the married\nCollege educated women and that's a substantial block but among all women I mean I\nI think a lot of this might be tone and Trump's tone women like things calm they like things to be calm down and I think that they they sense that things are chaotic and they seem to be blaming the Republicans for that maybe this stuff for the last couple of weeks might change that I don't know [noise]\nBut they're also more skeptical about the economic progress if you look men are like wow this economy is through the roof\nWomen who as you rightly pointed out typically are even more concerned about the economy and its effect on them and their family or less understanding of an improved economy and that's another area\nWhere the Republicans have really failed to drive their message what every day every day that the the national question is is she\nRapists or not\nIs the day that openings focusing on the economy I mean you've seen the last day or two incredible jobs numbers ... come out and the focus is primarily you know on the cabinet on issue and it's going to stay that way at least through you know middle of next week probably\nYeah and that's um I think that's why I'm Mitch McConnell wants this vote to happen as soon as possible this is what my barnacles said this morning on MSNBC let's listen\nLot of Republicans have come home and the state of Florida and the Gillum racing was comfortably ahead you can go to other states and so\nAgain the races are tightening in do you think that they perhaps Donald Trump is the data that shows that this is driving conservative and conservative voting base back home of course the the Joe ... is exactly to Donald Trump strength the one thing he\nIn this case white male or is that white male resentment um I think the white privilege discussion is driving even more men now to the Republican Party I think people are really getting tired of this identity politics I'm Mark I I think that that Democrats have gone way too far in a [noise]\nAs you do a for a long time I I've been against of class warfare and the density politics\nAs a as a moderate Democrat you know I've always been against those two in favor of kind of the right kind of you know social policies and balance I think what's really happening here is that\nThe Democrats were completely energized they were looking for an opportunity to vote against Trump and the Republicans without a leader without a particular message we're incredibly disorganized and I do think this thing\nHas awakened the Republican base you know in a in a way that is backfiring on the Democrats unfortunately\nUh I think they still have an edge but I think they probably could have had to wipe out the way this thing was heading and and now I think you're going to see a kind of a balance among turn out here because the stakes of this election have been just raised you know so high now\nYeah and I I Do think that again he see what the Republicans are capable of when they stand United with the exception of the three I'm more liberal Republicans who\nAre are dragging their feet on the on the nomination or the party when it's United it's pretty formidable I mean even a bunch of older white guy pretty formidable ... never seen Mitch McConnell so [noise]\nYou know it's so good as he's been in the last week just as a political matter\nBut see that's ironic thing\nIs particularly see this in the Senate races and I think you see a lot of the Senate race has\nTightened up because the Republicans are coming home and there's no question that this Kevin ... is a highly partisan ice wrote and if you're in a state where the floated forty orange for Trump you know there's no question that it's going to be a large percentage more way above a majority that would want to see you confirm it's in the Senate this has\nDone a lot I think the Republicans you know in the house you know not so much you know Ryan quit\nHis job and I didn't leave there's no leadership there is no message where where McConnell or as you say has stepped up maybe some people think we're leaving some people you know what I think too harshly but as you said you stepped up you've got the message leading in the house there's nothing\nYeah I Know there has to run or less it's her on her list and it said Paul Ryan should have left if he's going to retire should've left to let this thing can be taken over by somebody wants to fight for these issues Paul Ryan's basically not even a factor right now a Mark Penn thank you so much for joining us that's always great to talk to you on radio and on the angle will take a break\nEight five five forty Laura do you believe that this ah the politics of rage that we're seeing right now I think it people said Trump was embodied the politics of rage uh but now it seems like the Democrats have taken on that role at least during this cabin I issue\nHow does that translate in November are you voting have you vote for some people have already voted voting early encouraging others to vote or you got to spread the good news if you believe in going forward in this economy and you believe in his basic principle of fairness in ... as mark said if you really shy away from my identity politics\nAnd political correctness used as a cudgel to silence people you've got to vote got to get out there and

my child was in danger if I thought there was a predator [noise] ah that my ex was marrying or I thought uh some real extreme thing then I'm going to cause the baby step when we're going to take care

small business and I'm Around land fear my wife uncle had a had a sign up for what's called a caveman insurance policy\nNow I'm a little ignorant to as to what it is going to be that it the contract my wife event benefits here but in the event that anything happened to me she kind of get my portion of the business but it also worked as a retirement fund the type of thing that I'm kind of calling to see what\nWhat your opinion is of that type of policy and if it's necessary or or what I what I should do\n... came in is what it's doing it's not a type of policy so separate the two things I mean I sold you a piece of crap called a whole live life insurance policy because it has ... okay has a built in savings program\nOkay so we're we're going to cancel the stupid policy I kill millions simply means it's typically used in in a situation like you're in in business uh by cell agreement\nAnd the way it would work is that um you you said you're in business with who your brother\nYou're my brother ... and so uh let's say you died the life insurance on you would go to\nI your share of the business from your wife\nOkay\nBecause he doesn't want to be a partner with your wife\nOr not because he ate your wife maybe because you're white but not because he had your wife but more like that because she didn't want to be in the business right so it ... them the money and they do it in reverse as well he needs to buy a policy on him that goes to you but it's state in in the\nPartnership have the same thing we're both okay so you're both going to cancel this for ... for about ... piece of crap yeah you're going to\nBuy term life insurance little do the same thing for about a nickel on the dollar for what you're paying now okay what's the face of milder that's what's the face

credit because I never kind of went and looked and kind of a\nPaid any attention and this is the second time about two and a half years ago kind of the same thing and I kind of laid out a budget and then kind of slipped away from that budget and I think it was it just kind of rolled back into it I filmed everything was going okay but it just kind of wasn't\nOkay so you gave her a all of the responsibility of handling the money and you weren't involved in the money\nA hundred percent okay yeah yeah it is your fault you know I'm\nAn editor fault or but basically she was out of control

where do you get that fire from was it desperation\n[laughter] yeah I think it was um mostly that living with a student loan was unacceptable for us and and we just had made the decision and our heart that um we weren't going to do that and so I had and we had just individuals that kind of\nHow the perspective that I'm living with a student loan was um you know it was normal you know it was just a mediocrity and that was just a part of life\nAnd Sally money's going to be a room mate for life\nBy God though people you know are some responses that we got where like you know you don't need to do that\nOr you know that you can get this into your life that we had just made the decision like you know art student loan was just so astronomical that we couldn't live with it and they'll and we weren't really when you were ready and willing to do and tell them to do this zero budget you know there's Iraq's and budget everything out and every dollar hadn't assignment\nAnd every extra dollar

people changing behaviors is called boundaries by Dr Henry Cloud\nI read it many many years ago and since then Henry and I had become really good friends I Love Henry\nI Love that book too\nAnd one of the things I grass from reading that book and other books is this\nThere is a difference between forgiveness and reconciliation\nThose of us that are wise in emotional maturity spiritual maturity\nAnd those of us that are Christians are called to forgive when you forgive you set yourself free\nFrom the bondage of the fence you're offended and when you forgive when you're a victim and you forgive you're not setting the victimize or free you're setting you yourself free\nYou can forgive someone and not be reconciled to them\nThan lady called a minute ago and was trying to figure out how to\nShould she reconnect with their brother in law she's having trouble reconnecting her brother in law after he had affairs and everything else\nAnd he supposedly come clean for the last two years\nHis wife has forgiven him and taking him back and been reconciled to him but\nNot the sister in law she didn't wanna be around it\nSo here's the question at what point for someone's misdeeds do you forgive them and then at what point are you reconciled to them they're different\nGuy\nSomeone rapes you what a horrible grotesque violent unbelievably violent crime I Can't imagine can't imagine going to say something like that\n\nBut to not forgive them of eventually as you begin to heal from your emotional scars\nTo not say yourself free from that very difficult to do I'm not saying it's easy but when you when you do for give them your set them free but you would not be reconciled\nMeaning you wouldn't go on a date with him you know someone steals your wallet\nYou can forgive them but you're not gonna you know leave your wallet with them later your new wallet for them to watch over your money you wouldn't be reconciled with them probably ever in that situation\nBut in the case of that young woman she was not personally wrong her\n\nYou know the guy's wife is who was wrong right and uh her sister in law was wrong to her brother in law I don't know how it worked out his brother in law but anyway as it was ... I guess her husband's family as a way I understood it but anyway the the lady that do the wife is who was wrong to\nShe forgave animals reconciled to the husband as he supposedly is putting his life back together I mean there are people that live together I don't know the guy\nAnd you don't know the guy well once you knew that you can always do well you know\nPeople that I haven't done it can always do it you know any one of you listening is capable of adulterers affairs\n\nEveryone's capable of that and if you think you're not capable of it you're just about to have one I mean really that's just ridiculous so at what point do you forgive someone when they've done something wrong at a distance\nLike that\nI can forgive him and you know I Hope he's turned it around and I'm not gonna sit around and ring my hands and be mad at him and worried about him\nI Hope he's turned it around hope he doesn't hurt her again on his wife I'm I can I can do that now at what point am I going to trust this guy again that's what reconciliation is at what point am I going to trust that his conversion his turnaround Israel\nSaid we run into this all the time with their coaching because uh one spouse lies to the other one about money what we call financial infidelity\nYour husband your wife lied to you and ran up a bunch of credit cards and you didn't even know it it's hard to trust them again after that\nAnd if you're going to stay married you're pretty well instantaneously gonna have to sit down and go okay I forgive you but\nI'm not necessarily going to be reconciled to you financially I'm a I'm going to watch over your shoulder on everything that's going on or we have a couple of come in and the guy is a ... is a you know he he's a been found to be a gambling addict which happens like every week\n\nFootball betting is destroy anything yeah family's finances its own be livable\nSo he comes and he's discovered she's discovered he's a abetting addict an online betting addict the gambling addict and now he's gotten treatment he's in gamblers anonymous any seeing is pastor and he's seeing a a counselor and he's doing everything he supposed to do does that mean she just turns over the checkbook to him and let him go run havoc again no\nNo it's a matter of fact we recommend that when someone's recovering from an addiction like that that that they not have control of and not have any access to money for a while\nUntil trust us rebuild over time but ten years later ... should be rebuilt ten months later it shouldn't be better than it is now two years later or should we better than that it should per aggressively rebuild trust\nAnd so if ten years later you you're still or you know you have not bet on a football game again you've not lost any money gambling again or you trustworthy at that point yeah as much as anybody else's and so we're not going to treat you like you have no ability to handle money the rest of your life\nFrom Utah you prove that you can have a little bit absolutely but then gradually trust his rebuilt and overtime is rebuilt if you cannot when someone has\n\nOn something like we're talking about here has\n... has not when when someone has demonstrated over an extended period of time that they're not entering into the negative behavior and you can't forgive them and you can't begin to trust them in that area then it starts to be on you\nAnd two years clean if the guy's clean from his double life adult for survivors or whatever he was doing on addiction whatever it was sound like it was all about\nTwo years is a long time you should be some level of trust rebuilt assuming it's all real now if there's indicators is not real still looks like he's sneaking around if he's still\nGot behaviors that make everybody question whether there's a real then that's different but I'm assuming Scott straight and if he's great for two years and\nYou know it starts to be your problem if you can't begin to trust at that point especially given that his wife are already ... she might just be in a neighbor she might be [noise]\nShe might be ... and that could be what's going on\nCould be that he's cleaned up is alive and you're just suffered you can't forgive\nSay that's the difference there's a difference in forgiveness\nReconciliation they generally happen at different times\nForgiveness should come faster than reconciliation\nPet a dog and I try to make\nI got to be reconciled with\nThis is the day Ramsey [laughter] [noise]\n[noise] I get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where\nYou are and your baby steps it's a necessity\nNot a choice as includes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace a stay at home parent responsibilities I only recommend term life insurance sense is the most affordable way to get the right amount of coverage and not break your budget go to ...\nYeah I Would I'd walk you dreamed it up to him [laughter] well done you guys very well dot that's good that's good you're going to add to that James or is that just to intimidating to follow a yeah I mean what do you got to say after that it's all [laughter] very good [laughter]\nCool cool what was the hardest part\nSo the hardest part for me to do was telling her kids know um you know our kids were in the age range that ten to sixteen\nAnd we were doing everything they I mean we had a good income I mean our kids were taken lessons for sports we had him doing clarinet lessons and flew lessons\nAnd fish and I sat down with our kids right after ... when we bought that home study kid and we told them what we said guys your mom and dad is screwed up and we've made some really\nBad decisions and because of that you're going to suffer and we're going to suffer and that's the only way we're going to get out of it and we got to make make that decision and so we made the decision that\nYou know you either got to take the pain of discipline or you've got to take the pain of regret and we had to pay a regret for so many years and we said we're done with that\nAnd we want the pain and discipline and so we had to tell her kids um had to tell my son or not doing basketball training anymore so we've got a hoop out in the backyard lets me and you go back here and all of them will train together right\nAnd that was hard I'm In the same thing with my family we had to tell our extend my extended family that we can't go on that family reunion that we\nHad said we're going to go to because titian I agreed we're not going to go and do anything we're not taking vacation we're not doing anything until we're at a dead\nYeah and that was the hard part for me it was

culture built around that and I think that's pretty extraordinary um they also make use of plant medicines or\nWas good for you or\nSomething that they use for big visions so if they want to anticipate what the whole group should do Twenty years from now they'll use the ... in a collective ritual and that includes little kids you know seniors everybody in the whole sort of community participate\nNews urged Murray and choose makes you more aware of the possibility of God or does it take you the other way\n[noise] I guess it's a matter of definition how do we define God I think that the idea that there is something beyond this limited awareness this encapsulated mind body that connects us to other mind bodies or suggest something vast\nAnd I also think you know people who are able to access these non ordinary states of consciousness experience depths of reality that aren't part of our mundane everyday experience and that's you know pretty mind altering\nOh really the supernatural and the spiritual reincarnation and things like gun you brought some great stories about reincarnation of the books that you roll back in two thousand Fifteen ... makes life possible told me about the title again how did you come up with\nWell I like to say I did but I was working in partnership with Deepak Chopra for a film we made a feature length documentary by that title and he was the one that\nI was giving a lecture at one of his workshops and I was showing a little video that I had done with some of the scientists who are working in this area of\nYou know after death reincarnation\nAnd he pulled me aside after I was done is like\nMadeline let's make a movie and I thought well wouldn't want to make a movie with Deepak Chopra\nAnd then I went to bed that night and I woke up the next morning completely petrified you know the whole idea of having to fundraise and all the rest of it and so at lunch I think Tim very profusely and explained that it really wasn't going to be able to do it and he said oh Marilyn stop worrying about the money the money will come\nAnd I'd like to say it was just that easy but uh we did accomplish something that now has been all over the world translated into multiple languages and aired on Oprah about two years ago so it's been out there and making 'em an impact with people who are struggling our\nIn both the film and the book was to help transform that fear that people have into an inspiration for really living well\nI mean I was told people I'm not in a hurry to leave but I'm not scared if we have to do it\nRight and we will eventually although the world that's a whole interesting thing to in terms of future science you know we see now that all of this cloning is happening they've just cloned um eggs that can be fertilized to turn into humans in a petri dish it's\nCrazy it's amazing it's it's truly spectacular\nAnd learn how to download memory and push your ... and then cold and your body and then put your memory into the body we live forever\nYeah that may be how we get life on Mars or future beyond that is that it's going to come with you know some kind of genetic manipulation and cloning and\nYou know it may not be that this physical body goes out into space but that it's generations later through these kind of scientific interventions that we start to see the future of humanity\nWhat'd you say to people Marilyn who say hogwash life after death does not continue when we die that's it it's ... what are you saying\nWell I'm very respectful that people have various different perspectives different world views and my inclination is to think that what we really believe\nIs probably what we're gonna end up and uh so those people who believe in reincarnation may well reincarnate and those people who believe in sort of the Buddhist journey of an lightened meant um may end up through in and you know maybe in a black hole somewhere you know alternating at the\nThe threshold of some event horizon I mean I think all of those things that seemed completely far fetched in the past are now something that we can really start to grapple with\nWhen I made the film I interviewed a Michael ... who is he's just loses a skeptic the well known skeptic he's also you know a really smart guy very interesting and and I use a nice guy yeah I Would say\nAnd what was fascinating there were two things first of all I he acknowledged that when his mom died he heard her voice\nAnd I you know with a little surprised that he was telling me this on film and I said well really lets you know go back to that and he said oh well you know it was really nothing but yeah I heard her voice\nAnd I thought was interesting acknowledgement and he had a good psychological justification that was just some kind of hitting the gods ... experience right at that threshold of sleep and dreaming\nBut it was interesting that he acknowledged it and then the second thing that I I really loved was that um he got married shortly after my interviewing him and I guess they got married in either his house or his\nUh now White House and her father grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her a radio\nAnd uh it didn't work\nAnd Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually in frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer and didn't think about it anymore and then months later\nThey were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing\nAnd they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in and followed the music and it was that radio and his wife was quite convinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one Michael wrote a column in Scientific American where he\nStarted to play with the idea that maybe this was something more\nAnd his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of entrenched position of skepticism\nOn what's important too is a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was the dogma tests were the people who really understood anew and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of these things but they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than uh the bunker\nI think so too and it's a ... I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism as the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulses\nYou got to Marilyn stay with us we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work\nIn our final our next hour and we'll take phone calls about this but I also want you when we come back to talk about this\nStory reincarnation of on a little child but was born with three ... marks the we'll talk about that it's an amazing story so many more Dr Merrill

one four or five\n[noise]\n\nWe will take your calls next hour with Dr Merrill Lynch ... makes life possible also consciousness and healing as well and the Marilyn would you tell us the story of the reincarnation of the little child\nWell there's so many stories um this one had to step birth march or something like\nWell Stevenson was a very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong in chest and trying to document cases of reincarnation and he collected about a thousand case studies of young children\nWho had had a some experience in the past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical report\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark [noise] uh so it's not a typical mall but some kind of unusual birth mark\nAnd it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nUh for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village\nOr in Asia and he um [noise] in Stevens and then went and investigated the biography of this person that the child remembered being\nAnd it turns out that that person was shot through the chest in the same place entry and exit um where the bullet ostensibly went through the body\nAnd so that becomes a kind of biological sources evidence for reincarnation and these young people you know it's not absolutely evidence but or evidence all but it's still compelling\nIn our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had founded and he tells the story of a young boy who uh you know very early just about the time he learned to speak\nRemembered being his grandfather and he would tell his dad when his dad was changing his diapers a I used to change your diapers\n\nAnd it was kind of shocking for these parents and other sure and\nThen this kid's started remembering other things about the kind of car that he used to drive and so is a little test the ah parents got a bunch of pictures from the dad and the first of all they had a class picture when he was in elementary school\nAnd so this would be the child grandfather and they asked him to pick out which one was him and he had no problem finding himself in the line up and\nThen uh they were going through some of the other snapshots and he saw his car and he said that's my car that's my car I used to drive a car and so again it's not\nDefinitive evidence that there is a kind of um survival of consciousness or identity after ... death but these instances give us really compelling ideas about what is possible\nIt's truly remarkable and remember the study of the little boy who claimed that he was a World War two pilots and the new things about the plane landed too hard the tires would blow up and really nobody knew the other than the crew and the pilot\nAnd he was telling his parents ... like in the ... and ah they took him to a reunion or a World War two veterans and uh she she she knew several of the people from his unit it was an amazing story you remember the case\nI'm I'm vaguely remembering it I don't remember the details of it but I think you're right these things are phenomenally intriguing and it's very exciting I Know that the University of Virginia right now is hiring a post doc\nTo work part time with them and part time at the Monroe Institute to do some psycho physiological research on this\nUh we're right now setting up a lab here at Sophia to look at the cycle man's him on this was a a technique that was used by the ancient or colds and greed and say I'm a sensibly were able to identify and communicate with spirits\nBy looking at are gazing upon a reflective surface and Raymond Moody developed this protocol where he put people in a darkened room put a mirror on the wall illuminated the mirror and such a way that you couldn't see her own reflection but\nPeople start to see things and hear things inexperienced things and uh you know there have been a number of experiments looking at\nPeople's ability to make contact with their departed loved ones and have those kind of conversations that they never had a chance to have and it has been shown to be extremely useful for a brief moment counseling\nSo people have an opportunity to have the conversation they can see it they can see there's the spirits and so what we're doing now is bringing that idea\nInto a virtual reality environment so we'll have people sitting with the virtual reality goggles uh looking at a mirror in a sensory deprivation procedure and we're going to record and try to understand what it is that people are experiencing when they enter that state\nOne of her very special guests author researcher Rosemarie Ellen ... uses black mirror to do a lot of this\nNational I didn't actually really strange uh-huh what do I would be interested in talking to her yeah\nYeah just to do with the charm if you were the marijuana and you'll get you in touch with her or her website is visionary living dot com you might be more emailers straight through there\nOkay but what you're saying even that title for website is really not so much about what happens after but\nHow those ideas and belief inform how we live now and you know we know that people\nBelieve different things even within a common culture a all we have to do is look at the political debate that's happening right now to know that people justify their beliefs based on different kinds of evidence and while in our culture we tend to\nUm hold in esteem the idea of rationed rationality about reason about the idea of objectivity we we make appeals that if we have good objective data that that then is the evidence that's going to shape our beliefs\nBut what we see is that it's most often something else it's most often a\nPersonal direct experience something emotional or transformative and that's what really shaped our belief and then we just rationalize the rest of it in the name of objective data\nAbsolutely or special guest Dr ... we're talking about really things dealing with consciousness and the other side how many people who believe in a life after death also believe in God what do you think the percentage Maryland\n[noise] I think it's a tricky question I'm of course when when when\nThat about you and George I'm I think that it really depends on what people believe going into it and what they defined God to be\nFor example in um the Christian tradition there can be a lot of fear of you know the afterlife because it can be met with you know I'm\n... and if you if does involved of course right hell and damnation ...\nCan be very very scary whereas if you're coming from a Buddhist tradition where there isn't on God per se but there's this idea of you know consciousness as the ground of all being so in a certain sense consciousness become God a that can be a much more\nUm [noise] a beautiful journey toward something that allows us a sense of safety and hope optimism\nDoes that shape what our culture tells us is true can very much influence how we think about the afterlife and how we hold our relationship to the divine\nFor a diverse portfolio including document capture and storage Taj in your paper by process as a software tremendous cost calmly

read the other side George\nWhen my husband passed away six years ago he was on non believer\nIt was a good Christian but doesn't believe in spirit and thanks okay I haven't been listening to you know all of the programs from way back when I was on his wife and you yes\nAnd I had this experience and I don't know who tell them to some time now my husband of course who was a non believer\nAfter he passed away about just three days\nUm but before this happened on the service burial service on then he'll just says he was going down into the ground you\nKnow form came up view was wild win and everything it just happened so fast and then it stopped it took only a few minutes it was very odd you know as we were leaving the cemetery\nMy son and the oldest one said mom when we were getting into the car to go home dad came home with us while I says what do you mean\nHe got in the car also\nBecause they could just smell him the call was filled with his body odor and my husband was very nice person but she had this sense about him he wasn't a smoker nothing but here comes my son said that [noise] and I just the school\nBut then a few nights [laughter] always sleeping and my left foot still bothering me from now and then we had a serious I'm not a skill later and um\nI was on and say no\nI followed my foot going up in the air and they was my husband at the end of the bed lifting my left foot\nWhile you can clearly see him\nOh beautiful yes yes he he always wore a white T shirt but it'd be neck and short attention on and he passed away before he couldn't hit Ninety four\nSo far Egypt pretty good Romo was when it\nAll he wasn't perfect specimen that doctors always says what do you do for you that he was Seventeen year old man and he's Ninety three is a little\nI said nothing he does it all the exercises and walk and he watches his diet my husband never had a wrinkle on him but George this is the thing he pulled my leg up and\nAnd I sit com that my ... and he says I Want you to take care of this sport you see the doctor can and he dropped it and that was it it was very upset that I wasn't they can ruin the doctor after that\nYes I hadn't been ... the thing is George Martin logo so came to visit him I mean you know he was a non believers does like to do\nNeighbor churchgoers good Christian part a sense but they even taught Sunday school is a dumpster in but the thing is\nHe told me after seven years this happened he says Alice mother came to visit me and says when when we lived on them young woman to the streets but I says why\nDidn't you tell me about this and when you are you telling me he said I didn't want to tell you\nIs I said well was it all about what she stood out the animal are bad and and he got up and he he was standing at the end of the bed and mom what what is it you know and she says well Tom I Want to know how our isn't doing because I was six months pregnant when she\nPassed away when she was concerned home I was doing he passed away much first he was only fifty for\nSomething to how old are you know I'm not for Ninety four good for you\nAnd um the thing is George I haven't been wind qualities several times because we listen to you every night my son and I and he's a believer now like you\nKnow if it wasn't a believer five days ago but he's been listening to you both rent and he has changed and full of wonderful he believes in life and so he's not afraid of passing on dislike base but I have no\nOther children in law did not believe it was just go to church all the\nTime but they don't believe\nThey don't believe in the afterlife but the thing is George I had been having just first attack when I was seven years old I was going I Love to be a Catholic but I'm not Catholic I'm everything as my dad says just you know\nHow would you what were you raised I when we were raised as just from a hot he said you're churches right here right in your heart you know no no no\nYou have to go to searching church never my dad was my dad was a Roman Catholic my grandma Nelson who is also and they were the Catholic there was ... much he became a part of this and\nAnd um and then they decided not to be in in his late seventies he wanted to become a ferocious\nDishes I said dad what happened he says because the British people don't they don't seem to be fighting all the time was\nWhen you read the Bible you know it's always fighting on George you know the Bible I I have read the Bible to into my law school and everything but the thing is this happened to me when I was seven\nYears old because my two girlfriends for Catholics they went to the Sacred Heart church and um\nWell when I was in the Catholic so I went to go with them seven o'clock mess on Sundays and I wouldn't have breakfast too because she is going to confession and I didn't\nGetting dark confession done and I was sitting there at the Pew [noise] and I tell you about\nYour passion I cashed out my next sale on the back of the you know yeah I my breathing was cut off\nThese you know you could have died I yeah\nI well that's what I meant ages\nI mean this is something that is you know and even the priest when it came to get me to them they thought I was gonna\nUm you've been through a lot less me when I went to grow as well right yeah and they came up to me when he came back they said\nOh\nAnd you know what there's already a stretch and and you'll be hiding him you know when George I had never seen anything so beautiful my life and we never had color t._v. or you know we had was read us back into thirty\nHorse in those days that's all you can search\nAnd I tell you what I got it all and all is that when I hear your call call in to say they they ... they had been up and came back I find it very difficult to believe someone story because my visit with stuff like that I Know what it looks like\nWhat is yours was a good visit was beautiful George and gee\nHuh I Love it hey we're going to take a quick break in a moment Marilyn that was a great call Ninety four years old\nSo inspiring Alice thank you and also one of the things a couple of things one is\nA lot of people do feel lonely when they have these experiences because our culture isn't more supportive\nAnd so I think what else is saying is um it really helps to have programs like yours where people can hear from others and know that they're not you know isolated they're not crazy they had these experiences and there's something to it\nAnd there's no doubt about that Marilyn we're gonna come back and take final phone calls with you in just a

my colleagues are ... others at the Institute of no ethics sciences torn looking at\nThe possibility that when a medium is getting information that is accurate\nAs compared to when it's inaccurate there may be measurable differences in the brain and in fact that's what they found it was a preliminary study but it shows that when people evaluated\nThe statement made by the medium as having been accurate or correct\nThat the ... the memory center of the brain kind of cleared out\nIt was as though the brains of these medium for creating a space for another set of memories to come in I find that extremely provocative and interesting so yeah I think there's\nThere's all kinds of mysteries in this world and science will only beginning to approximate some of these experiences that people have\nVery routine and you spent most of his life chasing down mediums wanting to try to communicate with his mother the ...\nWell I think there's been a lot of fraud there's been a lot in this direction and that doesn't mean\nAnd are wrong or inaccurate so you know again it's how do we know what we know and what is the basis of formulating our beliefs are convictions and are they right or not you know it's often we get stuck in places that aren't necessarily the best path forward\nBack to the phones now we go George in Corpus Christi Texas one of those George Europe\nOh you're oh you're still with like the little the callers call him a higher consciousness or\n... or humanities they're sitting because of all or you know are we going that we are going to be the only savior\nOr everything that we do and um the lady before a bottle and she said though it was a book or in a strong believer in it is just so hard on the soul ... pills what the soul to do and the soul moves on\nAnd I want to hear her say about that and I think you do it so much I Love the show\nBut to joy and scientists are beginning to think the heart is much more than a poll Maryland\nAnd the guts I mean we know that we have multiple sources of intelligence in our bodies and I think that's extremely interesting I don't know and the answer to the question I we evolving toward a higher consciousness or\nAre we evolving toward greater levels of complexity in technology but I'm more reality and our ethics haven't really changed that much I've been watching\nA show on the ... cheese and we know that you know they were\nCatalytic to the time of the renaissance and promoting our ten language and science but at the same time there was enormous corruption and you know people poisoning other people to get them out of the way or you know really creating false narratives about people talk about false news\nUm fake news you know it's been happening and I think people have manage their\nInability to resolve different points of view through violence and I'm not seeing right now that there's a whole lot of\nAlternative higher level um meaning centered altruistic kinds of principles that are certainly being communicated in the popular media by our political leaders I'm just not seeing a lot of\nUh references to a hopeful message for our own evolution toward something higher if we want to use that metaphor and it doesn't mean I'm not helpful because I also see that there is tremendous good in the world and often times we just need to shine the light on that I think\nEventually good beach over evil don't you\nI sure hope so I mean I think if we have an option of what to believe that's a good one to believe in\nYou sound a little ... that I'm a little um skittish\nI'm a little skeptical of how much we can simply just say yes everything's gonna be fine you know I'm just not sure that that's really where the story goes I think each of us in our life can make choices and do we want to\nAh grab hold of our highest potential do we want to develop our social and emotional intelligence you know those things take effort and if not people can just\nResort

I. F. edition\nI'm\nMissing here when we wanted to go\nGrassley Grassley has some intuitions to to say on Fox and friends he does not do many of these have interviews I cut out at the very beginning when you're talking about the boat because I already knew we would already know the boat um and so just like that but he said we talking about the Dems\nWhen you look at it as the Democrats are lined up almost in unison outside mansion and saying that this is a sham a dumb and end is used as an expletive saying it's all be asked despite the thousand pages and the multiple uh interviews are you surprised\nThat the people that demanded one week for an evaluation last week by saying it's not enough this week\nNot only that but the during our last hearing they said we we we ought to be having the FBI look at one person only one person ended up looking at about ... people but they needed a look at this guy that his last name is Dr\nThey aren't satisfied there already is moving the goalposts but I think you've got to go back to July the town\nHe's going to do anything under the sun\nTo defeat this nomination [noise]\nI've been trying to have a fair answer all an open hearing and I think we have done exactly that uh to get everything off\nI've been dealing with a demolition derby on the part of the uh Democrats or where they've been out to do everything they came to defeat him and\nOf the things you think that they'd be concentrating on is he qualified to be on the court uh twelve years on the DC circuit court a three hundred and seven or decisions one is er about this person that he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court no his qualifications\nHave not been an issue everything that I've been an issue is secondary thing\nSo you remember had a beta Mitch McConnell dug in about having to do everything I can to make a bomb a one term president ...\nNow so he says that the Democrats went crazy they went absolutely nuts but Schumer saying they should hear anything you really don't have any of the year actually very little even putting the media on this will you do have Mitch McConnell will get blown up and the media I'm\nOn the on the whole subject but Grassley was pretty good with that he Grassley is kept at the process and he's an old timer and here and he's seen a lot of water to go under the bridge and\nI think he's kind of camp tobacco even here soon here from Lindsey Graham who is likely to be the successor to a Grassley will will be those who goes to a to gradually and be tune that committee so this continue wound is gonna be talking about West is gonna be talking about the visit stone\nOr what do you think about these protests are that are attacking our colleagues and elevators that Orrin Hatch and Jeff Flake\nI think that it's a reflection of the\nInstability of American society generally\nI think it's also\nAh people will go to any lengths one they're encouraged by people on Capitol Hill like a one a congresswoman saying\nA resume roots go up and another senator saying get in their face we as senators ought to be setting examples for civility not encouraging is civility you heard about the resistance since November\nTwenty sixteen you're seeing the resistance headquarters right here on Capitol Hill\nAny of your democratic colleagues admit at any privately if you say we've gone too far the heat is up to high just never happened to Atlanta Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor and the higher in the hallways what is it about this\nDon't forget there are some people on the right to get hurt overly a\nA vicious as well are we here on Capitol Hill\nTo set an example for civility\nYou do have to say the sample forest ... but then again in another sad particularly with it as [noise]\nMe too movement and I I don't know if you guys are saying the video but there jamming the host particularly the Hart building which is kind of open atrium are in there and they're down to the bottom floor and just going crazy\nAnd terrorizing the senators and what they'll do is they go down to the basement and take the train him over to the capital so then I Walk into the Capitol complex\nAnd um and these are just like everywhere I mean there I didn't even know you could get in the tunnel as a civilian but they're down in the town where you go and pick up the trend\nSo let me continue on with Grassley and I'm\nHere and he's going to say something interesting and we just wouldn't want you to listen for\nHe's going to say that in the the way to say that the investigators document for the interview that they did with the ten people know that they actually talked to some of the interviewees said that the Democrats were trying to pressure them into changing their statement\nNow that's incredible and that should be looked into this isn't in\nChairman we understand the legal in Kaiser the former friend of Dr Ford feels ... felt pressure\nTo revisit her denial and uh of knowing about the alleged assault back in tenth grade and you feel about her saying that she feels pressured by Democrats to change her story\nThere is evidence I Can't speak about it because of a sudden the FBI report but there's evidence about other people that have been questions that they were led into it as well so this is another example of headquarters for the resistance right here on Capitol Hill\nAnd you do believe that there's a problem with the dead broke ... doctor forwards collaboration with the Democratic party what paper work do you want to see that you haven't seen yet what do you see in terms of the communication\nPolygraph other things that that she talked about to the Washington Post if she can talk to a Washington Post about in show to talk to us but let's get back to the legitimacy of foreign coming forward if she was she was a solid I Believe she was a solid\nThere is no cooperation\nJudgment that it was a judge Kavanaugh\nYou gotta take sexual assault\nAccusations very seriously we don't do that\nSociety and this uh\nUh uh whether a Ford is right about judge Kavanaugh\nBringing to the people's attention the major social problem we have about ... sexual assault and we don't talk\nIs at least one good accomplish by Dr Ford coming forward and even though she wanted anonymity and even though Senator Feinstein\nOther Democrats on the committee or didn't protect her\nNow that was important so they basically said end up doing in the um the ... that you cannot see that it said in there that when they interviewed some of these witnesses that they were getting pressured by Democrats to change their testimony\nSo in other words they're being asked to lie where when it gets down to there'll be a national I hate to tell you something but that's\nDo they need to find out who was it that did that and does it say it in the Rio too that are being tightly held his own any rippling one than most show will be back\nQuite a bit\nOf your news ... ...\n... ... only won W ac\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]

a negative effect for Democrats who was the opposite of that in other words or is it fair to complete than people think well that's doing so we don't have to worry about that so it was not as important to elect a Republican so here I don't think that it's going to be the case\nI don't think that's going to be the case I think is the case here is that\nPeople was that they do need Republicans\nMore Republicans on there to make sure that Trump programs and Trump policy towards getting carried out particularly we come up with another situation of a Supreme Court justice happening between now and twenty twenty\nThose continuing with Lindsey Graham with a political price to pay\nWhat lessons do you think the president should take out of all of that I mean this was a moment where the party finally in line got unify behind what the president wants to do ... things on fire ... judges to renegotiate and what's next\nThe president should take the falling if you point a good person\nWho gets destroyed in a despicable manner and you fight for him people liking lore\nWhether you're Trump Republican uh Bush Republican libertarian are vegetarian Republican or altogether now thanks to this despicable attack on a good man here's what I Want the president and the do the right thing and fight for it and you'll get rewarded or Kevin I was going to be on the bench\nAnd those who tried to destroy him are going to be looked at and they're going to pay a price and I think this is going to help us in the mid term I hate that\nThis is what it took to help Republicans but to the other side you made the biggest mistake of your life to there's three Republicans who are all friends of mine if you are yes before this debacle please be us now costs everything they said about him\nJudge Kavanaugh has fallen apart he's a good man seven FBI investigations a hundred and fifty six people interviewed over twenty six year period all this stuff is garbage\nOther service garbage and let me tell you that's what they need to do the need to keep the pressure on that is political\n... owned a Democrat as far as political that needs to be what they say all the time but the next four weeks where they're just nailed is in and they'll do that and they'll talk about the political\nThe politics of it in that the dams or just being political they're obstructionists there there are only doing this because they don't agree with applause debate is not that his\nAbility as a grade is absolutely I was saying that he was rated as one of the highest ones that are ever been\nOut there as soon as they knew that\nHe was going to be a constitution was and when you're a constitution was then some of those things that you've done it have been unconstitutional sort of following through the cracks here and that's where we could change that this concept that he's going to change\nThe direction of the court is changing the Russian and the court only and this is that is he's a look at it whether it's constitutional or not and others have not\nIncluding Kennedy by the way including Kennedy was he did it in the Kentucky\nA ruling and how how he handled that that was absolutely incredible so to stay with um with Graham here and a platform of hate\nHouse impeachment manager I like a Ninety eight I remember it well and Democrats are pledging from the house they could very well move\n... it would be very difficult to do the fact that\nHappen if Republicans lose the house and keep the saga gone\nI think the Democratic party's been taken over by irrationality hatred is their only platform is not about what they like us who they hate and I can't believe in America you have to prove yourself innocent\nOr that you're guilty just by the accusation that there is no requirement or cooperate because you're a Republican and democratic male nominee were treated by the Republican says Kevin always treated by the Democrats every media outlet in the country be up in arms\nA mansion real quickly vote yes or no on Kavanaugh\nIf he listens to the people of West Virginia he will Brett deserves your boat or Joe he's my friend I've known him for a long time if you listen to humor and the people of West Virginia I'm going to remember\nHere they really are going to remember it I think that would be as they were mentioned to ah to do that and I I don't I think it will go with this dog you have enough votes to get there where he's not the deciding factor I think um I think it will do those go to Brian Brian ...\nThank you for taking thank\nYou for taking my call Dan appreciate it absolutely I've been listening to all of this uh starting from the uh the actual earring a Thursday a week ago\nAnd uh I\nI hear Lindsey Graham talked about sanctions against Democrats these these people have never had any more than ... slap on the wrist their whole life that's why they're able to get away with everything that they're able to get away with an until\nSomebody somewhere starts doing something and standing up voting is one way but these people do need to be punished and and punished to the end of the law I mean they deserve it I mean it it might that far off base\nNo okay well let me ask you when you when we're talking punish\nIs part of what needs to happen is the link situation is part of what needs to happen to this question or the attorneys and saying we gave you this letter used do does does she couldn't fly and that was a lie\nAnd did you give her the information you get this forward and information that we sent you because if you did and then we have a talk with the Washington bar association\nThese people committed felony they commit them every single day and this is nothing new we've been watching this in the beginning of the Obama era\nGive me an example of a sudden they committed\nThey lie constantly that go out of their way to lie to the to the public they live for the court system\nWas along the line to the public is against the law the lie under oath\nWhen you're in the Senate and you only stand up there and say something that you know it's not true\nIs that a lie under oath or is that just that's just that's just a lot to the ... if you're under oath is senators or sold them under oath by the way\nThese people don't deserve to live with the ... I'm Sorry [laughter] that may be a little radical but uh I I'm just so sick of hearing\nWill end here here's a part of the problem of of the function this networking and that's the media the media were doing their job and not just criticizing Republicans but they were actually calling out Democrats\nWhen they're doing something that is incorrect you know if you notice if a Republican do something procedurally as a writer they they don't think it's fair then they go crazy ABC NBC and CBS go nuts but if a Democrat goes and do something like not you know Ford\nThe opportunity to say look we this is this is this\nHave an FBI agent or as soon as that person coming interview you and to take down your testimony so we can follow this up and sing out she should have done that\nWhat exactly is the ethics committee there I mean if they're not going to police what what these people are doing out there or do we what are they there for\nThat that is worth ... that's what they are therefore but it's normally ethics of you know the the post office scandal and all that kind of stuff is more that type of things in procedural\nOperational type things but we don't even Bunsen did was absolutely wrong she ... she she basically put ms forward at risk she should have somebody to go out there is the attorney how much conversation did she have with the attorney about what\nMs Ford was going to do\nBecause if he was coaching the attorney to then go to move forward that is just wrong\nAnd and again procedurally was one thing to do\nI rest my case but there's nothing gonna happen to her\nWell now now now there's some things move Graham is getting very serious about this leak and the person to release the names\nI mean he he's actually turning over and say this we went into the very serious about these attorney missed Ford's attorney and finding out what happened there they're very serious about finding out about this polygraph thing was moves forward\nBut but then all of these things link that in some way shape or form the somebody at higher or whether it's Feinstein whether it's Clinton whether it's so rose wherever it is it always linked back to somebody higher up the chain and these people are never I mean I understand\nWhat it is actually normally the opposite of that is normally not the higher up is normally the low person who's kind of a bad person for an office and they they leak that or they get into the mix it\nRight they're the ones that get caught holding the bag but the one who wants to ultimately give the orders and playing out these elaborate ah ah I don't even know what you call it anymore\nEscapades like like a cabinet shop thing I mean that that was an etched in a in a back room in an hour to that\nThat was done weeks months they've even years in advance of this stuff was going to happen\nChevrolet Master control center says is W.

vote for me because she's going through all of his George Burns and defending all of it and calling out the Democrats on all of their uh specious arguments\nHere she is doing a good job say Graham who's doing\nIt doing as she she's doing this for the folks back home yeah you know and and I\nDo and also prime time you know she she will be right news in a\nWhile she'll be the most famous a Democrat or as I was ... already Muslim she'll be the she'll be the most back you probably can't say slip anymore after this right I think we're slip for broad [laughter] but but you\nKnow what a lot of people don't realize they gotta live wire Murkowski and a Collins so damn liberal I'm a ... go look at their contributions they get a ton of money from Planned Parenthood\nKnows them do and he's about to abortion rights right now than talking about Kevin ... precedent is not just you know a tradition but it's like constitutionally backed\nUp like a yeah I Know I don't I don't think I Would I Do see happening\nBecause I happen to know there's two really good circuit court of appeals cases on abortion percolating through up to the Supreme Court now what I Do see or some additional restrictions you know I'm ... due to the age of the infinite in the in the room you know that that stuff may may be happening because\nThe only way I Would see them reversing abortion period is if they had seven but they're not going to do it on a five four split or you know it's I just don't see that happening as much as I Would love that for that happened uh I don't I don't see it happening but\nUh so now Murkowski's or on the line with us she wants to but they don't need they really they really didn't need calm boat as long as max said on the right side and then parents would be the tie breaker right I mean so but uh [laughter] but but now mansion has no cover ... [laughter]\nSo yeah so as you mentioned the joining the women do games in it because he is not going to vote I think she's you know\nDan the greatest thing is it out at all the other Democrats in really serious red races right now and casino Heidi Heitkamp she's getting killed got Claire McCaskill she's getting killed uh what's his name and Indiana he's he's losing\nA an end up Scott or what things I had a Nelson and I talked to a mutual friend of ours Dan who does a lot of polling around he's he's in North Carolina doing polling\nFor some races there and I asked him um yesterday I haven't run into them I said it it I feel I feel the huge\nSurge of energy within the Republican Party now you have never Trump or saying this finally as you're not at all of us were Republicans again you know now we're all never Trump or ...\nAsked him are you seeing it in your polling because he says Chris\nHe says ten days ago it what is happening in the last days in the polling and like North Carolina and other states is amazing it's it's totally on fire for the Republican Party right now\nAnd of course you're seeing it showing up in the generic polls you've seen it Danielle I'm sure you're looking at all the you know the the investors business daily polling and some of the other things that are out there even even NPR's [laughter] you know pressing the panic button on the generic ballot poll [laughter]\nYou know they let me tell you the interesting part is that if you are in a red state then they're down ... and then Tuesday is ... is huge and this was going to kill Claire McCaskill\nRightly both saying we weeks ago she was a no vote that's going to pay for that\nWhile she's already what down seven points now I hike camp down Heidi Heitkamp was down ... points\nYesterday was a fascinating point Fifteen poison him\nMarsha Blackburn\nBut he said well I voted for the guy am I [laughter] I Can't believe my democratic friends are voting against\nThem [laughter] you know he really quick\nNow this is the deal\nYou know most most people make up their mind the week up I think this has made everybody everybody is totally focused and I think people have made up their minds who they're going to vote for and the races now\nThe question is after the vote has done tomorrow will the with the energy level goes down because you've accomplished what needed to be accomplished oil I Will say that you have to have more Republicans in their\n... well I think expose but I'm a ... you cannot keep the energy level at this high for that period of time I mean I'm exhausted you've got to be a cost you know all of us are but here's the deal\nTrump is non stop on the Trump train speaking and I mean when you have Ninety One thousand people try to get twenty thousand tickets in Johnson City Tennessee\nYou know [laughter] I mean he has lines of people there's just no drop off in the Thursday as men this is kind of refocused people are on the populist type arguments and you know and you know\nThey can't really argue that um that that that Kavanaugh some crazy loon he's a mainstream conservative judicial nominee any very brilliant person and I I just for his whole family I Hope we're\nAll of our states that he he gets the vote and of course if Susan Collins says she's going to vote for him then it's game over 'cause flakes already said he's coming out in favor of them so that's it right unless unless\nUnless somebody kills them ... and I asked the other thing the thing it's really got people upset that we can have people on the other side that we can disagree with they take different positions on policies and so forth\nBut when you start pounding people and chasing them out of restaurants doc sing them threatening to put their Children's Medical records on on a PDF\nAnd and you literally almost\nComfortable on you know that's when people say whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa no no no we're we're we're not doing that and do I believe the Democrat crazy whining and the Democrats are still going to keep doing it now I have no doubt about it and they're going to pay for it to\nYou know here's another kind of exercise is happening is where the Democrats so they were doing really good and talking to the un wash Massoud particularly women\nAnd they were trying to communicate to them and ABC NBC and CBS we're doing that they didn't realize how bad the message low in which state in America\n[noise] oh yeah oh yeah well no one knows\nWell you've seen um the even the gender gap is shrunk to less than ten points now I'm a ... men and women and voting Republican Democrat I mean it's it's shrinking there there are a lot of suburban women\nWho have been the victims of that might let me you know who my wife is right oh yeah let me let me give you a little perspective this is an interesting comment that she made to me\nShe said Chris I've been a professional for Thirty years and it makes me so mad that I cannot go into\nA man's office like a lawyer or judges and have a conversation without them having to leave the door open because of this kind of crap that's come out a man wants to go on and have a conversation\nA about a legal case with a a judge or his partner there is no problem branch out the door woman wants to go in there you got to pull the my parents you know and\nIt's just a year and she says you don't realize how much this ... this kind of crafts sets it I think that for professional women you know that they just feel like they can have ... men especially white males are so scared\nWe'll be celebrating two
