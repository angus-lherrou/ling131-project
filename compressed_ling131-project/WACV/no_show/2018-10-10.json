I mean this is maybe it's the first woman as your listeners know law I've been at the I I buy the crowd of being at the cutting edge of this kind of anti establishment a effort I've I've no battle Mitch McConnell for many years we disagreed on on just about every topic\nBut we got to you know he he stood tall normally Republicans cut and run the first founded the gunfire from the social justice or they will run because they're afraid of being they're afraid of being called racist they're afraid of all these false accusations Mitch McConnell with the president stood tall\nAnd actually shifted distance or\nAnd I think it was a seminal moment inflection point in the Republican Party and now I think we've got everybody and it's like I've said nothing but great things about the actual column for the last three or four days of the reasons he deserves kudos\nHe really show real leadership and did not cut and run in church kept if they'd cut and run judge kept the fight for judge Kavanaugh for his confirmation was a proxy fight on the Trump presidency and I think it it it it who's everybody to really understand that the Republican establishment\nAnd the populist movement and the grassroots conservatives and the Tea Party efforts will be you know all the evangelical groups all pulled together and that's that's why we want and that's what it's going to take this November and quite frankly I take that going forward so hopefully\nWe'll do it this is the beginning of people saying you know we've got to work together this is what happened and six to you know when I step to the campaign in August\nWe'll quite fractured everything pull together and wasn't me it was orange Priebus it was many many people that came together to bought the grass roots again that people like you with your show they bought the grassroots effort together with the establishment and we won in ... that's the lesson well where's the night it\nPut a difference is off the side we can defeat the Democratic party and here's the stakes are so hot\nLook at what happened at the look what happened at the vote object capital on the floor of the United States Senate\nLook to many people have had given their lives to this country\nThan with the rule of law the phone but we have that that behavior of those protesters were just unacceptable and what happened afterwards which are really kind of mob rule that's coming so if you want to ... to be like the senators were harassed\nAnd it's like Ted Cruz and his wife were basically a ... a by people at a restaurant and the chase down an alley if that's what you want the future could be built\nBut at the end by the way you may have to vote for ... and their district maybe a congressman that you're not particularly enamored with it doesn't matter right now it's all about the Trump program it's all about President Trump and going forward and that's why we got to pull together\nWell we're talking to Steve Bannon here on the ... show the ah the generic ballot has shrunk somewhat\nBut these distill the Republicans' biggest hurdle Steven these house races seems to be women voters women strongly are still supporting Democrats and some of these key races there's been a four point lead\nAnd what um the the post Washington Post and uh the shower school and they pulled a and this was districts as of August twenty four and a lot has changed since then but apparently it's about a four point\nAdvantage Democrats hold I think that's actually good news said it's only four points\nI think it's great news is really down from ... one polar audience just keep in mind when Paul Ryan decided not to run the we're talking about sixty votes or than it was fifty one on Sean Hannity on the hundred day to go and I was saying is thirty five to forty now within\nThe kill zone this is very winnable as all of that she was an agency even the post story to days a little dated 'cause it doesn't really talk about what happened after capital I think what we're going to see is remember President Trump won a white female voters fifty two forty eight which done Hillary Clinton\nWon a high school educated white voters who see no quotas sixty nine\nThirty one ... President Trump does resonate with women who who understand national security and women who are concerned that Law Order women who are concerned about the economy\nOr jobs so I think we have to get those female voters out and I think they will come out I I Love the book at the trend is in our favor it's trending a trendy to to uh stopping this blue weight and\nAnd people have to understand if we stop the blue way\nThe Democrats are going to turn on each other in a vicious wave between the Clinton Wall Street hunter and these kind of social justice a basic cultural marks on the left tear each other apart and I think lead us to a massive victory of two thousand twenty desperate search urgency\nWhere people really the focus on his house districts in the in the coming in the coming three or four weeks that we really this is all about\nYou know one of the great things I Love about being a conservative Republican at all or is that people understand it's about self reliance is getting up and doing something this is a hundred percent\nIn our our zone right now to the to turn this around I think you can look at every number the trend is that our favor\nYou know I certainly hope so see before we let you go let's talk about what's happening in Europe I Know you have the movement is called a in Arab ah ... you've done some more can Italy we see so many there are and other leaders but kind of saw Le Pen was meeting with so many yesterday the day before\nA and to try to again in recapture the European a cultural understanding or that it's been so threatened by poor leadership\nMass migration et cetera and where do things stand and in Europe I Know it's in every country is different but where things stand now\nBut you know this kind of populist nationalist revolt a disaster you're ahead of where we are in the United states that's what great it kind of came of the core of brings it\nAnd the two thousand six to victory Donald Trump are inextricably linked you're seeing the same thing in Europe right now we're basically what it is it's the same kind of Tea Party grassroots revolt you know ... an evangelical Christian revolted too soon over in Europe what you're saying there's people that want their sovereignty back to their countries are tired\n... has tried to take their their national sovereignty and take the value of their citizenship away from that whether it's on migration economics a whole host of\nOf issues and you're seeing leaders like Le Pen in France or the alternative ...

biggest investment more than likely at your home\nThey're treated that way when you hire a painting contractor abs\nPainting there are no gimmick low Ninety nine dollars special quality painting as some other traits your home with the same respect that you do\nMaybe is painting we have been fighting for years and look forward to many more years to come with PBS painting the job gets prep properly weather is playing scraping or priming\nWe always used quality product which is a much broader quality fake job\nIf you're looking for a painter but does it need upfront money is on the job at all times please give me a call [noise] got Bauer abs painting to now for five on to to\nThat PBS famous tuna for Fifteen or twenty to\nOn Facebook abs painting Montgomery\nRobotic version\nLeaders

income\nShow and five five forty Laura Nikki Haley's resigning\nAmbassador I have a feeling she's going to be doing something else\nFor the president that's my sense\nOf but I have no inside knowledge or he's appearing with her that's the reason I think there may be something else in mind for Nikki Haley\nA and\nAlmost this kind of coming up and just a few moments so you want to keep it right there we have a great show on tap tonight uh the Ingram angle you do not want to miss it rains previous is going to stop by Andy McCarthy\nAs impeachment of Kavanaugh is not taken off the table now the sound is kind of oversold from book or over the weekend when he was in Iowa\nBut he was asked about it and she's and\nHe basically it was like well it's we got a lot to focus on\n\nWe have a lot to focus on but that's not at the top of our agenda and Guerra Monday was on Fox or something I don't know we planted on Fox maybe it was CNN a congressman Gary Monday who also I think they're trying to downplay this\nWhere they were trying to downplay the impeachment after they've seen these polls\nAnd so this congressman cycle that's not why my people in my district are saying they're not saying that they're clamoring for impeachment of Kavanaugh see I thought they actually tried to do that because it'll just me and the Republicans will smash them back\nJust smash them back was that Steve ... he was on he said well maybe he's more of a straight shooter he's the host on MSNBC and he's looking at these numbers independence are moving toward Republicans and Cavanaugh is a big part of it\nI came falling behind by living points in one poll last week and then eleven point gap came before she announced her opposition to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court so again if you if you lose a cabin or see your democratic right at that point you got to pick up and Arizona that's doable you got to pick up and is that er\nDoable but then you're going to need like a Tennessee or a Texas also the polling news not encouraging for Democrats the latest poll he was at a Texas either\n[noise] ah yeah I mean the ...\nThing he's not alpha he's ...\nI just made that up someone else's probably said that but I Swear it in there and even all say well\nTed Cruz's Martin alpha guy\nBeta ... more of a beta man are they doing beta max like all sorts of jokes with him and they like James or something Robert right\nAnd then we all ... it's cool it's like Obama Iraq instead of Barry I mean you got to sound cooler than you are\n\nOh it's a it's a DWI what was that he was in trouble for DWI or some some minor minor theft or ... I don't know what it was that those are those are high jinx guys can't hold people accountable for things they do in their twenties I mean things they do in there\nAnd no no no no that does come on baby do is just he's ... you can't hold 'em to any other standard has to do it is real first name is Robert Francis okay Robert Francis\nO'Rourke can't get more Irish\nSo but it's ... all that he was called that as a baby or a little boy I guess not stuck\nWhy called deem a demon dog but um when he when he was like for a promotion I'm not he's not going to say well the dog is running like I when I see the matrix that has a dog doing ... nicknamed the theme a dog so we call them dog\nFather he's not going to say OK call me dog 'cause that's what my mother called me I assumed that when he's going to build and listening to the Laura Ingraham show a five five forty Laura ... I'm not saying it last night\n\nI felt that at the White House with the the energy of the people the energy of the old establishment even like Mitch McConnell I've never seen Mitch McConnell more happy in my entire life ever never seen him smile like this I've never seen him better than he has been over the last three weeks never seen Lindsey Graham better\nAnd you know why they're doing what the people want and they're United with the president that is a good thing\nThat's great keeping up that's fantastic I praise people when they deserve it and they deserve it\nWhat I think they should go on for a ... is ... Shaw who were not been able to figure out how to achieve and it was\nWe were literally hunger social ... trying to get in our ... our homes or ... ... almost ...\nWell that's a that's by the way that's Mitch sounding excited\nBut I'm On a journalist ... natural and he's been yeah it's always on an adrenalin rush that's how he found me Nikki Haley just a guy had an allergic reaction to that little ear cup they put on her ear for the translation of simultaneous translation they wouldn't provide her with a high bar allergenic or air cup so she has to just\nI really think it's time for someone else well here's a story I was talking about earlier\nTrump Administration disowned hit Nikki Haley's plan for a un meeting on air on\nThis is ... September seventeenth during the cabin are crush\nThe Trump Administration is disarming a plan presented by UN ambassador Nikki Haley for President Trump to hold a meeting\nAt the un that was next week a couple of weeks ago focused on Iran according to diplomats familiar with the meeting Haley had announced that Trump would share a meeting on the world's biggest diplomatic stage quote to address Iran's violations of international law in general instability Iran so throughout the entire Middle East region\nFocusing the meeting on Iran drew immediate concerns from us allies who believe that the topic would expose sharp disagreements among the U.S Britain and France\nThe twenty Fifteen Iran nuclear deal which Trump unilaterally withdrew from an may other U.S officials also voiced concerns\nThat an article of UN Charter would allow Iran to participate in the meeting because it's quote a party to the to the dispute under consideration raising the prospect of an awkward and contentious stand up between Trump and representative of Iran seems like the Trump Administration was right about this one stay there\n\nUm ...

I I had to put the champagne glass down and then go do my show last night\nWe were celebrating at the White House it was fantastic everybody who helped Brett was there\nAll the justices were there everybody was there who you know who who really was instrumental in helping this nomination this confirmation his law clerks his old law clerks who helped it was great great to see everybody but maybe I'm just a little tired so I Can't follow the\nBrilliant and incisive logic of costs you ...\nI think a lot of it has to do with changing our strategy around\nInside the beltway I Do now you can only say that term thrown around\n\nOkay these just asked you what are you going to do and she answers well we're changing our governance strategies inside baseball\nI'm a forgive me but she at least from what I've heard she seemed like a very attractive person and maybe she's a very nice individual I'm sure she's a nice person\nShe got people to go out and vote vote for her she probably a nice person I don't understand what she's saying we need more organizers okay you'll be in government you will be in there\nBut you see all goes back to what I'm saying they have NO PLAN for how to improve this economy it's all about creating the new social construct to lay on top of the u._s. understanding\nAs it has to be like all abortion\nAll gender fluidity higher taxes open borders legalize everyone legalize drugs pot all\nAll of it has to be force it on the American people select Obama she never really will\nLeave the organizing world there are very few organizers and Congress and I think that organizers operate differently is a different kind of strategy\nYou know they they they have enough money for mommy and daddy to just walk around with these profane signs and whale and moan and claw at things like the Supreme Court big brass door\nThat Supreme Court video how many have you thought it was as funny as I did so last night on the angle every time I ticked off a Trump agenda item winning agenda item every time I did that\nWe played a snippet of of the protesters clawing at the door to make a point the better things are getting in America the more than happy\nThey are but the ... I just found that to be a ...\nBy the way there are a lot of different angles that people got with their cell phone videos of the protesters clawing up the door so you can see like the the hundred and twenty pound guy\nLooks like he's wearing skinny jeans he's banging then you go and you see the woman that was like this this liberal woman who's like trying to pry open each of these doors of I'd walk through them enough times I Know\nThese doors probably way their their ceremonial doors\nThey probably way I don't know four hundred pounds their giant\nClawing at the door is trying to open them this is kind of a metaphor though isn't it for what they're they're trying to their clawing and banging at the more traditional understanding of America\n[laughter]\nShould America down\nThis shutting\nThe traditional understanding of America down to about ... than they know they're not going to shut the Supreme Court down scores of course going to go on I heard oral arguments this morning they continue to go on but it's about shutting down\nYou your voice intimidating you so you're you're back in the corner of an elevator\nIt's about shutting down this idea of traditional families it's about shutting out the idea of understanding of American history\nShut it down pulling statues down with ropes and the middle of the night it's all a piece of what they are and what they become and its public schools it's ...\nIt's the mass migration in the country of people who are here illegally who are not brought up to understand what makes this country so great in our in our history\nTo understand why this is so important to preserve our country you really do have to understand why how it was so hard to founded this country the American founding against all odds we founded this great republic and\nThe term rent tremendous sacrifice of our framers the original are signatories of our constitution great sacrifices they made but if you don't understand any of that then you kinda just arrived here in America's yeah it's it can make money here boys\nIs so great can make money and China may go on in ... Qatar and make\nMoney a lot of places and why this place so great why is it why is it special so we can see what we saw over the weekend\nProtesters fine ... that protest is is is ... welcome under our First Amendment I'm Talking about the way you protest but whether it's a dignified or undignified and we're not seeing a lot of Rosa Parks out there today we're not seeing the classic non violent\nClassy way of protesting this is a good or approach to protest\nTo run senators out of restaurants go to their home is that going too far\nThat it just means that there are a lot of people who are very very much ah I'm motivated or what is going on as hard as hell they because they look at white supremacy her and all that and this is her come forth in our country and\nShe went to their Alexander Acosta ... school of logic apparently\nHer on her own a winter hers or ...

joining U.S Open bones this hour\nAAA eight to five five two to five [noise] that's AAA eight to five five two to five\nJordan is in Indianapolis Hi Jordan welcome Ramsey show\nAny they'd how's it going better than I deserve what's up over the last week I completed my free journey or by over forty years paying out over four hundred and thirty five dollars and I'm\nWhere I'm trying to figure out now in terms of buying a house what is the best way to kind of saying I'm going to have been taking about just talking the money but all coming back from ... to maybe get a better rate of return by doing that way what what are your thoughts on that right job for a job so I'm not sure you're going to save\nWell as it right now my monthly expenses are only about eleven hundred show out of my salary trying to say about twenty two to twenty three hundred and if I really buckle down about twenty six hundred a month correct\nFor how long [noise] well the ... at the house I'm looking I I get a twenty percent on a down payment on a hundred and fifty call you about at least ten months better minimum that put me around ... percent but by the year should be able to get that it can include burn shouldn't tax return um such okay well\nIf you invested started thousand dollars which you don't have today but if you were to invest thirty thousand dollars and it made ten percent in one year you would make three thousand dollars correct okay I'm now we don't have ... thirty thousand dollar so it's like\nOver the course of the year you'd have more like an average of Fifteen thousand dollars invested and so if you make ten percent you'd make about Fifteen hundred dollars\nOkay and so if you have thirty thousand dollars at the end of one year to put down on a house\nOr you have thirty one thousand five hundred dollars to put down on the house doesn't matter buck\nWithout um Iraq the point I was born I was huge saving money on the short term as aggressively as you have the ability to save money um is the secret sauce not the investment\n\nOkay during this year Jordan is worth thirty grand\nMutual fund Fifteen hundred Jordan is the answer to our equation okay that makes sense they're sort of in other words if you just said your budget saved an extra hundred bucks a month you would have made more doing that\nThen you would have on the investment yeah so you are the secret sauce do\nYou figure that out now when you started messing over the long term\nWe're talking about twenty or investment uh thirty or investment where the Roth IRA area mutual funds for your kid's college or something like that where you got Twenty years that's when the right of return starts to be very very important but what are you a short window like this it's not worth the risk\nDave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell day a long story short ah um\nRight and then the [noise] and I have about three hundred and eighty thousand in a student loans mainly all from a\nMedical school headlong most planning I was planning to do or the public service loan for getting this program know to pay it off our um bad then kind of fall too with my current and I mean\nI'm just trying to figure out the will do a good way to pay that off into so comfortably and dead ends meet 'em dead for youth a financial burden\nOkay just for a future reference thirty thousand people have no applied for the a loan for the federal loan service forgiveness ... service forgiveness Ninety six have been granted it\nOut of thirty to out of thirty thousand it's a complete scam it's not happening the government is screwed you're so good I'm Glad you're not signed up for that so what is your income please God told me as large\nA combined I'm married so with my wife ah about three hundred and thirty\nGood [noise]\nOkay so you're gonna ... you don't get to live like a doctor because you're a broke Dr yeah you're gonna live like a college student okay help you out and start buying crap\nCan't answer that have you started buying crap and bought bought one thing is just one what the car what'd you buy\nA car a God yeah yeah uh now do you know what'd you pay for it about fifty thousand okay\nHere three hundred and eighty thousand dollars in debt you can never do that again\nI don't plan to\nCan never do anything like that again you're not only on vacation you're not buying a house you are a broke doctor\nHere's the thing you have this absolutely fabulous income and you are going to destroy your wealth building ability with that income if you don't clear this data and treat it like it's cancer and we're going to hit it with chemo and everything we got\nOut of hand so that I Am not a band aid off slowly guy that crap does not work and so what I Would do if I woke up and your shoes as I Would live on fifty thousand dollars a year or less which would make me debt free in under three years\nOkay and then I Would start my life the great news is you have the ability to delay pleasure for greater outcome we know that because you've gone to school your whole freaking life [noise] and you're very smart academically\nOr you wouldn't be where you are okay and you have the ability to delay pleasure which is a sign of emotional maturity and you have a great intellect let's use those two things and apply them to this mess that you are in called deeply in debt now you're going to what the other way but I'll tell you this\nYour colleagues\nAre walking around out there with three hundred four hundred two hundred thousand dollars worth of medical school dad for a decade because they play with it and they never kill the disease the only way you kill it is extreme treatment\nRadical and that's the only way it goes away it's going to stay with you forever otherwise\nSo that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes I Would treat it like I Am I broke doctor what goes on broke doctor and broke doctors don't by fifty thousand dollar cars are going fifty thousand dollar vacations so you're not doing that crap anymore you get on a tight budget beans and rice rice and beans\nThree year old older than you are now you and go forward with a three or four hundred thousand dollar income and no debt you're going to be so wealthy it's going to be blinding if you watch what you're doing\nBut if you could just screw around with this thing and keep it like it's a pet it's going to be a problem for you Laurie is with us in Boise idaho Hi Laurie how are you\nDave thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nI'm at this point where I like to be giving 'em\nRight now at their ... and my mom has been in a nursing home for ten years or ... and I moved here at the kind of thought of and she is in a very very small room and they have a large one man and I was wondering what that he can centered giving\nTo help get her into her semi private ram and help pay for her cost of living\nTrue was somebody giving 'em would it be tithing no but it would be giving yes um I don't have I mean I don't know what you mean by giving but um you have the money to do this or you baroque or what\nBut now I have the money to guess okay and you're you're out of debt yeah okay and you have how much money in your nest egg\nThree hundred of them and how old are you having good very good okay what's your income\nAbout Ninety thousand cool you're single I'm Single and what are you talking about spending here\nIt will cost me about a thousand dollars a month\nOkay so twelve ran out of Ninety and you can keep saving doing that 'cause you don't have any that you can keep investing so you retire with dignity and you can take care of yourself when you're in the exact same situation later right that's\nWhat I Want to be on one of gay people where you don't put yourself exposed to the elements so to speak by helping someone else but I think it's wonderful you have the money you've done a great job you're out of debt and you're in a position you want to give twelve thousand dollars a year toward your mom's sure\nNo problem with that OK absolutely what do they want to do the right thing in in\nLike he said about giving scientists wanting to make sure I was doing the right thing so\nI think you're it was a wonderful gift and uh your your kind to her and you know what a wonderful\nYou know act of love torture mama and and and again you put yourself in a position you have the money to do that without bringing harm\nTo yourself and that's that's what we're talking about live like no one else so later you can live and the ... like no one else was very very cool Tony is with us Tony is in a Washington Hi Tony how are you\nI'm well good I can help I was\nCurious why you advocate a money market accounts are low you account for like your emergency on\n'cause your emergency phone is not an investment it's insurance\nIt's there the principal has to be there and accessible and liquid because if you're a transmission goes out of you lose your job you get your hands on it the rate of return is irrelevant it's insurance they protects the things\nDoes make you money to see what happens is people don't have an emergency fund act accessible and they got to the set up in something where they get penalized if it comes out is not liquid and then they they have an emergency you know what they do the borrowing a four one K. long like a four one K. long they borrow against her for winter the cash it out worse yet\nAnd they create a mess because they got to do that to save their house 'cause they didn't have money that was like what they got stuck because they're all worried about trying to make an extra point or two on the money instead of Kurt treating it like it's insurance insurance\nYou would agree is an expense because it sucks it's a horrible right of return it could be invested in be making more but that portion that five or ten or twenty thousand dollars or whatever it is just sitting there just as a barrier between you and the life\nAnd that's all it's for it's not an investment it's insurance investments make money insurance costs you money to protect the things that make you money and decision church so a good question though so that's the whole reasoning behind that thanks for calling him open follows a triple eight eight to five five two\nTo five yeah we're in a rainy day fund you know why because it's gone on\nIn ... and you better\nYou got to get ready for this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\n\nLet me tell you a story about two families litter of very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nTheir dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't big difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just goes and or insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two\nYou know what I'm Talking about right what do you tell him\nThe secret to getting out of that is why did this work we had to be under the same page and obviously the first week we weren't on the same class started here was about and eventually she got me on the same page for\nOkay but I mean what do you do you tell them the key to getting out of the same page what else and follow the baby steps now okay very cool yeah work together yeah you got to tell your class was your story if you don't I mean you should this is great I mean the whole the whole story the loading there I mean there's a stay at home that's that's real\nThat people will be unreal and there are so many people

great deal very very very fun Giovanni payments in the world is I feel weird it was great\nI have going to say it feels great you know in the last few months since we paid off house we've done a lot we've been home to visit family um I think some of the pictures that we showed Dave I if I can share just a little something I'm we thought we were going to come here in June ... um with our intention

[noise] I don't necessarily want to give them millions of dollars on the team but nor do I wanna hold it over and Michael he's like thirty five either\nGood good balance like that I agree with both statements and so you wind down by releasing some of it at different times\nUm we had our set up a before our kids you know became adults are trying to serve the same situation so\nWe put it together we both get hit by a bus or the millions of dollars in a trust to beat good used only for their good uh we did not leave the money to the guardian we left it into a trust which is the proper thing to do I trust is formed only at your death\nWe put in that trust exactly how the money was to be invested the four types of mutual funds for instance that I recommend we put in that trust that the income off of the investments can be used for their care and feeding of the kids and the use of the guardian at their will beyond that if they needed money out of that trust\nIt has to be for a major medical thing possibly a little bit on a first car and cut paying for college but coming out of college when you graduate from college we would release a percentage and then we'd released another percentage at twenty five\nAnd another percentage at twenty seven I think we did a maybe a third third third I don't remember but we let them kind of roll it out a little bit like you say I don't want to hold a too long but also don't want an Eighteen year old to hit the lottery\nAnd things like what we're thinking about doing too so\nYeah so you lay all of that that way and um you know we put hours and

if that's your heritage and that's your your your faith and wonderful or by caused the town that has a lot to say about the issues that you're dealing with um a lot\nAnd um so yeah I that's the only thing I Know how to tell you to do because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realize this is ruining your life\nAnd um you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is and you're finding this from the twelve steps is that one of the thing is you Roger powerless and you know God has to step in and I've got to put some structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out a ... there's some\nCareful psych self analysis and say well loneliness is the issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm

is with us in Dayton, Ohio hey Billy welcome to the Ramsey show\nHey Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up my wife and I are in the process of trying to consider buying a house the challenger running into is that we own to rental houses in we currently rent a one we live and then we don't want to take on more debt\nSo properties or um you know how the just sort of NATO that and I'm not getting into too much okay do you have\nWhat is what are these rentals worse\n[laughter] well one of the challenges that we face is that the rental properties are actually out of town on them I'm a military guy and we're currently living in Dayton, Ohio when a rental properties earn Georgia in Virginia so I'm the value sell them\nYes I Would not long distance landlord okay no that's your health and they were asking for trouble you need the money you're in the military are trying to buy a home and you need the money and they don't need to be alone you got you did not set out to own rental property everywhere these rental properties by default\nWho's not you're not you're five your strategy to buy rental properties all over the United states\n\nThat's been in the inclination that I've been getting from a couple of folks that have been talking to my mom I haven't been seen though is that they've been successful I've had renters that have been paying the mortgage and um it seems like there there's the possibility of the value going up\nAnd put them under the values of go up but I'm also sure somebody's gonna change their hardly or when you're living room because you're out of town\nThis is going to happen I I I've got rental properties man I got a bunch of them I don't know probably for forty years and um you've got to be I I just don't do any long distance landlord it I don't have any property that I ran out that is not in my town\nAnd are you did not by not by these properties plan you ended up\nWith them and you're trying to move on to the next phase of your life

sales for one hundred and Ninety thousand dollars for the typical home sold by an agent is\nTwo hundred and forty nine thousand dollars I'll do the math for you that's fifty nine thousand dollar difference so here's the secret to making more money selling your home you need a high octane rock star real estate agent in each one of our real estate endorsed local providers these folks are the top ten percent of agents in your area\nSo I think your bank wants to see you deeply in debt does that's what banks do\nSo well is when a bank says hey I had a great idea what they're really saying is hey I can make some money off of you\nI mean really it's like playing with a skunk and wondering why you got sprayed seriously it's not it's not a pet it's a skunk so don't pet it\nLet's do this is

I'm On the clock on you know addresses license plates and whatnot and the nominee has become bigger and society at the time I didn't know what was going on and people didn't understand what I was trying to tell them but um I\nKind of thinking that this might be a tell a path like experiences well seeing something like two two two on the clock I'm thinking of important messages you know something important in your life seeing these signs\nSo I kinda think that it's all intertwined and then just one more thing um\nWe know awhile ago someone had told me\nUm you know the spirit and this whole are actually different I I Believe and maybe a Bible or some religions it's the body and mind here at all and so I kind of think that what you're saying is differentiating\nBetween this it's like the spirit\nOr the other person is is it's outside and the spirits inside or [laughter] or either or but um I\nI kinda think of it on a spiritual level what you're saying as well\nI Would say more birds initial maybe one in the see what effect\nIt thank you for your question Monday I'm I tend to agree with you George and there's an algae I Love also from Dr Bernardo Castro which summarizes the way I think about things which is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness\nAnd each of us is like a white school within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we are fundamentally still made out of water\nSo what happens when the physical body dies that's like a world full of dissipating in the water doesn't leave the stream it just transitions into a different state\nAnd so the water to me is consciousness and consciousness is having this variety of experiences whether localized intellectual or otherwise industry\nDo you think the consciousness\nIs a normal process of living or its supernatural\nThe way I view consciousness is that it's like ... she said I regard consciousness as fundamental regard matter as to rebut of from consciousness meaning that consciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things points to that but I Do\nYeah modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow has this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective I subscribe to a leads to a very bleak outlook on life once your brain doctors over\nI mean I understood the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching um now I think that that consciousness does not died when the body dies because of the consciousness isn't dependent on the body\nSo I see much more uh meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish that had been taught me a long time ago but going back to the near death experiences what people often report is known as a life revealed\nWhere they experience their whole life in a flash and again this is when their brain as either offer highly impaired\nAnd they're judging themselves for how they acted during their life but this is the kicker that really I think about this every day is that some people report experiencing the life review through the eyes of those they affected\nSo let's say Bob harm to change in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experience the pain through chains eyes and he comes back to his life forever changed carrying much more about uh how we treat people rather than material goods\nSo it when we talk about meaning in life life review as a potential lens if we take that as a literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given this gift to be able to do these incredible things\nThrough consciousness cognition fill up at the ... and things like\nThat well yeah I think that these are natural abilities that we tend to have in the telepathy study I mentioned earlier where people are thirty two percent rather than twenty five percent there's a subtle ability even ... and people who aren't trained\nI think their abilities that are just simply not harness in modern society because these ideas are considered a novelist and totally paranormal and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book itself so compelled to do it is that\nAn understanding human potential and these abilities that we have could revolutionize I think the world but also our science and our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do\nFirst time caller John in Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\nYou doing sir great I'm an ex military and I will tell you I don't believe in ghosts UFOs and everything else but I Will say that again retired military I was assigned to a multinational units two thousand six and Iraq\nWere by the way to preserve it for ...\nCase that I was assigned to an empty every intelligence unit and we basically we're looking for a bomb maker\nUm we were able to use what I understand the remote viewing from a section of BS free intelligent shop where there was a coal location for a boss and some building we were able to find that three you Avi\nThe person I Believe who was the remote viewer that was brought in\nA was bald and I believe he wasn't no by no which is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was ... Israeli descent from what I can get of who I dealt with over there mhm\nMy question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in the remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or non American ... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture\nPromote you are\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\n\nI Would say that what what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something with the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our eyes outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the wall or an allergy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water that outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us you know sir ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately what me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise]\nA lot of things that I dealt with by including those sightings and everything else I've been able to do something else\nOkay so you're you're basically a skeptic will believe if you find the proof\nWe're also looking forward to the study with people in the United states [noise]\nNow that's carnival er Cox C.

welcome back to coast to coast our final segment with mark ... market can we concluded that consciousness is a part of the universe always was\nAnd that it survives outside of the physical brain the physical body but it's there it's out there in the ether I mean can we categorically all agree on that\nTo me the evidence points in that direction more strongly than any other direction when\nYou put together the phenomenon that we've discussed tonight a psychic phenomena like ... the psycho can eat as pre cognition near death experience as children with at like memories when you put all these together combined with certain phenomena of quantum physics it's they get\nThat consciousness is playing this fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the bird ...\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your show continue blessing thanks wonderful really wonderful and my uh my question is do you can get another got tons of cars a reincarnation as a result of consciousness living outside the body in each of us\nSo it can be a consciousness moves on to affect another human being good or evil out just free will play a part in or effect consciousness and I'll take my reply on rent\nFree will have anything to do with a mark ...\nIs is a very tricky question I think the question or free will get ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking out that had the free well\nUm are we talking about the whole body having free will are we talking about the consciousness itself and if we think of consciousness as being like the cream of water than all there is is conscious\nSo at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infinite ... well but at the level of perhaps ... an individual that is considering itself to be separated from that consciousness\nPretty well did not exist at the same level that make that\nYeah it does it on a very difficult subject\nIt very difficult and I think there are some of the concept that we're talking about tonight I think are beyond what our linear human mind can conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know in any gigs is can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concepts that our brains just limited understanding finally\nDid you think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and how to how to do with how to use it or any ...\nI I think there were probably people throughout history\nUm who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how Jesus might've interplay with consciousness but from the pieces I I've heard it's possible that he was one of these individuals\nWho really understood how things work and it seems when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nWe have a guest his name's Joseph a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he is conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of the doubt\nThat the ability of the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose and his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested and ... and ... and he said it's uncanny so if somebody goes into Las Vegas upbeat positive\nUh there's a high likelihood they're going to win but if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results are on candy\nI think that's all tied together like consciousness it's all part of the same don't you\nKnow I'm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just stay out of consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just a stream of consciousness\nThen the reality we're in is almost malleable and sometimes very subtle where you have a random number generator that behaving slightly non randomly in other cases we have reports like he talked about a metal being and using the mind\nSo who's to say that outcomes which is just a part of the physical reality could also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a cello James\n... a real quickly before a ... like my favorite I like the a prospect of this this agree with a that a is a bill about the effects of a drug this Bush and the on the mind you know the indicator\nThat consciousness is the product of the mind ... I'm\nA you know as you the person speaking into a tape recorder as an example um you know but that example would be a consciousness\nAnd uh the play back of the tape recorder or you know the type it wrinkles clinical do something will end up playing this thought it a\nMore of a you know distortion that would be an example of the drug mine you know it's not the consciousness but that's the fate of the apparatus has I'm\nBringing about a distortion cope with consciousness put in it so it's not coming out in this to clarity that's you know a wholesome of consciousness that went into it [noise]\nUh but anyway uh uh I think the prime example of a a spirit living outside of the body is that the self when you have a Gulf team so you have a\nThe example of a active consciousness uh\nHe was able to live with paid have knowledge of events that you know maybe it shouldn't uh otherwise uh till it could nieces and everything else I think this the prime example of consciousness outside the body right there\nWhat do you think of them are\nWell there are studies using on mediums people who can communicate with the ... the swimming is related to what James was just describing and they're actually controlled studies that have been done at the wind bridge Research Center and these studies\nAre use five levels of blinding where the media and the person who allegedly can communicate with the deceased\nIs speaking on the phone to the researcher and all that person knows is the first name of the dead person and they're able to bring in non chant information and there have been to peer reviewed journal studies on this ... thing that the mediums are able to\nObtain information we need more research on it but that's an example of someone who appears to be deceased and a living person getting information about someone who is deceased\nWhere do you think in some mediums do you think some of them are very effective\nUh easier raising important point I think there's a tendency um I think in the mainstream to say that there are frauds out there that are claimed to be mediums and maybe there are some fraud I think there are some people that\nHave real abilities and the wind bridge Research Center as one example where they they heavily screened the mediums and these people are able to do things you can explain I'm also looking back historically there are many cases back sometimes from the Eighteen hundreds of people that were studied rigorously one is named Mrs piper\nAnd she was study by William James ... ... the famous psychologist and a detective out her around to make sure that she couldn't get information from normal sources and she was able to do things that were amazing so I think it's possible that some people have extraordinary abilities\nLet's go west Steven's with us in Eugene Oregon now Hi Stephen\nKing George are always saying there's no such thing as coincidence right I'm I'm sitting here\nReading we reading a book I first read forty years ago and high school\nCall and we'll since the mind parasite uh-huh which sort of deals with a lot of these kinds of subjects and just as your guest in the last hour said the word psycho Kenney says\nMy ... my eyes ... where the cost of the page and read us yeah this is the wreck is the direct action of the mind upon batter\nFor him to give you ideas to update your kitchen or looked him up on Facebook a custom cabinet renovation seven nine nine Ninety eight Seventy three make me feel really like\n[noise] the whole the whole [noise] local Seoul [noise] whole bowl [noise] I'm\n\nOn the\nMany of them\nWon't loan\nMe while\nI think from my side and you know\nAs long as you love me go\nAh\nMoment when\nHe was about a ... mile\nOr so about a ground\nMe me me\nThey're like wow\n\nYou know when when one side of the country in a bike lane\nI don't know\n\n\nThey're uh\nHa ha\nHa ha\nRon I'm a little live wire a wedding draw\nRow row\nRow\n\nNa\n\n\n\n\n\nNa na\nNa na na na where\nNo\nNo five dollars and think oh\nThere\n\nAre\nA\nLot\n\nOf\nChevrolet Master control center visit W.

Smith was in law school he actually interned with me for a short period of time I think are almost six months or years ago [noise]\nAnd I'm I'm happy to have him ah on the city council it's great to see 'em up there I saw the name pop up on that like I said I I I looked at the races over there because uh I did have a brief period of consultation with one of the campaigns\nAnd uh [noise] I um I saw Brett Smith on there and a con which look and turns out he won he won ... he won handily four twenty to forty one of the runoff over generalizing so Brad Smith is now in ward for a\nAnd a Rhonda Anders uh is the mayor of Auburn that they're doing great things over the city of Auburn as a great great town over there and uh you could do a lot worse than having Rhonda Anders\nBe your mayor if you're a an author resident number two seven to nine to drink as this out with a broken and brought you Barbara good friends over in mid town pizza kitchen ... kitchen does a fine job day in day out\nAnd if you are if you wanted to know and\nI Know you do I'm not going to teach you the special this week is Diana [noise]\nWhite wine lemon juice sauce over linguine with shrimp and [noise]\nWhat else was on or something else on there\nIs a dynamite dish the dynamite dish\nBut now what they're going to do is they're going to put a U turn lane in the left lane on ... on Taylor rode on the north bound lanes or they can put a uterine lining there you're going to go down like you're going to a un but you're not going to go down that far and you turned back and then turn on and get on icy\nFive south that way\nThat doesn't sound like a terrible idea to me that doesn't sound like a terrible idea to me the terrible idea was putting all of that development there without getting Taylor road widened in and ready to handle it\nThey put they put a gigantic mall area there shopping strip malls and everything else then they added development across the street with whole foods and in Buffalo wild when I go over there I like rock and roll sushi and all that I liked the food over there I liked that little development I'll go to the whole foods from time to time is there something specific I Need\n\nIs not that I'm knocking the development of developments fine it's not doing anything wrong with being there it's just that the city didn't properly plan and and make sure Taylor wrote could handle it\nAnd so what you end up with is rex all the time right there and been in inevitably people are going to lose their lives and property in in more than a near daily basis and it's a it's frustrating so that's coming that's kind of good for good for Taylor oh good for the city Montgomery that's going to be good that's going to be glad to have um\nIs there any more local news in here in front of knock all local stuff out so we get to the big stuff [noise]\nUh what else do we have here I don't think we do\nObviously Michael Turner what else to [noise] ah oh yeah I got an a local story here Planned Parenthood is getting involved in Alabama's elections in a big way [noise] they're getting involved in Alabama's elections in a big way [noise] um\nAnd there's more to the story than the a P or or or or type Stacy and his excellent right up on a daily news dot com has a there's more to the story of why Planned Parenthood is getting involved in Alabama elections um Alabama is no threat to expand the protection of abortion [noise]\nBut they are in a great threat to drastically restrict\nDrastically restrict\nAccess to abortions in Alabama provided the United States Supreme court cooperates well in in in order to do that you have to sort of lay the groundwork before the Supreme Court gets their cases\nBecause all hell breaks loose after that and we still have a bunch of terrible liberal judges like Myra Thompson sitting in the a\nDistrict courts in Alabama and we have frankly a judges who are hostile the pro life positions are like a I don't want to go naming them but [noise] one of their daughters is a congresswoman or here in Alabama but ah they're hostile to pro life at the eleventh circuit level as well so the Supreme Court's gonna have to to to sort of\nTake the big position on this the Supreme Court's gonna have to take the big position on this and in order to get out in front of it states like Alabama are gone ahead and laying the groundwork the constitutional amendments and otherwise that will while be unconstitutional now will\nYou go\nWhen the Supreme Court inevitably throws roe versus Wade out and sins abortion law back to the states is Alabama at risk of being a state where you cannot get an abortion at all yeah hopefully hopefully um except in the very rare instances maybe one or two a year the actual life or the mothers in jeopardy\nOr outside of that\nUh I Do think Alabama is is primed and ready to go to to outlaw the travesty that is abortion or here in the state of Alabama and I look forward to them doing that there's a there's a pro life ballot initiative the sanctity of life amendment or on the Alabama\nBallot here in November So when you go to vote for Kay Ivey or walk medics or or a\nSteep marshal or Joe ... who will be our guest on friday or when you go to vote for these people in November if you slide down there will be an amendment amendment to\nAnd it's going to\nBasically declared Alabama pro life state and and paved the way truthfully to outlaw abortions in in almost all cases provided again the United States Constitution or is interpreted correctly at the United States Supreme court\nAnd uh and they throw out these is a this horrific line of cases that allowed the wholesale slaughter of sixty million Seventy million people in this country are you guys think the Holocaust was bad holy mackerel\nUm the Holocaust was was baby poop compared to what's going on in the abortion clinics even right here in in Montgomery, Alabama [noise] um\n\nSo bland and has get involved to the tune of about eight hundred thousand dollars now\nIn the event you think well eight hundred thousand dollars is not a lot of money\nA amigos that is more than either gubernatorial candidate has on hand right now they both have in the little five hundreds on hand and they're going to run a race in the last four weeks here with that five hundred thousand dollars and they might be able to scrounge up a couple of hundred grand more\nBut if you don't think eight hundred thousand dollars can do some damage a and Planned Parenthood doesn't exactly care about the family values we share here in Alabama\nAnd so they're going to do everything they can to rip apart and destroy the state and the next four weeks I bring all this up to say this\nOr I assume most in our audience will be voting in favor of amendment to I Will be voting in favor of them to on the November ballot I encourage you to vote in favor of it I think uh\nI mean here here's what the Alabama healthy families pack said about the measures that would pave the way to outlaw abortion in all cases including rape incest and when the life of the woman is that ... that's the group against it obviously that's the group against it\nUm but you know what I'm\nWe can talk about that because I I don't think that's true but we can talk about whether or not that's a good thing or bad thing um\n\nBut I'll say this when Planned Parenthood comes in Alabama and spends eight hundred thousand dollars\nThey're gonna do it and the most divisive hate filled disgusting nasty way imaginable they are going to do everything they can\nTo try to harm every single person in Alabama and they're not going to spend eight hundred thousand dollars politely\nWhile I Hope they spend a chunk of that eight hundred thousand dollars on our airwaves because we are a free speech organization as regulated by the FCC and if we're going to be free speech we might as well get paid to do it I Hope plant\nWhat FM W. A. T. V.

cars are part\nOr all over your fences now's the time look we got lucky here in Montgomery, Alabama this thing took a hard right turn as expected rich said from a cold front moving through had it not

dumping three to eight twenty forty for that is the number three to eight twenty four eighty four Tom in August ... ... charm tree service more than Fifteen Years in the business license ensured\nA and and frankly they got a list of reference a mile long including a lot in our audience who have used to watch out for each of us find them on Facebook three to twenty forty four and they have twenty four hours a day seven day a week\nEmergency services [noise] as well All right I was one of my favorite sums it up later the brick\nJanuary wedding baby brothers if you're listening to um\nWhy do I say that they look there there are two things going on right now and go back to when I was talking about before the top of the hour\nBecause in order to understand sort of where the New York times is coming from and where the Washington Post is coming from you really have to understand who they are relying on for their stuff\nYou can you can go back and reread the articles I'm not gonna sit here and summarize for you on air a bunch of articles that are available on line all your Google but you can go back in Google\nThe Washington Post in New York Times stories about roses dynamics and and the cave and all the players and about Trump but everything else and you can get an immediate feel for for who are the people talking to those news organizations and I'm telling you right now it comes down to Rosenstein versus McCain\nAndrew McCabe is trying to stay out of prison the only way he's going to stay out of prison is to try to take Rod Rosenstein down how is he doing it McCain is using the New York Times' McCain is using the New York times the McCain people this is Lisa Page\nJames Baker my core ten pages stroke these folks and we could go on there's more\nFolks are using the New York times to get their story out and that is why the New York times has been sabotaging Rosenstein that is why the New York times printed they're\nAnonymous up in\nRemember the anonymous op ed that in all likelihood could have been fake about the high ranking a\nTrump official who's working from the inside and part of a large team working from the inside to disrupt the president's dangerous agenda you remember this\n[noise]\nIs why they're doing it that is that is McCain's choice outlet to keep the Cape and call me and all these other folks out of prison and that is why you need to understand James bankers testimony the other day testimony there was a there is a great John Solomon peace in the hill yesterday\nA great John Solomon these in the hill yesterday and I read it and I didn't covered on air yesterday really\nI I think I mentioned I don't think I'd have to go back and listen to show actually I don't even know that I mentioned it I printed it off and brought it in but I don't know that I've covered it\n[laughter] and the reason is because I discount what James Baker says I Know his testimony may have been ... explosive behind closed doors it very well may have been and I believe I think John Solomon is a good journalist and I think he did a good thing about trying to get that story out because of James Baker said those things behind closed doors\nThen we need to know about it and one of the things James Baker said was Rod Rosenstein absolutely was serious and it was part of an absolutely serious effort to try to ...\nOr someone record Trump and then go to cabinet officials had Trump removed from office recording the twenty Fifth Amendment\nBut again that's James Baker that team Andrew McCabe that's teen New York times so what James Baker go say all those things yeah those are opinion things those are things that can never be proven incorrect those that you can't that's not a perjury trap\nYou can't go in and and and start saying well your opinion was wrong that's perjury he's saying in his opinion those were legitimate threats from Rosenstein that was a legitimate plan to try to undermine and take out the front of the United states that is what his position was that change makers position now keep in mind\nJames Baker is on the hook\nWith people like Andrew McCabe and James Comey and Bruce or and Peter stroke and Lisa Page or all under investigation James Baker may very well be under that same investigation he may very well be headed to prison with James Comey and Andrew McCabe and Peter stroke and Lisa Page and Bruce or in LA or\nAnd John Carlin and Mary McCord of my core tainted James right baking and more I mean this this is this small group that put this thing together they'll be lucky if the only thing they get his prison there'll be lucky\nIf you if you attempt a coup in most countries in get caught you don't go to prison you go to the gallows or you just lined up and shot and killed after the verdict comes down if there's a verdict at all\nSo if that's what they're facing and that's the New York times they're using as an outlet when you read stories in the New York times or you hear\nTestimony from one of these people in this small group understand their motives why are they trying to throw a Rod Rosenstein under the bus I've taken a lot of backlash from you people including my own mother tax me every time I bring it up and did it again this morning\nLove Yuma\nBut every time I bring it up that Rod Rosenstein is a bad guy and to get off this idea that he's at worst a gray hat and at best a white hat because he's very well may be a black cat I\nI'll I'll give you that'll give you that possibility is a possibility he's a black and he's a bad actor or give you that I'm not seeing evidence of it I'm not see the evidence of it and maybe it's the lawyer than me but I tend to follow the evidence more than I Do rhetoric\nThey only the only rhetoric I say about it is coming from people who have nothing to lose and everything to gain by throwing Rod Rosenstein under the bus\nAnd I go back to that that key piece of evidence he's\nStill employed so is his boss Jeff Sessions who wanted him there to begin with\nAnd so I'm not getting off my theory that this is all a show I'm not yeah getting off my theory that somehow Rod Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions have pulled off one of the greatest psychological operations ever unleashed on the United states I'm not getting off of that yet\nNow I've been involved in a lot of campaigns in my professional career\nA small campaigns big campaigns and and and everything in between\nThe one thing you never know what your opponent is going to do you almost never know what your opponents going to do so what you can do is you make educated guesses the type of hits they're likely to put on you how you would respond you go ahead and get your talking points ready you ahead and see your\nUm your friendly news outlets and you you try to do your best to anticipate what's gonna happen but you never really know what's gonna happen you also try to find out the worst your opponent has to offer\nYou look for things like a opposition research you talked to anybody and everybody can\nEr and you hope that you can do it quietly without your opponent finding out about it but if they find out about it that that's cool too because it rattles I'm a little bit and let them know you're talking to everybody\nOr you know when you're calling a a a ten year old a ... a girlfriend from ten years ago you're doing your dirty you're doing you're due diligence you're doing you're due diligence so um when they know that they get a little off of their game [noise]\nSo those are kind of the big broad strokes that's what's going on in the campaign imagine if you had access to the phones\nOf the other campaign not just the phone records but actually listening to the phone calls imagine if you had access to their emails you had access to all of their traveled GPS where they were at any given time everybody associated with the campaign\nImagine if you had law enforcement setting up members of the other side to get warrants to get even more than access you would almost believe you couldn't lose wouldn't you I mean if if you have\nAccess to everything on the other side where you don't have to make any guesses you're seeing their debate preparation near saying their media strategy you're seeing their appearances and who they're talking to and who they're dealing with you could begin to undermine those appearances\n\nCan get in touch with people and have them lead them a stray and imagine if you had the FBI setting them up on the other side holy mackerel that's like the and that's what was going on before Rod Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions were sworn into office that was being led by Andrew McCabe and James Comey\nThat was being led out of that wing of the FBI\nThat's what was happening\nAnd the deputy director the FBI were leading this operation\n\nAnd Jeff Sessions was just a senator from Alabama who was a surrogate going around talking on behalf of the Trump Administration from time to time and Rod Rosenstein was just a career professional plodding along\nHe wasn't involved in it wasn't in on a small group\nI've given you the name several times a day that people who were really in a small group FBI special agents Lisa pay a Peter stroke and if an FBI lawyer Lisa Page the OJ official Bruce or and his wife Nelly or\nJames Baker the chief of staff you got a lot of these people that were the head of these divisions Mary McCord and James ... John Carlin you have a lot of these people who were in on it\nOn the FBI side and a few on the deal Jay sides of the national security division\n\nAnd I'm just gonna say\nFor the sake of argument that Rod Rosenstein was not in on it ahead of time\n\nSo let's make a demarcation point January twenty two thousand Seventeen noon ... Donald Trump takes office\nThe lot of those people are still in place while Donald Trump is president United States Jeff Sessions won't be sworn in for a few more weeks a couple of months actually maybe a month and a half um Rod Rosenstein will be sworn until after that\n\nAnd say you have the enemy who was working to defeat you who was working to monitor you now running free inside the very departments you're about to take over\nJeff Sessions gets sworn in Rod Rosenstein gets sworn in and now their job is to figure out how to de wrest control of the department of justice away from these people meanwhile there are very legitimate operations going on drug dealers terrorism\nI I mean\nFor fraud against the United states brought against the government there are a lot of things that go on at the FBI and the department of justice investigate and you can't just stop everything fire everybody well you could some days I feel like they should\nBut you but but what I understand they're thinking you come in as February twenty Seventeen President Trump's new you don't want to shut down the FBI is the first official act of officers [noise]\nThat might raise a few eyebrows especially what everyone things you're under investigation\nBut you have to figure out how do we continue the operations that are legitimate and investigate the operations that are illegitimate well if the other side knows you're investigating them they change their behaviors so one way you could do that is to sort of go along with that it's happening anyway\nBy virtue of your position you're going to have to sign some documents from time to time\nOne way to go along with it to continue to investigate it\nIs to go along with a design those documents if you don't sign if someone is in a moment you refused to sign it you you tip everybody off the jury you're on the other side and they start changing their behavior and they start going after you know keep in mind is a pretty fancy and powerful tools in our intelligence community\nYou don't necessarily want them after you remembered Chuck Schumer is warning\nThey got six ways from Sunday and get back at you this is not the\nPeople you want to piss off until you got full control over the organization I think that's what Rod Rosenstein and just sessions found themselves when they got\nI don't buy the Patsy argument necessarily I I think that's the word that's where I go to great ... that's the worst case scenario is that Rod Rosenstein of twenty plus year veteran of the department of justice rising to the absolute pinnacle of as a part of his position there's only one position ahead of him\nRod Rosenstein\nI don't think is an idiot I think he's probably quite brilliant and I don't think he walked into a situation where he's just a dumb idiot you know I'm there to well past due to the to do [laughter] I don't think the Trump people think that I think they're putting out that message through their friendly channels to try to get people off the case\nBut I don't think Rod Rosenstein said Patsy at all\nNor do I think he was a willing participant in the effort to undermine the Trump Administration he wasn't there\nUntil after January twenty until Trump was an officer the two phases of there's there's the early phase and the late face the early phase Rosenstein wasn't even there that was candidate Trump they were going after and then eventually president elect Trump roses dies not they're not in a small group it gets in the small group by virtue of his appointment to there be all their bosses basically\nOn the the OJ side and the the OJ runs that the ... runs the FBI I mean that's something people lose track of their cross the street or you go to Washington DC ones on the right hand side ones on the left hand side there's a avenue running right down the middle of it\n\nBut if you put yourself in Rosenstein in session shoes you want to investigate this because you're loyal to the Trump Administration you want to ferret out corruption inside the department of justice and the FBI\nBut you just got there and there's this whole snazzy operation that you don't even know how deep it went and who all was involved you don't know who up there you can trust you got to investigate this how do you do it you do it from the inside you do it from the inside you say things like\nYou know guys we are taped this guy take 'em out that's what we ought to do we have to get his cabinet officials to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment take 'em out Sessions is on but he'll do I bet we could get Ben Carson he said some nasty things about Carson's along the way Rick Perry\nI thought we could I bet we could pull these guys along you know a Nikki Haley she's a she's a global is corporate if she's one of us\nAnd you figure out who's on your team and who's not\nI Can't think of a better way to do it you don't go into these organizations with a wrecking ball and start knocking down walls doesn't work that way the world doesn't work that way and if you did it you would be found out they would seal up and play 'em up the investigation will go nowhere\nTrump would be in office eight years and then and then life goes on in the right back to the same shenanigans and they're still there for the twenty twenty campaign doing what they were doing\nThey have access to all the same database is you know the Pfizer want wasn't what gave them access to the Trump Administration they already had access that's what people don't understand that's what gets lost in\nThe federal government has access to spy on all your electronic communications every step of the way every day anytime they want\nThe only thing stopping them from doing it is they don't know who you are and they don't give a damn about you

acting like the embassy employees\nWell the embassy employees were told to leave so there was nobody uh at the at the consulate when uh this team arrived in\nSaudi Arabia has our uh uh the cameras all around ... arriving and then a right before and right after this team showed up at the airport in a distant ball in two separate airplanes\nThat uh one team went to the embassy if they knew when he was they don't even need to be there one thirty\nOne came arrived there before one team arrived there afterwards according to the tapes um security cameras so\nUh it does appear that they had evolved ... shelves or when you went into the consulate and again nobody here state and come back out ... back that he was murdered his remains to dispose of\nThat is absolutely amazing so do they oh so it was some intelligence on our part now we intercepted some ... about Saudis about basically meeting up with this guy and that could have been just code for what they're doing\nHow does the U.S has handled this I mean there's this seems I mean you have a Washington Post joined gr reporter he actually resigned his home and do you and it said how do you um\nHow do you look the same as when something like this\nWell the president has said he's going to speak to Saudi Arabia about this or I presume he will it puts the United states in a difficult quandary\nAbout ... to turkey and Saudi Arabia ... difficult relations anyway and there's only makes it seem worse that\nUh that show that he had a had gone destined bold aired his marriage a papers pretty marriage certificate so what happens on the Turkish soil the a team if it was that arrives and apparently carries out\nA a possible murder or in a in Turkey elderly tactically Saudi territory in the conflict but nevertheless there's the marriage thing or two to turkey which offered a ... a certain amount of freedom which is unusual for journalists and turkey\nUm turkey is a NATO ally a Saudi Arabia has established a particular friendship with the crop administration a president went to Saudi Arabia for his first foreign trip or he has a son in law a direct cautionary has gone to\nSaudi Arabia and established to protect her friendship with the crown prince uh\nUm Mohammed bin Solomon who some believe is responsible for the border to assassinate a ... so it it's a difficult situation for the United states and you're probably not a whole lot that the u._s. can do\nA I expect Saudi Arabia was a real penchant for secrecy is never going to acknowledge what happened\nOr it'll remain a big question mark for a long time\nWhen the phone with us is Dr Davis orange the middle east so square and we're talking about the possible assassination of a a journalist or in Turkey\nSo is the is the Saudi royal family particularly this nuclear plants is he then arrogant that ... that ... it would have to do one of them have become from him wouldn't it\nYes it it is impossible to believe that this was simply a row hit squad nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the permission of the king and the crown prince ...\nIn fact probably the most powerful person in a in Saudi Arabia he didn't say a he's got a check her reputation he he is on the one hand culprit maternity\nHe said women can dry women can vote and yet the rest of the very people who called for women to be able to drive there stolen in either house arrest or jail\nHe arrested a ... a coterie of ah\nMembers of the royal family including some of his own family accused of corruption or so it's a very mixed record but Saudi Arabia is made it very clear that there will be no criticism of the ... or the royal family and this may be the most recent case because\nA macho he has been interesting record of\nBoth being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood uh interviewed a lot and um but it's also been very critical of the year of the royal family been critical of Saudi Arabia in a policy outside the country critical of the war in Yemen\nAre in very critical of internal policies including the rest so\nUh it may be a prince Mohammed bin ... among decided that enough is enough for this opportunity to ah to silence yeah\nWell if if you so it sounds seen him but his own some trying to send a message to other journalist so therefore they I mean I Would think that logically people would realize just when it come out\nYes well he was a Saturday says in his family are actually his family to the reason for the interesting name is not an Arab Emirates actually purchased name his family came from turkey many many many years ago but here's the Saudi Arabians citizen he was actually born in but they now he's been in and out of the country he went to ...\nIn terms of uh in Houston Bowl or throw you very very wealthy family or his cousin who was ... was internationally known about arms dealer who also was involved in a bit of corruption\nOne of his relatives were ... people were just the person ... Princess Diana when she died in the car accident so it's a it's a well known family it's in the international apparently took very wealthy family um and and that the\nCrown prince decided to take on a such a well known family or says a lot about the disparity has control over the country\nNeeds that ... that he's going to say to a relationship with Trump that Trump would do anything\nThat's the suspicion and that's what the Washington Post has a has their pants that in some ways uh the President Trump may have empowered or the or the royal family that are there he's got there it back in and they won't do anything\nThink the reality is that he he really doesn't matter who the president is Saudi Arabia is not going to uh let anybody interfere in what they regard as a an internal matter even though it happened to enter into other countries so\nI suspect that even to President Trump put pressure on on the on the family could say you've got to come clean on there's got to tell us where it happened uh I got pretty much I think again it this is one of the most secretive countries in the world ... North Korea so\nI doubt very much that we're going to learn very much about\nHow is this the equivalent of their\nIntelligence community do CIA and is actually a hit squads within their own decision [noise] oh I\nHave not seen the the identity of of the people in terms of their organization that I've seen a few names or I don't recognize them as being a part of their Superman colonel security um systems in Saudi Arabia the national guard as one of them but they're\nAlso a member of other internal security they're mostly civilian agencies are and they report directly to the crown prince they really don't work for the country they worked for the crown prince and the and the whale family even though I guess you could argue everybody in Saudi Arabia\nAre working for the royal family because it is now the rabies and but\nMy sense is that this is probably a very small highly secretive group that Saddam is based in in Riyadh and uh get there on the workers of the uh the crown prince\nWe have a big orange new that we sign with him last year you seem to be in jeopardy\nNo I think that there is so much support for that arms deal that uh I think it is almost bullet proof\nOne interesting at about ... buy arms as they they don't learn something from how Americans by armed tape learn something about ah how Israelis by our and\nMake sure that the contracts are spread out through out the country so the beneficiaries took the Saudi Arabian orange dealer a dealer in Arizona there soda there in California in just enough electoral districts so that there's\nPlenty of political support for this uh the ills that Saudi Arabia has done over the past five years total over a hundred billion dollars and they're pretty some pretty fancy things that um again give a lot of jobs to ah to American so I think that even the of\nSaudi Arabia to say yeah I'll be killed him what are you going to do about it uh I don't think that the arms deal would really be in jeopardy there's just way too much political support for it\nIs absolutely amazing because it seems that the president's gonna have to do something here but\nSo quickly and done and uh the secretive away it's not official actions by nations it's a lot of these special operations\nAnd there's a lot of jockeying for position [noise]\nKind of scary yeah the Trump in a bad situation to tell you that I'm gives curb dissent in those kind of unusual talking about the cab they Kevin uh allegations here there's such an end to this\nOne by the way my barnacles allegations against the Supreme Court nominee that\nUh\nFive ten years ago most likely would not have may preempt a unsubstantiated allegations on one side and\nThen on the other side and I'm Talking about the stories that followed Dr brown story which would have been much stronger if had her doctor story would have been much stronger if Dr Ford story would have stood alone instead of\nUnsubstantiated claims that followed a stream of them but also on the other side Mike let me ask you what New York times reporter Washington Post reporter was assigned a story\nBy their editors to go see what really happened when Dianne Feinstein and fines died and her staff said the sort of questions that would have happened if the Republican Party has done the same thing not one and I and I\nFor his editors I challenge the Washington Post editors I challenged Wall Street journal editors I challenge editors across America\nHappened with Dr forms agreement or with a congresswoman or with Diane Feinstein\nWhy did they link that story and more importantly look at yourself and ask yourself the question why did we report on this in real time when sure as hell would have reported on it if Grassley\nAnd his office had done the same thing\nThere and he's absolutely right it yeah I don't agree with Joe Scarborough very often but he uh he did come out and that was a good thing to do can you pull that clip budget sent you a ... you take ... seconds you take your time\n\nBut I ... was was going on with this thing\nYeah and it's a sometimes filter of Ebola boat here does I Can't be such over ah for the Democrats and the Democrats do\nLook bad here who I was if it was time Feinstein herself for some of their off as what they did and how they handled it was thinking political first instead of actually following the facts of the case they're looking to score points and it does a disservice to the larger cultural moment we're having with\nA sexual assault and awareness because instead of really treating this if she is a victim and chief incredible ... Ford was kind of do respect in confidentiality it made her point in this big political good well\nAnd it did a disservice to her when she used to do is they are totally ... which he went through and said how painful it was and and everything to be doing that and put in the public and there was certainly avoidable totally aboard that\nThere's actually a a house of cards episode I Can't remember which season we're color of the ... river president Underwood wife at the un parts of the time trying to get somebody to come and speak to Congress who's a victim of sexual assault and she at the last second says no I'm not going in front of the committee\nAnd like Claire threatens er and tries to a storm and it it's weird how out of the fictional stories that are a little exaggerated a you still see these real life thing so people get chewed up in this system where they have no real feelings real stories are real people and yet we're still playing politics at the end of the day\nCame we pick up this clip I just think it was centered opponent winter to stop and go here or he's going to turn out to asking are being asked about the uh the Saturday the journalists that was a allegedly murdered and dismembered and a ...\nBrand new video just release of what Turkish media are calling and assassination squad the Fifteen member group believed to be linked to the murder of us

blocking us arms sales to Saudi Arabia Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and joins us now if they're killing our journalist I think it's only right the president's got Korea relations with the ... should be more aggressive [noise]\nYeah I've been calling for some time because for over a couple of years now we've been supporting the Saudi efforts bombing in Yemen over ten thousand civilians have died but now that the Saudis\nHere to be involved with the killing of a journalist I think we shouldn't be selling them weapons we shouldn't be aiding and abetting what they're doing in Yemen and uh yeah signal needs to be sad I mean if we send signals to other countries that misbehave\nCertainly we should send signals to ally that this is unacceptable for sure but one of the people on our team who sends signals the other night\nIt was yesterday she's resigning are just curious how your reaction to the news because her a you know she says it's time for me to go people are speculating why there might be some other reason behind it then the last ah she's done a pretty good job for the administration hasn't she [noise]\nYou know I think what we need to think about us who the president should pick and I think the president should pick somebody who agrees with the president's vision to the Iraq\nWar was a mistake that the Afghan war is coming to a close that there is no military solution in Afghanistan so I really want somebody to come forward to the president will pick that actually agrees with the president's vision for foreign policy who is that [noise]\n[laughter] that's a good question but ah I think that\nMany of the people surrounding him give him the advice that we must stay forever in Afghanistan they are now saying we must stay forever in Syria they're saying we must stay forever and Africa that we must stay forever and yeah and so I'm Out the AMA those opinion we need to have a strong national defense we need to balance our budget or we don't need to get everybody out of a war I think further I raised with thing while\nIncomes ISIS for leave Afghanistan outcomes\n... and then building start falling here so he got to be responsible well the the other half of\nBy now as we went into Afghanistan we toppled the regime and I we went into Iraq\nTopple the regime there and guess what it made Iran stronger so really we tip the balance of power in favor of Iran when we went into Iraq so we have to think of the unintended consequences of always intervening and everyone's civil war only don't always intervene everyone's civil war well were\nSeven and civil wars right now and I'm particularly the Yemen's civil war came on\nRussia and the middle east and tell you there's Seventeen million people in Yemen living on the edge of starvation\nThey had the largest cholera outbreak oil and maybe on his style aiding the rebels well this is because the Saudis or block ... when we are aiding and

still fertile [laughter]\nI got so I'm going to get right to keep it out and tonight but I wanted to share stories with you about you know what you were saying about moving here you know I'm originally from here going home tonight where I was born ...\nAt the right I Know I\nKnow what the thing after leaving and fifty three and coming back in Seventy nine and I have enjoyed my stay in Montgomery, Alabama I met some of the most wonderful people progressive thinking you know what I use that\nAre in a legitimate term not necessarily politically right you just got some people that are on it and what you're saying is true I'm Stuart with you are back in Nineteen eighty three I was up in Boston I\nThink it was eighty three and it was either the ah Emery and I'm a who was the uh Emery fall more in a George Wallace were running for governor\nThink it was yeah and I was the Alabama delicate you know there was twenty seven of us we're going through some corporate training\nAnd everybody looked at me like\nWhat are you all do it and I called bam you elected George Wallace so I became the spokesperson for I guess I don't know I didn't know how to deal with that and I really didn't understand what was going on that much I yeah I had been back here maybe two or three years and it's kind of avoided politics go\nBut um I had to justify the citizens of Alabama especially is black citizens voted for George Wallace and that was simple it was really really strange you know try what am I going to say that these people you know a a first of all I work for him [laughter]\nAnd you know they they put me on the hot seat but you know this we uh we're in all of it you know we we don't have first so we don't have any of that crap you very little brutality\nOf the over the forty years that I've been back here you know you have incidents but we deal with it and we we can continue to deal with it you know spend time with your mother on the board of directors of the chamber of commerce\nI've watched it happened it on and we we need to keep moving moving in that direction you know we were a lot of things going on and we need to build on it and just enjoying your show\nWhile we're there pushing I really appreciate your phone call and good luck with your new location\n[laughter] nice has a bad connection there um\nLet's go to Wendy yes when do you what what was it a motion\nHey Dan thank you for taking my call absolutely I have a question too\nThough are we supposed to adhere to see something say something or are we supposed to assume that even though some\nOut of play or looks a little bit like it you know we think maybe it shouldn't look are we supposed to just accept that is okay\nEspecially when they were actually win question it's we're new but when you say ... see something say something if what you're seeing is a bug I were to white people and that is odd to you you need to ask you to have one or two you\nWell that's true but at the same time why why do we even think that it might be um something that's not good I mean it because these things happen and it doesn't it it's not necessarily a race thing that I'm I'm not coming at it from that direction I mean across\nThe board are we supposed to are we supposed to\nAsk question if something looked at a play are we supposed to just ignore everything I mean I it's a\nFine line I understand that but it's it's a very slippery slope that we're headed down\nWell I I think you know asking questions is fine and you guys are you didn't apply way um you know gosh ... to ... who right and yeah and\nThere there's really no way there's really no way to to even approach it\nThat that's not going to hurt feelings or you know make somebody to fit that it would certainly make me defensive Iran that that your way but you also have to realize that\nWhere this is where we live these are the things that happened and this is where we live and if I'm not doing anything wrong and you know explain a fine and I know that kind of a Pollyanna attitude I get that but it's just I\nDon't even understand I don't even know where we're supposed to draw the line\nWell as soon as I think there's a tie for

Larry Shepard was the um the University of Virginia political science guy that um you see a mono box we now he seems to be doing a lot of gigs zone MSNBC this was from um\nMeet the press daily with Chuck Todd that they do a show at four o'clock central time for one hour a day candidates as political wound up so he was own it\nAnd Chuck Todd ... set up as trying to be a very distinguished kind of political um gourmet type person but totally messed up on the twenty sixteen election is to Larry Sabato but ... admits that he miss a chart doesn't necessarily\nAdmit that so let's talk about you're gonna be talking about at the very beginning here the mid term elections\nAir one street didn't strike me when you see him going to western Iowa\nYes there is part of the third congressional district there you see I'm going to the places Erie, Pennsylvania\nHe's going to places that matter to him in twenty twenty it appears more so than the candidates themselves it was like this whole week really is testing the reelect week\nWill ... this is a president who filed for reelection or the day was an operator for the first term we we've never seen anything like this from from a president so he's been running flat out his reelection campaign is running flat out\nAnd I think they know that or even if the Republicans hold the Senate given the very pro Republican map and exist or President Trump is in trouble and some of these states he's fallen considerably ah in approval and the the Midwest as a whole\nSeems to be flipping in the in the uh a midterm year of all the states that he carried are getting ready it appears\nTo either elect Democratic senators or Democratic governors or both\nNow I\nCan in a way disagree with that I think we're just trying to do is to me ruin porn boo sample he's going to Kansas to a ... he went in for the guy who's running for governor who he endorsed and who had endorsed him but that's important because that state is going to be making 'em\nDecisions as far as I'm\nDifferent a reduced to ... and things like that so I think he's doing that I think he's also trying to cherry picked I'm not sure how effective is going to be hitting a media markets in a competitive race that you have a Republican that could lose and you're trying to show him up a little bit so\nI think it's kind of just say that he's going into Iowa up or I Would say versus that um that congressional district is in Council Bluffs and then next door to it when you're in that comes to blow up media market having been there many a time\nWell to each other so I'm not sure if I agree with the uh the philosophy of this but let's continue um\nYou know it's interesting it's the one part of the quote wave that has gotten less attention I mean we made it or leave given it a lot of attention we made it or leave today in first grade as sort of the Big Ten states\nThat was ... important to Brock Obama's election in reelection um it's what he how he held off Mitt Romney and it was hugely important in Donald Trump's when\nIt appears to be tariffs if I were to if you were to find an issue that seems to their their sort of it even though you talk to Trump voters anecdotally and they say they're not judging him yet\nWhich you can't help but notice that as he threatened tariffs on the terrorists got put in Republican numbers started eroding and those Midwest particularly the agricultural Midwestern states\nNo I think that's right because after all those terrorists seem to be hurting people in the mid west more than other regions and nothing forget another factor\nOr many of those Midwestern states as we know because we we do a lot\nUh they are the nice part of America I'm not going to this New York or California but you don't get the time of day for people there are the mid westerners may not react as well to some of those things that President Trump says and does and I think you pointed out this morning and the first reduce letter this also reminds us that\nTwenty sixteen was a choice it was simply that people decided to vote for Donald Trump in a vacuum many of them were voting against Hillary Clinton right maybe you dispute the ah the premise of it but it's actually it's it's a two prong that decision\nAnd I agree with that part that they that um I think\nPeople were voting for Hillary Clinton and they were looking the other way for some things for her don't Trump but I'm not sure\nThat that that was that big of a deal to them that they that\nThat was a large number I think there were some women that didn't like Hillary Clinton and so they're holding their nose and voting for Donald Trump but how many of those people are either not going to vote or actually on a boat in the Democratic side that at the ledger\nI'm not sure that that we're in a city that let me a couple of things here one done Duncan on American tier two locations of Madison Avenue one ... road and then the new location in ... way behind the McDonalds and\nHighway fourteen go see Mike there is a personal friend of mine but everybody in old Don Duncan locations are spectacular I Need to go back I got to get my luck nut\nA little key sooner you get that in and take them in give them a charge will get the brakes check because it does feel different and they will tell me exactly what's wrong with it and they will not over charge me or do work is unnecessary\nThat is one reason I really really really like Don Duncan on Americans are going on and say by the way it was like hurricane Michael is now going to touch the very bottom of Alabama why did the dos and when you go down to Marianna, Florida is going to hit that and why did at the corner\nAs which said where Georgia Alabama and Florida oh joined there together this is going to be right there is a dose and if you've got folks down to do than they are going to do so in any we bought one they're more show will be back right after that\n\nYou were listening to the damn Morris you're on TALK Ninety three point one W. H. T. V. [noise]\nPeople are changing sides they're very few persuadable especially in a midterm election round instead\nThis is the party's reaching people who are very likely to turn out if they're energized\nWhat is it [noise] one of ... can can ... as you noted look President Trump is sort of blown up norms and conventional wisdom well nothing could blow up conventional wisdom more if we truly have\nA two Americas style election many Democrats win forty house seats in somehow Republicans gained in the Senate now it's a geographical ... you could call it a geographical anomaly in the Senate races but I have to tell you I Am struggling to figure out how\nThey would pick up forty house seats that not at least being neutral in the Senate\nWell it is tough until you look at the at the map it's the worst map either party has faced since we started popular elections for the Senate over a century ago\nSo I can see how it will happen and and interestingly the academic models predict these elections and they did much better than the stuff they did in twenty sixteen uh they're they're predicting just that the Democrats will pick up a lot of house seats some say in the twenties some say in the thirties goes up to forty four seats\nAt the same time they're saying Republicans will keep the Senate and maybe even as a senior too\nAnd that's [noise] that's how much data\nBut did you notice how tired couldn't come to realization that that could actually happen right having just gonna I don't see how you can get forty seeds and not be net neutral in the industry\nSees what he wants to see ... I go ... go home every day and watch uh meet the press daily and I just listen to how he always\nMeaning if the person they they spin the first twenty minutes that Trump is doing something wrong and its own traditions and how bad it is but it never really gets down to that bad particularly when you look at the the new polls out their own um\nOwn popularity ratings and wind direction type deal a matter of fact Steve ... going to be talking about that and that is a first base that we have here\nBut not nomination fight Brett Kavanaugh and now\nAn associate justice on the Supreme Court is that too is wearing the the the sort of a unofficially official one behind closed doors any of the ceremonial one last night so Kavanaugh is now on the Supreme Court Republicans are saying they they think and they didn't expect this going in and they think\nThat the fight over this has energized their voters remember we've been at this board all year telling you there's been this enthusiasm gap between the two parties while it was measured at about a ten point\nEnthusiasm gap over the summer there was a poll last week that showed that falling down to two points so that's one factor Republicans say they finally got the energy do they have it will last what about the Trump factor in all of this Donald Trump's approval rating right now\nAgain it sits there if you average all the polls together this is an interesting one let's see if this tool works at least forty three point six percent is Trump's average approval rating\nThe interesting thing on this is before the calving off like a couple of weeks ago when we were talking about Cohen and Manafort in the McCain funeral from supporting was about three points lower than this he bottomed out I think in the average at forty point two so he's actually going up about three three and a half points remember Republicans have been saying\nThe closer that number is that Trump approval rating ... forty five to the mid forties the better they feel about actually hanging on to the house the more it gets in the low forties the more breaks into the high thirties the better Democrats feel about that blue wave forming so that's the big picture for weeks out the question is Kevin ... the question is energy\nThe question is Trump's approval rating has that been rebounding why might that be rebounding\nNow there's a rolling average by the way that he's talking about is at forty three and they said was at forty so\nWhat what I've learned and looking at ... the trend is your friend and would you do is not look at the last six to look at the last three and then when you look in the last three instead of forty three Europe at forty six\nAnd ... that trend going just stay stay where he is and it was a story just stay right there and I think you're going and I think these guys are doing to themselves I agree based on the debt I'm saying we're going to lose houses no doubt about it to me\nThe question is how many are we at the twenty number where the forty number or somewhere in between in between in good for\nRepublicans and they're gonna lose a house and that's going to be message to say the ...\nI think is also going to spend you know what happens in three weeks\nI think getting the day OJ\nInvestigations the algae report and those kinds of things going to be really important because if you want to do something that the Democrats want to do something to damage making it very glaring\nReport that you cannot ignore and then go in and shut that down because here's where nothing will happen\nI think you literally could\nThe house the Dems could take the house and all those dams that said that they were not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi ended up voting for Nancy Pelosi you've got a glaring information out there saying that yes there were a group of people within the department of justice is trying to stop candidate Trump interests\nAnd then the Dems are going to go shut that down because those two factors right there those two factors I think you'd make it where you win back the house and twenty twenty\nHow 'bout that poor production how really\nThing that can happen particularly if you get the economy going into the wind direction which speaking of which one thing that are known Trump is really been banking known in touting his the stock market we're down seven hundred and forty six point to where it now yes that's a big number of folks\nAnd it's going across the board that's the down but even\nWhen you look at the as some people have hundred is donated to aid but the NASDAQ is down two hundred and Seventy two and it's roughly a third of a it's like thirty eight percent of the Dow Jones but he's been banking on that and that's not helping them out when you talk about their\n... going up and everybody's happy well when you have a week that you've taken down basically Thirteen fourteen hundred points on the down\nAs a big number and I tell you the other thing is going to happen that's going to be a major news story is going to be the tornado hurricane but they're going to be talking about this those two factors here can you pull back up a connection and in\nThis play a little bit more of this year's hosts or take a walk or shouldn't give me a ... um well we'll get into this and this is having to do as a rising interest rates right yeah ... you know Russian interests where his is definitely a factor in what's happened is people are moving\n... market come into semi read into bonds you are just changing the portfolio over but when you change a couple of a trillion dollars that's a good habit in back as continue on here\nI I Want to four weeks out or essentially one month out from election day I'm big picture view of where this election is the conventional wisdom all year has been the Democrats are favored are likely to sort of had a house of maybe the senators even play to a map you either right let me just start with you\nYou actually feel right now that if the election were held today Republicans would hold the house\nI I think the houses are increasingly out of reach for Republicans and the ... even with the Kevin thing I think so and we have to remember with Kavanaugh they're still four weeks to go\nAnd we woke up this morning oh everyone is talking about the ceremony to Kevin ceremony last night and then what's the big news ... so the idea that Kavanaugh is going to last a month I think uh it's kind of spurious and the Republicans shouldn't be too overconfident that that this enthusiasm\nAttached to capping off is going to last there's more general enthusiasm I think Republicans are finally tuning in and that explains I think some of the clothes and got\nIn on that point actually let's play a little bit of the sound here we have Mitch McConnell and and this is sort of the message it sounds like emerging from the Kavanaugh fight that Republicans think they can kind of harness that they can run on for the home stretch the idea that there was a mob to get\nKavanaugh and not to get a sort of the Trump on this one plus play with McConnell had to say after this nomination fight [noise] while the\nPeople that were attacking our members of their homes and in the hall ... um it was a really quite a display of aggressive does a far beyond a but I Would consider peaceful protesting though they were trying to intimidate members of the Senate\nI'm not only in our home a stage but also up here are actually in in the capital\nAnd at our homes here in Washington and I'm really proud of my members are not lock going out or the or those kind of ...\nWhat do you think of that message encourage a lot like tactics are uh really I mean he's considering it when democracy elements that are right now in practice I passed away last week I was there I felt some of the events that was that one\nAnd I say no to save it their mom that peace will protesting and democracy at work if it's ... for Jay hang on

nine ... an hour winds at ... air force base in a hundred and thirty miles per hour at Mexico beach absolutely incredible and then there's the storm surge problem which is still ongoing now\nIn places

wrecking ball um\nHe needed a we needed a wrecking ball and he may be more than I mean Ronald Reagan said you weren't here in the seventies I was and it was a very the last few years in the seventies were very difficult time\nYou know you're talking about credit card level interest rates on homes Morris has touched on them or just kept going up for medicine bank\nAnd there was you know they called the the word that became synonymous with Jimmy Carter was ma lays but why did he get elected in the first place because he was dead for any wars sweaters and walked instead of riding a crap\n\nHe was a horrible president\nAnd see\nWe live in a world where the other countries that want it damages they they know how to smell blood and the water has been guys he was the Iranian hostage thing lasted four hundred and forty relations with the Democrats\nThe two thousand twelve Obama Benghazi fiasco is just a lie that continues to be told\nAnd nobody nobody has been held accountable for that the lies that went on Susan Rice who she to judge Kavanaugh was she went on a network TV parade the couple of days later so Alabama the you know video just accompany line\nFrom the biggest liars that I've ever occupy the White House\nUm\nAt the same kind of economy it just never know when you went nowhere it got worse\nSo what do we elect weigh like ... and Carter always seemed ambivalent about everything including love of country and Reagan comes along with the flag and uh you know some serious tough talk you're doing very good job as governor of California\nShe California stop electing people like him and now they have Governor Brown for the second time\nAnd what's going on out there is beyond and saying you know you can get to that crap\nBecause yeah liberals being the open minded dreamers that they are\n\nHosting a bunch of wealth in that city but in their socialistic ways want to make it fair so they allow people to set up homeless camps in downtown areas and well there's no restroom facility so just crap in the street was somebody coming clean it up for that civilization [noise] well I thought that ended and the nineteenth century\nAnd it really is a housing thing and you it's we're talking about just California here in Tokyo had is that on real growth in the last fifty years and population growth is one of the wealthiest places on earth now amazing victory and the success story for free markets and and trade\nBut Tokyo's housing prices have not gone up at the same clip and say San Francisco other places in California\nScott twenty fourteen Tokyo issued permits for about a hundred and forty two thousand new housing units in contrast the entire state of California which has three times the population of Tokyo issued permits for only eighty three thousand new housing units [noise] so what's happening is the government's out there\nTo a degree local governments will do this was voting but the government's out there in California are artificially limiting how much housing there is\nTo keep up the price of their housing and that's that creates a homeless problem and now you have a snap crap\nYeah but you know ... one reason why builders what the hurdles that the government is put in front of them are old anything out there\nIt's not worth it and then if they do it they've got to charge an extraordinarily high rate to create the property to make it pay off so that drives up the cost of rent and everything else\nAnd the biggest problem California has and I got to say I say it again\nI Would have moved there in a heartbeat in the seventies I loved it out there it was such a ... at this giant city with mountains and now you're close to the ocean\nAnd the uh the entertainment district for the record companies were\nHollywood Sign and all that

an honest mistake was delivering you know I don't know I don't know if it's been delivered\nOr not just showed that is what I was trying to paint before all of you just went straight to the gutter gets in Illinois which talk once you get right into the tournament era so last week we had Thirteen Ghosts beat the conjuring which I feel\nThat was appropriate it was the only appropriate but it was okay\nI can barely appropriate men were on notice here ... only put on bladder by now and my show generally and you can tell me to leave at any time I don't want to be read no actually Emily and I told you this earlier all fair I Want to you on the program tonight because you actually get me a little while\nAnd we've had people you know giving feedback on the book faces all day to expect more feedback I'm a little disappointed with all the ... out there now\nToo many hats and so many [laughter] anyway evil ... to his house of a thousand ... before I give my opinion I Want to give it up to the room so who would like to go first\nI'll go okay what's up or I I don't even I did too for me it was a comedy yeah and it's I don't really if I go immediately to house for a thousand courts is because I don't ... um if if I laugh at it\nIn in a funny way then I don't consider it a horror movie\nOh\nGee I Wonder your question and given the nature has evil that too is explicitly set out to be a comedy or right\nThere are no scary moments in eagle to to do oh\nI'm not I'm not saying that\nIt for like subject expensing for me\nOkay house with housing for ... that's your that's your choice that's what you would choose to go on you know how about you know a little bit to all day man all day when they go in the basement with\nOld aunt ah ah what's her name but I gave her a hall man becomes the long months yeah Ali is all yeah okay that was a little\n... it was an eighties man when he went down in the basement and they were moving the the the shower curtains and the noises and the water dripping and got a chainsaw running may not get the crap out of me when I was like five\nWho cares [laughter] exactly when you were five\nOkay Emily I don't want you to bail out of this one I as let's say ... has nine to watch a movie tonight\nI've not watched them although I have three I don't know enough about either one of them and therefore I don't know that I Am qualified to offer an opinion it's fine\nI'm saying we're putting it to you tonight we're watching one of these two movies\nWhich one do you want to hear the evil that two evil ... to ... thousand corks\nProbably houses housing courses because I didn't hate what Rob Zombie did to Halloween I'm One of those didn't hate it okay but\nI Know I got to go over and I just get burned out on\nToo much for what am I think that I think when you\nJust it's to gloss over that you can't\nWrite very well um okay ... or the composition of the film is a lot of like the shots even who was not that gory but there were spots where you get like a Nick and you bleed in the room fills up of blood\nOkay that was there was a little bit cooler looks like we can have a I mean it's my show so I'm going to decide what goes forward but uh [laughter] that's right jelly yeah put my foot down but um my choice of I'd watch a movie tonight between the two evils that too and house of a thousand corpses would be evil dead to\nAll day every day because it is I like the genre I liked that they made the first one evil dead and went\nOn a do over I like this is we're kind of clunky sequel or they even change how the first movie ends with the the flashback it's not even really a sequel it's it's more like a parody of the ... this is why I Love it\nThis is why I like that it's taking I don't know it it's humorous and it still can be like um like to see\nThem working everything in the house in laughing all off and ... it's a kind of like ... it's not gory land but it's like how long if you had to watch that scene over and over again you would go insane and I think it's I green lamp when it starts laughing\nThat's where I think of when I go downstairs and his office he's got one of the Greenland all the ... yeah\nYeah ... oh man I Swear it makes me think of that maybe just projected that owns that are on the air and my own crazy I'm Crazy heart I Swear to the Greenland down there ... there than there is of anchors lamp down oh man that's a lot of Islam\nGreen lamp and a dear lab and also we paired these too because they are part of a larger French fries and I have to say if I'm picking out\nOf the franchises of the two movies I'm going to go with the devil's rejects over house without some courses whereas I'll go with evil dead to over or May of darkness or the original evil dead I think evil that too\nIs a great movie that really just created amazing character is why you have the character keep coming back\nAnd Bruce Campbell with the sold off hand in the movie explains why is Han that'd be taken off because of the game ... than it is a comedic but it's also you know body just morphine like mutilation like I'm not cut my end all fair like there's weird concepts introduced but then on the way around right [laughter]\nI mean does that and then it bleeds End Days and I like and\nI don't know army ... is a little too far in the comedy or thing or a darkness goes too far into the comedy absurd like okay like it's just it's I still like it but that one really makes me laugh words evil that to make me laugh and it makes me go oh God like the basement monsters great oh and\nThe reason I put it over house with a thousand corpses is because the devil's rejects as in my mind the movie with that cast\nThat I always go back to\nI think it has the better delivery and he gets better as a filmmaker Rob Zombie does and in that movie\nAnd it's hard to beat those characters because an evil that to the acting is very B movie very on purpose or campaign on purpose the gap\nFrom evil dead one to two you could see the age difference and Bruce Campbell interview looks like he's twelve and then he gets a little older and got above up a little\nAnd and and the first one he burns in Decorah nominate but it's back and I just I don't know I mean there's going to stop delivering this and I'm Sorry or to the soon to be wedded but uh\nFacebook channel actually voted probably\nFacebook the crowd and the the few people to come and then um and then I'm with the crowd I Know what\nWent on with the people I Know what they want so evil that too when it's going forward\nGoing forth some given at the\nWhite House redneck and it was looking for a girlfriend that got stole by the vines she got molested by some trees [laughter] CNN she's basically don't go into Bush she goes in the woods the vines taker and then if you watch closely they take advantage over ... oh my good\nSide of the wire you\nWell know and Emily sit over here kind of squirming but there was a worry with house of a thousand courses on of early cut did they get an ... Seventeen rating visitors decker feely or\nAn all sorts of crazy craft that see NO NAME of the ... right it and I actually agree with devil's ... I was watching devil's rejects one night and it was just me and like my brother and my current roommate a long time for an Andrew or watching it and\nNot having a second thought it's a very intense graphic movie crazy scenes in that movie and then my brother's girlfriend now his fiance will soon be my sister in law next year\nI went and I know where that well and she walked in\nAnd there's some maybe it's like ... have you ever watched a movie like with a kid with for the first time and or your with watching it with your parents somebody you don't know where your standards of what are these people think of me and what I'm watching so she walks in and it's the scene where they have the people held hostage in a motel room\nAnd they're trying to get these folks to do all sorts of stuff\nAnd I'm like oh God what are we watching in front of this lovely person like I feel so terrible right now of course she's cool like she can become a doctor she'll see all sorts of gruesome crap and a profession she grows up [noise] but uh you know\nAnyway I'm putting evil dead too because I think you can watch it with anybody\nJust remember when the ball flies [noise] if you look close you'll see the string\n[laughter]\nSo I Love ashes evil that there was no chance there's there's no chance when you put this matchup together whenever okay when the monster is in the basement and she's stick their head under the door and then he jumps on it and I'll ball goes flying out you see the stirring in an odd ball goes in old Bob Joe's mouth and she swallows it [laughter]\n[laughter] [noise] that's great so what should we go to\nNext folks\nI'm thinking thirteenth ghost or not in the living dead because we think this is a slam dunk and we don't much time before the break\nThat was creepy Bob are not spooky creepy\nI won't be creepy ...\nNot as living did not live in the living dead\nThere's respect for that yeah it was the first it was the first site I mean\nYellow has like the Lon Chaney version that Santa the offer on here which I consider a horror film when we don't so I Can't apply that classic label I still stay with Thirteen Ghosts okay\nYou're a zombie movie yeah wow oh
